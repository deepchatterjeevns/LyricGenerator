"Yes I know I've been untrue and I have hurt you through and through
But please have a mercy on this heart of mine
Take me back and try me one more time
If my darling you could see just what your leaving's done to me
You'd know that love is still the tie that binds
Take me back and try me one more time
Now in my dreams I see your face it seems there's someone in my place
But does he know that you were once just mine
Take me back and try me one more time
If you just forgive me now I make it up to you somehow
I promise ne'er again to be unkind
Oh take me back and try me one more time one more time"
"(Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
We is screamin' through the valley
Where the Nishnabotna flows
Through the mud and crud and cornfields
Where the mari-ju-wana grows
'Cross the railroad tracks of Persia
Down the hills and up the dale
Had a CJ-5 with a four-wheel drive
And Smokey on my tail.
Well, he picked me up at exit 12
On the I-six-eighty ramp
I was doin' 67 per
When I rumbled through his trap
He commenced to whirl his flashin' lights
And he made his siren wail
I slipped on down to four-wheel drive
With Smokey on my tail
Now I got racin' stripes and dual pipes
And Smokey's got a Ford
Got a mill with a four pot carb, you know
But Smokey's stroked and bored
Well, the chase was on, but I had the edge
With a rig that'll never fail
Got a CJ-5 with a four-wheel drive
And Smokey on my tail
Yeah, he was.
Well, I dropped on down to granny low
And I made a hard right turn
My big ol' fat Commando tires
Went slashin' through the corn
Well, the tassels blew
And the kernels flew
And it looked like yella hail
Just cookin' alive in a four-wheel drive
With Smokey on my tail
Well, we went screamin' through the valley
Where the Nishnabotna flows
Through the mud and crud and cornfields
Where the mari-ju-wana grows
'Cross the railroad tracks of Persia
Up the hills and down the dales
My CJ-5 with four-wheel drive
And Smokey on my tail.
[Imagine a series of comic-style thought balloons.]
Look out, now. Here he come.
Oh, we gonna get it on now.
(Don't hit that fella with the banjo.)
We gonna swim this here creek now, Smokey. [Pronounced ""crick"", of course.]
Yard wide and a foot deep.
""Nishnabota River"", they call it.
Might haveta winch out.
Gonna do a wheelie on that there gopher mound now, Smokey.
Can you dig it, Smokey?
Got four on the floor and four in the air on that one, didn't we?
Goodness gracious. 'Bout ta bust my shocks.
[Back to our regularly-scheduled rhyming. Add the sound of wailing sirens.]
Well, that Jeep of mine made Smokey whine
His rig was made of lead
He was mired in fourteen feet of mud
So he radioed ahead
I pulled up onto the blacktop
Went crashin' on through the rail
Sakes alive! I had twenty-five more
Smokeys on my tail!
Now I had racin' stripes and dual pipes
And Smokey had a Ford
Had a mill with a four pot carb, you know
But Smokey's stroked and bored
Well, the race was on, but I had the edge
With a rig that'll never fail
Got a CJ-5 with a four-wheel drive
Settin' out back a' the jail"
"There's a picture of you on my dresser
And it's been there since you said goodbye
And when I look in it's direction
You're starin' my heart straight in the eye
It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine
I wish I could tear it to pieces
And I've tried with all of my might
But somehow I can't find courage
Oh, to let you out of my sight
It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine"
"If I had my way forever there'd be a garden of roses for you and for me
A million and one things dear I would do just for you just for you
And if I had my way we'd never grow old sunshine I'd bring you every day
You'd reign all alone like a queen on a throne if I had my way
(If I had my way forever there'd be a garden of roses for you and for me
A million and one things I would do) just for you just for you
And if I had my way we'd never grow old...
If I had my way"
"Rivers turn to oceans and flow on to the sea, embers turn to ashes, and love to memories.
Rain turns to rainbows and gray skies turn to blue.
But when the world turns on me I turn to you.
A thirsty man needs water.
A bluebird needs the sky.
A man needs his woman or he'll wither up and die.
Roses need sunshine. Violets need the dew.
But not half as much as I need you.
Deep in my soul, and always on my mind, forever in my heart, you're the light that shines.
Someone to hold when no one else will do.
When the world turns on me I turn to you.
When the world turns on my I turn to you."
"Can you not see what you've done?
You gave your heart away like that.
I didn't want to fall in love with anyone, but you did.
I can still hear the song,
The melody behind the kiss you gave me.
You were wrong, I was right so I walked away,
And left you there, alone
I got so tired of talkin' on the telephone,
How many times would we say the words goodbye
I made mistakes, and one was telling you that I'd be there,
When telling time had come,
I should've said I didn't care.
Oh, the time I would have saved,
If I had been less willing to accommodate,
You'd been a little less likely to cry.
You go back to the high life,
And I'll go back to the low.
I should've known, but now I know
There'll be no word from you,
Describing how it felt to go through what I put you through.
It all makes perfect sense.
The way you cut the rope,
That kept you dangling from such pitiful amounts of hope
I would have cut it too."
"Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the rein
Bells are ringing and children singing
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight"
"And the great barge sank.
And the Okies fled.
And the great emancipater
Took a bullet in the head.
In the head,
Took a bullet in the back of the head.
It was not December.
Was not in May.
Was the 14th of April.
That is ruination day.
That's the day,
The day that is ruination day.
They were one.
They were two.
They were three.
They were four.
They were five hundred miles from their home.
From their home,
They were five hundred miles from their home.
When the iceberg hit
Well they must have known
That God moves on the water Casey Jones.
Casey Jones,
God moves on the water Casey Jones."
"Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy

"I know that I hurt you and I'm confessing
Since you've been gone I'm feeling mighty low
Please let me hear from you and keep me guessing
I need you more than you could ever know
Now I'm to blame I treated you unkind
I broke your heart and now you're breaking mine
I know I done you wrong and I'm confessing
Please take me back and try me one more time

How could I ever think I'll love another the way I treated you it was a crime
You are the only one I love no other please take me back and try me one more time
Now I'm to blame..."
"Imagine a dirt road full of pot holes
With a creek bank and some cane poles
Catching channel cat
I'm a little more country than that
Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the court house
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under, this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Think of a hank song from days gone
With a steel ride that's so strong
It sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who you're getting under this old hat
Cause girl I'm not the kind of two time or play games behind your back
I'm a little more country than that
Yeah, I'm sure that you've heard those three words from others
But they fell flat
But this ring ain't something that I mean to give you
And then take back
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that
I'm a little more country than that"
"Well I'm shamemeless when it comes to loving you

But if you need to be satisfied
I'm shameless, oh honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you
I have never let anything have this much control over me
I work too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now I can't refuse
I've never had so much to lose
Oh I'm shameless
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow
So I got to let it go
Oh I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You make a total fool of me
I just wanted to you to know
Oh I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh I'm shameless
Oh I'm down on my knees...shameless"
"I remember the day when the snow melted away and the great snowman was wed
He said yes I do and little Linda said it too and the great snowman was wed
Well Jimmy Jones was the snowman's name he put all the other local lovers to shame
He had good looks and a real fine car went around breaking all the pretty girls' hearts
Until one day the great snowman found Linda Lou started melting him down
He bought the ring and they named the day
And the great snowman started melting away
I remember the day...
Now the great snowman and his loving spouse live in a little subdivision house
They've got six kids and a mother in law another kiddie comin' in the fall
His old Cadillac needs the paint retouched it's full of baby diapers and bottles and such
The great snowman he has outgrown all his fancy cuddy clothes
I remember the day...
And the great snowman was wed"
"Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art oh
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul"
"If anyone ever finds a better way of love
It'll be her loving me
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care
It'll be her loving me
She's every woman that I've ever know rolled up in one
And if I never love anymore she'll be the one to get it done
The way it should be
It'll be her loving me
If ever I'm down and out and need some one to love
It'll her Loving me
If ever I'm in the cold and I need someone warm to hold

"I am reading today in my book of the past,
From it's pages so yellow and old.
Each memory of you as I read the book through
Is worth more than silver and gold.
(chorus)
I go back to the time I once called you mine
Oh, how happy the sweet long ago.
Each page that I turn seems to make my heart yearn
For the love I no longer share with you.
In this old book of mine many verses I find
That you wrote in the sweet used to be
In my heart there's regret, please forgive and forget
And rewrite all the pages for me
(repeat chorus twice)"
"I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only God knows how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darling the night they were playing the beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I was dancing with my darling..."
"If I ever lose my memory
so I don't even know my name
I'd still recognise the love inside your eyes
The love that shows
And my heart would know
If my eyes should ever fail me
If blindness ever struck me down
With a single fingers touch
from the hands I love so much
The love would flow
and my heart would know
My heart would know
in all it's faith
My heart moves on a different plane
Fear is a mountain
Love has scaled
Time and time again
If your lips should ever lie Dear
If you should set out to deceive
There's no way you could hide
What is going on inside
The lies would show
And my heart would know
My heart would know
In all it's faith
My heart moves on a different plane
Fear is a mountain
love has scaled
Time and time again
If you ever lose your memory
So you don't even know your name
You'll still recognise the love inside my eyes
The love would show
And your heart would know
And my heart would know"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"

"He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man not the kind to kill
But the jealous fight and a flashing blade
Sent him on the run through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now the posse went in and they came back out
And said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye the debt is paid
You won't last long in the Everglades
A man can't live in the everglades
Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the baying hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville
[ ac.guitar ]
Now the years went by and his girl was wed
His family gave him up for dead
Now and then the natives would say
They'd seen him a runnin' through the Everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the Everglades
Now he never heard the news on the radio
He was deep in the glades and he'll never know
He's runnin' and a hidin' and didn't make much sense
The jury had ruled it was self-defence
The jury had ruled it was self-defence
Where a man can hide..."

Whose arms are holding you tight so baby don't ever go
If arms were just harbors then you seen the world from one to another you sail

Whose arms are you in tonight...
No baby don't ever go"

She's got skin that's creamy dreamy
Eyes that look so lovey-dovey
Lips as red as cherry berry wine
Now listen Joe, I ain't no heel
But oh buddy let me tell you how I feel

I'm warnin' you I'm gonna try to steal her from you

Introduce that pretty little chick to me

You're as slow as any Joe can be
Now come on Joe let's make a deal
Let me dance with her to see if she is real

An' I tell ya face to face I mean to steal her from you

Well, I've got no choice but to follow you
That's a fact, I'd better face it

"Seeing your face in every child that smiles

And now I'm sure that you're alive

Still blessings we've received
And it's sad to say I really don't know a thing

Smell the sand of angels sweet road
And in the summer air
I have pretend to keep the incense
While the saints send up their prayers
I have tasted and now I see though
I see that you are good
And I have ate your perfume body
I have drank your blessed blood

Still blessings we've received

Will you think of me and how it ought a be in the mornin'
Well I don't know why you could say goodbye
And I can't see how you could be anywhere but here with me in the mornin'
Where was I when you made your move to go away
Where was I I didn't hear the things I've always heard or always said
Well it's no lie I never thought about it not a day
And I'll tell you why I really thought we always tried to say what should be said
When the sun comes up"
"It's gonna be a long, hot summer
The heat's gonna come for sure
Making you love me might take longer
But down here everything is slow
Sheets are blowin' on the clothesline
Honeysuckle makes it smell so sweet
The way they feel when ya lay down on 'em
You can't get from no machine
I know you come down every season
Waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do no harm
Go ahead and put your summer dress on
The sky's bright and the water's fine
And if you don't feel like swimmin'
We can find a bank and wet a line
'Cause I know up there in the city
Ain't no space to run 'round in
Down here we got dirt streets
Your bare feet can't help but settle down in
I know you come down every season
Waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'
A little sun won't do no harm
Grandpa's farm
I'll show you around if you come outside
Ain't no need in hidin' yourself anyhow
I'll show you around if you come outside
Ain't no need in hidin' yourself anyhow
I'll show you around if you come outside
Ain't no need in hidin' yourself anyhow
I know you come down every season
Waste time on your grandpa's farm
I ain't tryin' to talk you out of leavin'

Yeah, I can show you around
Yeah, I can show you around
If you come outside
Ain't no need in hidin' yourself"
"JEALOUS HEARTED ME
Writer A.P. Carter
Takes a rocking chair to rock takes a rubber tire to roll
Takes the man I love to satisfy my soul
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
Got a stove in the kitchen and it bakes nice and brown
But I need a poppa to turn the damper down
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
You can have my money you can have my home
But for goodness sake women leave my man alone
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be
Gonna buy me a bulldog to watch him while I sleep
To watch that man of mine on his midnight creep
Because I'm jealous, jealous hearted me
I said I'm jealous, jealous as I can be"
"She said ""Honey, do you think I'm smart?""
I said ""Of course you are
aint you lying here in my arms?""
She smiled, ""Well does this shirt make me look fat?""
I kinda leaned back and laughed
and I said, ""Honey, what kind of question is that?""
You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world that could ever make me
feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
You can fuss about your hair
Say you ain't got no clothes to wear
And when you finally make up your mind,
you go and change one more time
We can go out on Friday nights
A pretty girl could walk on by
If you really think I'd check her out
Come on now
You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world that could ever make me
feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
and all my stubborn ways
Putting up with the messes I make
I even ruined our first date
Girl, for goodness sakes!
You've gotta be crazy
to ever let a boy like me call you ""baby""
I thank God every day that you're my lady
Now that's a little crazy
So go on and be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me
Crazy over me"
"Greenfields backed by blue skies
'Bout as blue as your two true blue eyes
And I wonder do you feel the way I feel
When you see greenfields
Sometimes, oh, I wish you were still mine
And I'd go back in time and I'll always find
You in greenfields and you're layin' by my side
And love was real and I could taste it
On these lips of mine in
Greenfields backed by blue skies
'Bout as blue as your two true blue eyes
And I wonder do you feel the way I feel
When you see greenfields
When I see cotton candy clouds up in heaven
I close my eyes and then we drift away
And I'm loving you and holding on forever
There in your arms where I used to lay in"
"Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life
When the moon is full will you bathe with me
Will you still love me when I'm down and out
In my time of trials will you stand by me
Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you
Would you lay with me in a field of stone
If my needs were strong would you lay with me"
"Every morning the last couple of weeks
In between shaving and brushing my teeth
I'd lean on the sink and practice my lines
By now you would think they'd be memorized
But leave it to me to come all this way
Get down on one knee and forget what to say
I'm at a loss, should have known this is how it would be
'Cause you have that effect on me
I must admit I still don't understand
Why I lose my head holding your hand
There's no explanation, no simple excuse
For this intoxication I feel around you
And now truth be known since I've met you girl
I've been walkin' around in my own little world
One look in my eyes and darlin' any fool could see
That you have that effect on me
You've had your eyes on a two carat ring
I finally went out and I bought it
Right now it's at home sittin' on my TV
Would you believe I forgot it
But you can't blame me 'cause it's plain to see
That you have that effect on me
Yeah, you have that effect on me
Girl, you have that effect on me"
"Someday when I'm awfully low when the world is cold I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
Oh but you're lovely with your smiles so warm and your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you just the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose touches my foolish heart
Lovely never never change keep that breathless charm won't you please arrange it
Cause I love you just the way you look tonight just the way you look tonight"
"There he goes gone again
Same old story's gotta come to an end
Lovin' him was a one way street
But I'm gettin' off where the crossroads meet
Quarter moon in a ten cent town
It's time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night I'm gonna make myself a name
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain
It's gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high
In a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy from now on
Raw as whip but clean as a bone
Soft to the touch when you take me home
When the mornin' comes and it's time for me to leave
Don't worry about me
I got a wild card up my sleeve"
"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away, so it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself and I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from working late
'Cause I would know that she'd been sittin' there
And crying over some sad and silly late late show
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be guess
You could say she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly and found her crying
Needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom
And robins sing she went away
And honey I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
One day while I was not at home
And she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage where honey lived
And honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed where honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day
That she planted it was just a twig"
"Welcome to Love City population two
It isn't a big place our little town
But it's filled with lovely sights all around
A park filled with flowers a beautiful lawn
The streets of the driveway that leads to our home
Just a small house on an acre of ground
We call it Love City our little town
Welcome to Love City polulation two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Between me and you
We built our home on Love's Avenue
The taxes are low and it has a nice view
We've got home cooked meals that are fit for a king
And all kinds of love to fill every dream
A room just for friends if they happen to
Visit our Love City population two"
"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who
I use to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
Mmmm"
"Oh
There's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'd never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightning
Threw some punches then we had a laugh
Just some roughed up desperados
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
Who'd thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?
Just some roughed up desperados
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
And I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
Yeah
Here we go
Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high, I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh, woah-oh
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
And I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah"
"I found your note and that was all she wrote
You might as well just have cut my throat
You said, I'm doing this for your own sake
And all of this has been a big mistake
It doesn't matter what you think is best
This is a matter of life and death
You said, it hurts me more than it does you
Then why am I turning all these shades of blue
You had me thinkin' it was paradise
All of a sudden it was cold, thin ice
I've fallen under, trying to catch my breath
This is a matter of life and death
You set me up to let me down
You took the love I couldn't live without
Two fatal words 'Bye, Bye'
Without your love you know I'll surely die
I never begged for anything before
I'm close to knockin' on St.Peter's door
Come on baby, I'm down on my knees
You know my heart will never rest in peace
Grant me the only with that I have left
This is a matter of life and death
Don't kill the only one alive that loves you the best
This is a matter of life and death"
"Once was a woman and once was a man
Who'd never been lovers, just good friends
Both of them happy with rings on their hands
But they'd dreamed of each other, romance
So picture two people alone in a room
Together for the very first time
Candles are burning, holding each other
And picture two people whose dreams have come true
They must be goin' out of their minds
If for only a moment seems like forever
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
Now no one can know what a love is to life
Till they have to choose one, lose one
And no one can know what a heartache is like
Till they have to break one, take one
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
Now, there is a woman and there is a man
Who used to be good friends, now they're just lovers
Their dreams of forever must come to an end
And stop all this madness, somehow recover
So picture two people alone in a room
Who finally have made up their minds
Oh, how the tears flow, both know
And picture them holdin' each other real tight
Knowing it's the very last time
They gotta let go, let go
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches"
"When we had our fights
I knew that our love wouldn't last that long
So when you broke my heart
I knew I'd have to leave town all alone
And 'cause I was so mad
I didn't wanna see your face again
Now I'm 46 miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Now people seem to ask
Why I'm always crying all the time
But I don't speak of faded love
So I just walk away and say that I'll be fine
My heart is broke in two
And my eyes will cry a river of love
Yes I'm 46 miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Now when I sleep at night
Well I pray that when I wake I'll be at home
But when the morning comes
Well I lie and I cry 'cause I was wrong
But I'm oh so far away
And I'm out of town and oh so far from home
Yes I'm 46 miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home.
Yes I'm 46 miles from Alice
And I'm thousands of miles from my home."
"As much as the stars need the heaven
As much as the roses need dew
As much as the plea in a baby's cry
Well, that's how much I need you
As much as the flowers need sunshine
As much as the sky needs the blue
As much, as much as my love is true
Well, that's how much I need you
I need you, I need you to guide me
This much I know it's true
You alone are my inspiration
In everything I do
As much as the stars need the heaven
Well, that's how much I need you"
"When you say love you're telling everyone your moment's come
And you've found out what you've been looking for
When you say love you've said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore
You've got a pretty rainbow of your own
And at last you've found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied a feeling of contentment fills your soul
When you say love it means you've found your special one
And that you care enough to give your very best
When you say love there's not another word that says so much
But that four-letter word means happiness
Your heart has given wings to touch the sky
Much higher than the eagle dares to fly
If you took everything you've heard and tried to make a magic word
You'll find you've said it all when you say love
When you say love it means you've found your special one...
When you say love"

It don't matter what you do and it don't matter what you say
Honey you know I'll be lovin' you anyway yes I will
And it don't matter if you come to stay or if you come to play
Honey you know I'll be lovin' you anyway
I'll be lovin' you fast and lastly longin'ly on your birthday and in between
When your friends all up and gone I'm the one you can count on
It don't matter if it lasts forever or just today
Honey you know I'll be lovin' you anyway

I'll be lovin' you rain or shine snow or sleet in the alley or on the street
Anytime anyway anyhow anywhere turn around and I'll be there

"Let's not fight it anymore unpack the bags and close the door
I'll never leave you
Though you lied right from the start I can't convince my stupid heart
Not to believe you
You've got two good men strung out and there's not the slightest doubt
That other men have loved you before
Oh but you work your thing so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore
If I had one ounce of pride I'd stand up or step aside
But girl I love you
So I'll accept the crumbs you drop cause I'm a fool and I can't stop
Or rise above you
Let other speak up for themselves I speak for me and no one else
Cause I'm a beggar knocking on your door
Oh you work your things so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore

I'm too far gone to turn around to lift myself up off the ground
And start all over
Now him or I must win or lose no matter which one you may choose
You'll be in clover
Darling while you're making up your mind I'll be praying all the time
That you will never never be letting me go
Oh you work your thing so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore
Oh you work your thing so well I'll dream of heaven and live in hell
Till I can't take it anymore

"She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Now a woman like that, all she does is hate you
She doesn't know what makes a man a man
She'll talk about the time that she's been with you
She'll speak your name to everyone she can
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can do without
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
It's alright to call her but I'll bet you
The moon is full and you're just wasting time
She's a devil in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
She's tellin' dirty lies, she's a devil in disguise, in disguise
In disguise, in disguise

Tell me what else can I say
The closer that I get to you
The further you push me away

Or am I some little game you play
Are you ever gonna need me baby
Like I need you
Are you ever gonna want me baby
The way I want you too
I know that you love me
Oh baby down deep inside I know that you do
But are you ever gonna love me
The way that I love you
I never know how you feel
'Cause baby I can't read your mind
Do i just keep waiting, or am i just wasting time
Are you ever gonna need me baby
Like I need you
Are you ever gonna want me baby
The way I want you to
I know that you love me
Oh baby down deep i know that you do
But are you ever gonna love me baby
Are you ever gonna love me baby
The way I love you"
"DADDY WAS AN OLD TIME PREACHER MAN
(Dolly Parton - Dorothy Jo Hope)
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's
Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man"
"(VERSE 1)
If I told you that I was wrong
and wanted you to come back home,
I'd be lying.
And if I said that we could work it out
and you shouldn't have any doubts,
I'd be lying.
And if I got down on my knees
in front of God above
and swore before the angels
I'd give you my love.
I'd be lying next to you tonight
holding on with my whole life.
Right back where I belong.
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
that honey, I was wrong.
If I could swallow my pride
and put myself in your shoes
and tell you that I understand
why you feel the way you do
then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
(VERSE 2)
And if I told you that I loved you
and I put no one else above you,
I'd be lying.
And if I said you're the one for me
and I never set you free,
I'd be lying.
And if I somehow found the strength
to knock on your front door
and tell you face to face
I won't hurt you anymore.
I'd be lying next to you tonight.
Holding on with my whole life.
Right back where I belong.
Looking deep into your eyes
Man enough to realize
that honey, I was wrong.
If I could swallow my pride
and put myself in your shoes
and tell you that I understand
why you feel the way you do.
Then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
If I could swallow my pride

why you feel the way you do.
Then baby, I'd be lying...
I'd be lying next to you.
Next to you...
If I told you I was wrong...
If I said that we could work it out...
If I got down on my knees...
Oh baby, I'd be lying..."
"Blue trail of sorrow
Lies upon the ground
And I get so lonely
Since you let me down
Well, I used to be so happy
Walkin' on these streets
Now there's just sadness
Everywhere I meet
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground
Now when I had a dollar
You'd stick right by me
Now I've got nothin'
But blues for company
Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow
I'm tired of this old town
But it won't be hard to find me
If you look down on the ground
Start walkin', baby, walk all over town
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground"
"(Chip Davis, Bill Fries)
On a cold November mornin'
Back in nineteen-thirty-seven
With an early snow a-fallin'
On the three-foot tracks at Ames
Came a mighty strange contraption
Known to trainmen as a motor
But to folks in Colorado
She was known by another name
Up the canyons south of Sawpit
Past the red Cathedral spires
'Cross the yellow mountain switchbacks
And the rapids far below
On the high and lofty trestles
Near the fabled mines of Ophir
In the silver San Juan Mountains
Came a goose a-plowin' snow
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine,
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' Goose
'Twas a four-door auto-mobile
On a dozen wheels of iron
Sixteen feet of rockin' boxcar
Spot-welded to her tail
Loaded down with mercantile
Ten bags a' high-grade ore
Two mothers nursin' babies
Seven miners an' the mail
Up the side a' Sunshine Mountain
By internal gas combustion
Eight Pierce-Arrow pistons pullin'
Fifteen thousand pounds a' lead
At the snowshed on the summit
The conductor said his prayers
He declared a busted driveshaft
On the pass at Lizard Head
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' Goose
[Musical interlude here.]
Down the three-percent to Rico
In the valley of Dolores
They still talk about the Southern
An' her flock of flyin' geese
From the roundhouse at Ridgway
To the depot at Durango
All the tracks are gone for scrap iron
And the ganders rest in peace
Up the canyons south of Sawpit
Past the red Cathedral spires
'Cross the yellow mountain switchbacks
And the rapids far below
On the high and lofty trestles
Near the fabled mines of Ophir
In the silver San Juan Mountains
There's a legend in the snow
[Chorus]
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came the Rio Grande Southern
The Gallopin' Goose
With a Pierce-Arrow engine
Runnin' hot and on the loose
Came Number Five, The Gallopin' Goose"
"Will the real me please stop crying and let me let me forget
There are three faces that I wear the first says I don't care
The second one knows he's lying
The third one hide the heart that's been broken all apart
Will the real me please stop crying
Will the real me please stop crying lonely lonely tears of regret
Will the real me please stop crying and let me let me forget
[ steel ]
All three faces belong to me but there's one that no one sees
All of them know his love's dying
Two of them want to lie but the other just wants to cry
Will the real me please stop crying
Will the real me please stop crying..."

And like so many times before
I say, I love you, too

'Cause I've never been too good
At telling you a lie
And it's just so hard to do

To know Ive got one on my hands
There must be something going on
That I dont know about
I got a feeling 'fore the weekends over
Shell be moving out
Oh, but so far so she hasnt packed a thing at all
She hasnt made a call, she must be thinking it over
So far so good she hasnt done what I thought she would
So far so good
Oh, the nights are the hardest to handle
So many things in my head
How much longer can I go on
Just taking a memory to bed
Im so afraid theres somebody else
Lord, I hope Im wrong
But I can't help feeling that one of these mornings
Ill be waking up alone
Oh, but so far so she hasnt packed a thing at all
She hasnt made a call, she must be thinking it over
So far so good she hasnt done what I thought she would
So far so good, so far, so far so good"

"In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities all the nations
Everything that falls your way
There is a deeper wave than this
That you don't understand
There is a deeper wave than this
Tugging at your hand
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see
There is a deeper wave than this
Swelling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
Feel it rising in the cities
Feel it sweeping over land
Over borders, over frontiers
Nothing will its power withstand
There is no deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is no deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
All the bloodshed, all the anger
All the weapons, all the greed
All the armies, all the missiles
All the symbols of our fear
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
At the still point of destruction
At the center of the fury
All the angels, all the devils
All around us, can't you see
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand
I say love is the seventh wave"
"a single red rose and a table for two
a nice chardonnay and an ocean view
ships comin in stars comin' out
we sat and we talked 'til the place closed down
then we took a long walk down on the beach
her in that white dress in her bare feet
we stopped and we watched the lighthouse light
i pulled her close and i held on tight
and i said
to myself
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
fast forward to that next spring
we were lookin for a preacher pickin out rings
family comin in and friends comin out
to that little white church on the outskirts of town
me and that tux fightin butterflies
tears of joy in my mama's eyes
her daddy walkin her down that aisle
i lifted that veil and i saw that smile
and i said
to her
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
just when i start thinkin it's as good as it can get
this crazy life does somethin
just to let me know
i haven't seen anything yet

there we were flyin down the interstate
car weavin in and car weavin out
through traffic runnin every red light in town
delivery room and the doctor comes in
i'm right beside her she's squeezin my hand
one more push and a baby cries
a sweet little angel with her mama's eyes
and i said
to my girls
it doesn't get better than this
no it doesn't get better than this
and it did
it did
oh it did
yes it did

"You were mine for just awhile
Now you're putting on the style
And you never once looked back
At your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down
Well, they've changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so rude
But underneath, you're still the same
Hey, I know they're to blame
If you find these thing are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down
Yeah, pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When the glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
When they take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down"
"Nobody loves a drink anymore than me I might buy a round or two or three
And I've been known to stumble and hit the floor
Oh but I'm never too drunk to make it to the door
Red wine can start my head a swimmin' but I draw the line when it comes to women
I never met a woman that could make me roam and I do my swinging at home
She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong
I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking
Cause I do my swinging at home
She gives me more love better love sweeter love true love and that's where I belong
I might do a lotta talking but soon you'll see me walking
I do a lotta swinging a lotta love song singing but I do my swinging at home"
"Well they shouldn't have played that good,
I got carried away and let the music,
Go to my head.
Well she shouldn't have worn that dress,
The way it curled around when she was spinnin',
Just killed me dead.
My heart began to tell my body and my soul,
That it had gotten in the mood to lose control.
Oh no!
When did neon light turn into moon glow?
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance,
With her arms around me,
One more long glance,
And nothing will slow down me,
I've got no chance,
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge.
All I wanted to be was cool.
It ain't my style to over heat,
Much less burn.
But as we floated across the floor,
All at once I flashed right past the point,
Of no return.
And when we said goodnight,
The sun was on the rise,
And any stars that hadn't set,
Had fallen in my eyes.
Oh no!
When did neon light turn into moon glow?
When did that jukebox turn into a rainbow?
I'm about to give into this urge.
Once more slow dance,
With her arms around me,
One more long glance,
And nothing will slow down me,
I've got no chance,
If I'm not in love I'm on the verge."
"summertime and i drive, aint no place weve gotta be
i can take my eyes off you, you keep looking back at me
i just sigh, no sense of time, blazing down the open road
lets get as close as we can get, go as far as we can go
take me to heaven in the middle of nowhere, i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
just you and me, where we end up i dont care. i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
to heaven in the middle of nowhere
summertime and i drive, heavens blowing in a breeze
look too good to watch you both, so i just keep sneaking peeks
miles passed, your feet on the dash, toes keep tapping to the groove
of two young hearts set on fire from the light of the moon
take me to heaven in the middle of nowhere, i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
just you and me, where we end up i dont care. i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
to heaven in the middle of nowhere
take me to heaven in the middle of nowhere (in the middle of nowhere), i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
take me to heaven in the middle of nowhere, i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
just you and me, where we end up i dont care. i
cant wait to get there
cant wait to get there
to heaven in the middle of nowhere
heaven in the middle of nowhere
yeah yeah
heaven in the middle of nowhere
mmm.. take me there"
"The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
On and on we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home"
"Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
I'm glad you hear that both of them are happy
I hope he's finally found what he never found with me
Tell him that you saw me and be sure to say hello
But promise me one thing before you go
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that there's no way my broken heart can mend
Don't tell him that I'm still crying
Don't let him know that losin' him was more than I could stand
Don't tell him that I'm still crying..."
"What a fool
Thought I'd wrapped up the case
I went and promised my heart
But you just laughed in my face
What a fall
Never thought I'd forget you
I gave it all
But I've got no regret
I loved you
I cared
[Chorus:]
So if by chance you walk my way
And feel the joy and pain of yesterday
You'll never need a reason to pretend
A simple smile is all I ask
The smile you hide behind your painted mask
Somewhere between a stranger and a friend
What a crime
When you want someone so
I put my heart on the line
But I had to let go
It's over
[Chorus]
Now, my love, it's over
[Chorus]
(You'll never know you've hurt me baby) walk my way"
"Shes got her new jeans on
Lookin' so right its wrong
Ummm everybody stares as she walks on by
See those double takes
Hear those slammin' breaks
Yeah when she smiles you can see the sparks fly
My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walkin' beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at startin' fires
But Im the only one
Aint no doubt
Only one that puts them out
Shes got her long red dress
And boy I must confess
Ummm when you see her she'll take your breath away
When we're out on the town
Eyes look her up and down
Yeah she makes the night time hotter than a summer day
My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walkin' beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at startin' fires
But Im the only one
Aint no doubt
Only one that puts them out
Im a lucky man and I know its true
Her fire burns for me
Yeah thats just so cooool
My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walkin' beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at startin' fires
But Im the only one
Aint no doubt
Only one that puts them out
My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walkin' beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at startin' fires
But Im the only one
Aint no doubt
Only one that puts them out"
"For sale and a number on a sign at the end of the drive.
Plastic toys and a swingset all tangled up in grass that's grown knee high.
I walked up on the front porch of the house where our love made its last stand.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
I stood there on the welcome mat and discovered they forgot to lock the door.
I was glad that it was open, cause my old key don't fit here anymore.
On the wall of the living room I saw markings and a crayon drawn stick man.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
How can you put a price on someone's piece of life I'd like to know.
Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of
the bedroom where we made love and plans.
Chorus
There's a thousand memories that are now in real estate hands.
How can you put a price on someone's piece of life I'd like to know.
Something so precious can't be bought or sold. Like that corner of

"I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
Just a country boy that combed his hair
And put on a shirt his mother made and went on the air
And he shook it like a chorus girl
And he shook it like a Harlem queen
He shook it like a midnight rambler,
Baby,
Like you never seen
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
How he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
He shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
I was thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he died
He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was that he fell down and died
When he shook it and he rang like silver
He shook it and he shine like gold
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul
He shook it and he beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, what's wrong with me?"
"I said hello I think I'm broken
And though I was only joking
It took me by surprise when you agreed.
I was trying to be clever
For the life of me I never
Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead.
You knew all my lines
You knew all my tricks
You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix
And I bless the day I met you
And I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone.
Looking back it's still surprising
I was sinking you were rising
And with a look you caught me in mid air.
Now I know God has his reasons
But sometimes it's hard to see them
I lie awake and find that you're not there.
You found hope in hopeless
You made crazy sane
You became the missing link that helped me break my chains.
And I bless the day I met you
And I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone.
Umm umm
Ohh ohh you're gone
Ohhh you're gone!"
"Accidentally in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me from just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
And just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Yes, everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Stayed just long enough to fall in love with you"
"In a lonely room, waiting for the night to fall
I hear your voice in every whip-poor-will that calls
And it takes me back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was your's and you were mine
As the shadows fall and the light grows dim I see your face
I close my eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace
As I long for you and for all those days when hearts entwined
When I was your's and you were mine
When I was your's and you were mine
When I was your's and you were mine, a truer love in Caroline
Ever waltzed across these hills and danced beneath the stars
Life was sweeter than the flowers blooming on the vine
When I was your's and you were mine
So I lay my head on a pillow soft and stained with tears
I cry for you through all the long and lonely years
But when I dream till the morning sun comes to shine
Then I'll be your's and you'll be mine"
"Today I started loving you again
And so I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
On only these few million tears I've cried
Then I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
And so I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Yes, today I started loving you again"
"The nights were dark and long I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still my dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another but I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
I prayed to God to guide you till I could be beside you
But I never once stopped loving you
I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back, my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you"
"Well that needle that climbed to 195 MPH
And this boot of mine wants
To kick that pedal straight in the face
This ain't that kinda night
There ain't no finish line
No, this ain't a race
I bought the bench not the buckets
And I'm feeling lucky
So slide on into me baby
We're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Ain't running no, running no
Red lights tonight
Just sitting in park
Oh, hugging every curve
Of that long lane road
400 horses on a slow road
That Camaro kiss, two lonely hearts
Yeah, we're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, two kids starting fire
And that cigarette lighter
Don't even work, ha ha
It's a windows fogging up
Kinda love spitting through
A torn up Haggard t-shirt
Well take those big blue eyes
Baby watch those thighs
Don't knock us outta first
Yeah, the heat is on the rise
I'm trying to memorize
Every single one of your curves
We're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Ain't running no, running no
Red lights tonight
Just sitting in park
Oh, hugging every curve
Of that long lane road
400 horses on a slow road
That Camaro kiss, two lonely hearts
Yeah, we're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
With the radio on
Riding the brakes
We ain't got nothing
But time to waste
So let's take
The long way home girl
Whatcha say
Yeah, taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Ain't running no, running no
Red lights tonight
Just sitting in park
Oh, hugging every curve
Of that long lane road
400 horses on a slow road
That Camaro kissed two lonely hearts
Yeah, we're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Yeah, we're taking our sweet time
In a real fast car
Yeah, yeah, yeah"
"I just took your picture off the table
And I just took your picture off the wall
Hide from you anywhere I'm able
But there's one place I can't hide from you at all
[Chorus]
Tennessee, you don't make the whiskey
California, you don't make the wine
And Mexico, you don't make tequila
Strong enough to get her off my mind
Memories seem to know just where to find me
And lately they're all that I recall
And everything in this old house reminds me
Of the love I had and how I lost it all
[Chorus]
Days go by and I still feel the sorrow
And time don't make a difference in the pain
Just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
Will drive me crazy if I don't go insane
[Chorus]
Strong enough to get her off my mind
Strong enough to get her off my mind"
"Cowboy, you're like a Mustang driftin' with the wind
Riding clear of fences that might close you in
Your wild, restless spirit keeps you searchin' for higher ground
You don't get close to brandin' fires, you'll never be tied down
Oh, last night the lady, she took you by surprise
And threw a loop around your heart when she looked into your eyes
Branded by the tender touch of her soft gentle hand
Now this hard ridin' cowboy, this wild driftin' cowboy
Will never ride into the sunset again
The night wind through the canyon makes such a mournful sound
Freedom, your old partner, well, he just let you down
It's snowin' on the mountain, the trail to drifted in
You try to fight the feelin' but cowboy you'll never win
But last night the lady, she took you by surprise
And threw a loop around your heart when she looked into your eyes
Branded by the tender touch of her soft gentle hand
Now this hard ridin' cowboy, this wild driftin' cowboy
Will never ride into the sunset again"
"Baby who do you think is better than you?
Do you know everything that they go through?
Have they taken you on their closet tour?
You'd find a few skeletons I am sure
You think everyone's kicking up their feet
And you show the life of easy street
You gotta make it fair and maintain
Improve your lifestyle and it's the same thing
Life at best is a struggle
Life at best can be trouble
Store upon love staying' humble
It's all the gas baby life at best
They sure cover everything these days
Don't fall for the TV or some magazine page
Not much gets solved with a ? one take
What you work hard for is the thing that pays
You gotta make it fair and maintain
Improve your lifestyle and it's the same thing
Life at best is a struggle
Life at best can be trouble
Store upon love staying' humble
It's all the gas baby life at best
Life at best is anybody's guess
Life at best is anybody's guess
Life at best is anybody's guess
Life at best is anybody's guess
Life at best
Life at best is a struggle
Life at best can be trouble
Store upon love staying' humble
It's all the gas baby life at best"
"[Chorus: ]
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song
He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side
She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar
He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
'Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away
[Chorus: ]
We all cling to
As the years keep rolling on
One single promise
Of a love that's past and gone
And that lonesome valley
We all walk it by ourselves
With the wildwood flower
Is a story we will tell
[Chorus: ]
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
And all we have left of her is a song"
"Drop Kick Me, Jesus
(Chorus)
Drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life
End over end, neither left nor to right
Straight through the heart of them righteous uprights
Drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life
Make me, oh make me, Lord more than I am
Make me a piece in your master game plan
Free from the earthly temptations below
I?E?ve got the will, Lord if you?E?ve got the toe
(Chorus)
Bring on the brothers who?E?ve gone on before
And all of the sisters who?E?ve knocked on your door
All the departed dear loved ones of mine
Stick them up front in the offensive line
(Chorus 2x)
Oh, drop kick me, Jesus through the goal posts of life"
"Storm clouds are building above the timber line
The lightning's flashing across the mountain side
The thunder's rollin' down the canyons of his mind
Somewhere beyond the great divide
The bugle of the bull elk echos through pines
The north wind moans her lonesome lullaby
He hungers for the freedom of an eagle as she flies
Somewhere beyond the great divide
[Chorus]
He's heard the call of the wild
He's heard the call of the wild
The mountains callin' to him like a mother calls her child
He's heard the call of the wild
Livin' in the city oh it gets to be a grind
Puttin' in his hours workin' overtime
Waitin' for the day he can leave it all behind
To go somewhere beyond the great divide
He's got to get away from the city for a while
He's gotta answer the call of the wild
[Chorus]"
"I used to think love was
The soft rope meant to tie me down
And all that could ever own me
Was a guitar and another town
Ten years can disappear real fast
When every morning just leaves somewhere else behind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Lyin' here beside you
I can feel it start to pull me away
The thought I'll have again tomorrow
That just came back from yesterday
But your embrace makes any reason
For those memories hard to find
And I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Sometimes I miss the warm, bright lights
Sometimes I miss the crowds
Sometimes I miss the women
I wrapped each song around
Sometimes I miss that world out there
So empty, hard and unkind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
Sometimes I miss the warm, bright lights
Sometimes I miss the noise
Sometimes I miss the fading sounds
Of every cheering voice
Sometimes I miss that world out there
So empty, hard and unkind
But I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind
I've been thinking about leaving
Long enough to change my mind"
"Looking in the mirror
Must be harder than you thought
Truth is not a pretty sight to see
Cheatin' ain't worth cheatin' honey
When you're gettin' caught
Lovin' him while losin' you and me
Maybe I was foolish
Sometimes dreamers often are
I believed that you believed in me
Standing in love's quick sand honey
Reaching for a star
Looking for your love to set me free
I've seen all the dreams
I ever thought was coming true
Shattered like a mirror in your hall
Leaving your reflection like a four letter word
Fading quickly from some bathroom wall
Trying to understand love
Is the hardest part of all
Does it really matter whose to blame
Once I called you honey
Now I never call at all
Knowing you could only call me names"
"You would think I was born yesterday, the way I act sometimes
Like I'd never heard your good message, deaf, dumb and blind
Speak harsh to my children, impatient with my lover
And that man on the street, he cut me off in traffic
You should've heard me scream
And just when I think I've pushed it too far
Worried about the battle and blowing the war
That's when I hear your voice in my ear with
Love so simple, love so plain
Coming down on me like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what I do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you
'Cause Lord, I carry these demons, temptation, ooh I've had my fun
But lately I've been thinking there's work to be done
I know how to be gentle, it's just that I forget
If someone makes me angry, someone's in a hurry
I can just let them just rush on by and take that deeper breath
Because this is the battle, yeah, this is the war
This is really worth fighting for
And I have no fear as long as you are near with
Love so simple, love so plain
Coming down on me like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what I do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you
These things I say and do I wish that you did not see
I'm thanking you now for never giving up on me with
Love so simple, love so plain
Coming down on all of us like the rain
With sweet forgiveness no matter what we do
And it makes me want to get just a little bit closer to you, ooh, closer"
"There's a slow moon rising
It's shining on your skin
The way your body moves me
I know there's no holding back
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man
If a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I can feel passion flowing
As you fall into my arms
The secret way you touch me
Tells me there's no holding back
No holding back
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
I wouldn't be a man
If a woman like you
Was anything I could resist
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this
Roll with me, baby
All night long
Soul to soul with me, baby
All night long
I'd have to be from another planet
Where love doesn't exist
I wouldn't be a man
If I didn't feel like this"
"Oh my Lord, Please don't forsake me
This is your child, I'm tired and sore
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need your love, my soul is poor
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
Oh my Lord, I can't remember
When I first said, ""Come in my life,""
For I have lived my life in darkness,
My whole world is filled with strife
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
I can hear, the angels singing
I can see those pearly gates
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest."
"Flying high above the clouds
We lay in the grassy meadow
The earth was like a pillow
For our dreams
Trials never entered into any conversation
That was the relation of our dreams
As a change in the wind must come
Over the mountain
And the seasons roll under the sun
Passing the shadows of our dreams"
"LEAVE ALL THE HEARTACHE TO ME
(Bill Anderson)
'61 Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY KITTY WELLS
If two other lips are what you long for
If our love is melodrama that just can't be
Go on out with someone else enjoy living
And leave all the heartache to me
I'll stay home and count the teardrops while you go out and party
I'll envy you for being so carefree
You can laugh and love with her and be contented
And leave all the heartache to me
Don't think upon our romance as a failure
Don't hate yourself for wanting to be free
Just look forward don't look backward and be happy
And leave all the heartache to me
I'll stay home and count the teardrops while you go out and party
I'll find comfort in a few old memories
You can laugh and love with her and be contented
And leave all the heartache to me"
"It all started in this little town
Way down in Texas
When I first heard old Johnny Cash
Singing prison blues
I picked my guitar like a fool
And read them country magazines
Keeping up to snuff on the Music City news
One Sunday morning found me there
On the streets of Nashville
Humming out the chorus to my latest melody
Well I whooped into old Tootsie's bar
And told them local pickers
I'd done come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
Can't you hear the music ringing
Can't you hear the singers singing
Can't you hear somebody humming on my homemade melody
The lost and found are searching here
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A.
One Sunday evening found me Lord
In a corner booth at Limebaugh's
Drinking black coffee and eating chili
Like Marty Robbins and Earnest Tubb
Set there tuning up my guitar
Lord, I couldn't wait until Monday morning
Figured if I couldn't make it then nobody could
Well the years have come and gone
I'm still here in Nashville
Stumbling up and down 16th and 17th Avenue
Bugging everybody here
That I can get to stop and listen
Trying hard to do all the things
I told my mom and dad that I was going to do
Can't you hear the music ringing
Can't you hear the singers singing
Can't you hear somebody humming on my homemade melody
The lost and found are searching here
And some new face from everywhere
Is come to capture Music City, U.S.A."
"You gotta walk that lonesome valley you gotta go there by yourself
There's no one here can go there with you you gotta go there by yourself
Mother said while she was dying and her breath was almost gone
Keep your trust in the Holy Bible it will guide you safely home
You gotta walk
If you cannot sing like angels if you cannot preach like Paul
You can tell the love of Jesus you can tell he died for all
You gotta walk"
"Turn the radio up
it's time to get down
Feeling high on the hopes in the wind
Your first lover to love and the lightning above
Taking off to where you've never been
Stick your cares in the air
you can go anywhere
When you're lookin' for the rainbow's end
Follow your nose
you're a rambling rose
And it might be just around the bend
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway 2-18
Live everyday
love it away
There's is a whole world you've never seen
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway 2-18
It's great to be young with a song in your lung
So hang on to your dreams
Let the rhythm roll on
let the wheels go 'round
The sky flying by is your friend
And chasing the blue comes natural to you
So now is the time to begin
Sling your fate to the preeze
You can do what you please
sing it out like a mandolin
Trust in your toes 'cause they knows where they goes
They're just following the feeling within . . .
Hang on to your dreams
On that highway 2-18 . . ."
"Darling it's not really over it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
These tiny drops of pain that's falling down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
[ guitar ]
In each love some pain must fall...
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall"
"Looking back into the world we knew
When love was such a sweet surprise
Wasn't it beautiful how strangers came to love
Like magic right before our eyes
Strangers become friends and friends become lovers
But the same fire that warms the heart can burn
Then it's lovers, friends, strangers again
Ain't it funny how the circle turns
Looking back I'd do it all again
Although the story's sad but true
Even lovers can be strangers again
Stranger still I keep on loving you
Strangers become friends...
Ain't it funny how the circle turns"
"Looking back a hundred years
On daughters and sons of the land
Who're standing here, holding a fistful of dirt
Watching it slip through my hands
See the fields of sweat and tears
Where we labored in love
We cursed the wind and we prayed for rain
But never thought of giving it up
Oh, down on the farm
Oh, somebody's dreams are ending
When a way of life can be auctioned off
There's more than one fence that needs bending
It looks like to me, this country still needs
A muscle and two strong arms
If we can send a man up to the moon
We can keep a man down on the farm
Staring out of this factory window
Trying to make sense of it all
I remember on this very spot, corn standing ten feet tall
America, America, who do we blame it on?
It was only the family fund, who really cares if it's gone
Oh, down on the farm
Oh, somebody's dreams are ending
When a way of life can be auctioned off
There's more than one fence that needs bending
It looks like to me, this country still needs
A muscle and two strong arms
If we can send a man up to the moon
We can keep a man down on the farm
America, America, who do we blame it on?"

"It's never alright.
It comes and it goes.
Oh it's always around,
Even when it don't show.
They say it gets better.
Well I guess that it might.
But even when it's better,
It's never alright.
It's never okay.
Lonely moves here and there.
Sometimes it stays in one place and just stares.
They say that the darkness is just before light.
Each day may get brighter, but it's never alright.
I try real hard to remember as good as it gets.
But the harder and harder I try, all I can do is forget.
They say it gets better
Well I guess it might.
But even when it's better,
It's never alright.
It's never been mine, to win or to lose.
No it's always been yours, to pick or to choose.
They say love is better when set free now have time
But even when it's better, it's never alright.
Even if it gets better, it won't be alright."
"It's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good-looking
Hush, little baby don't you cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
No no no no
Don't cry, don't cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by, I know, don't cry
Summertime, summertime, summertime
And the living is, living is easy
Fish are, I know the fish are jumping
And cotton is so high
Your daddy is so, so rich and your mama good-
She had to be good-looking
So hush, little baby, don't you cry
Don't you cry, no no, don't cry
No need to cry, don't cry, don't cry
Summertime, summertime"
"There oughta be a faster way
To fill up a Malibu, I swear
Thank God today you can pay here at the pump
Oh, one little thing to make up time
To get me back out there
Headin down the road like a bullet from a gun
I bet she's in that flannel robe
Curled up by the file
Reading Bridget Jones for the fifteenth time
Every minute I'm not there
Is another I'll need forgiveness for
There's still 300 miles to care about
Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you
I wonder how it'll go down
When I pull up in the drive
Will she throw her arms around me
Or throw me out?
I can beg and plead my case
And say I need her in my life
But I can't do a thing from where I am right now
Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you
Mile after mile
Wheels turn so slow
Will I ever get back home
Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you
Everything is in slow motion
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back, trying to get back to you
No matter what I do
It's like running under water
Trying to get back
Trying to get back to you
Wheels turn so slow
Trying to get back
Trying to get back to you"
"She says, you know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up from out of the sand
And ties his shoelace that read ""superman""
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
She says, I know what you're goin' through
As she talks to the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it's been broken in two
But baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said, it's okay to cry
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
He's forty-five and his job is gone
Cleans out his desk and heads on home
Sees his kids out playin' in the yard
Been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says, honey look at me
We all fall down
It's the getting' back up that really counts
We live and we learn
To help someone up when it's their turn
In life there's only one guarantee
Your feet won't always be on the ground
'Cause we all fall down
We all fall down
But you gotta get back up"
"Don't get yourself hit by the fear
Don't set yourself up for the fear
Fear is an opening
Causes an actual tear
Don't buy yourself into the fear
Don't let yourself fall for the fear
Love is the spectacles
Turning the murkiness clear
Fear is a rock in your stomach
Fear is a weight in your heart
Fear is unorganized
Love is the old engineer
Fear it perpetuates heartache
And love is the only relief
Love is the carpenter
Love is the old engineer"
"Darling, I have come to tell you
Though it almost breaks my heart
But before the morning darling
We'll be many miles apart
Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When she's in my arms asleep
Can't you hear the night birds crying
Far across the deep blue sea
While of others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes think of me
One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darling you have broke my heart"
"I dreamt of a suit a suit so fine I dressed my words in
Sewn and tailor made with song in mind made of melody
Stitched by threads of notes with perfect pitch, perfectly composed
Sound in tune and key, a code of rhythm, and harmony
But when I awoke my coat was worn and my words were plain
Each song that I sang all the notes were wrong and poorly played
Both my sleeves had holes, my knees were patched, my shoes needed soles
No clever disguise no way to hide my offensive tone
But I, I wish for you more than I can give, than I can do
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tune
Yeah you, you deserve the best an anthem not my hand-me-down tune"
"I heard you've been wondering
How I'm getting along
I guess you think I can't make it with you gone
But I don't want you to worry
Don't you lose any sleep
But a man called long-distance this morning
Said they're thinking about putting me
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
I don't sleep in the nighttime
Darkness reminds me of you
I lost eight pounds since last Tuesday
But I could stand to lose a few
I don't believe I'm too bad
People say I look fine
The man from the paper seems happy
Says I'm bigger than the latest crime
On the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today
So if you're concerned in trouble
Then you're hurting me
Don't you work out this little thing called losing you
Has made a big man out of me
I'm on the cover of the USA Today
The story of heart-breaking pain
Picture of the loneliest man they claim in the USA Today"
"Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've been so alone
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks, down a long, dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light
Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
And if you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way the back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong"
"Given up on traveling'
It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train
Now a mind can wonder and that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be
I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say
About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong
But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
Somewhere I slipped off track
I was thinking I could fly
But there never was a train
That couldn't try"
"When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
He's just asking for trouble for a one way love won't never do
He can't see the forest for the trees he can't hear the wind blow for the breeze
He can't see the rainbow for the blue
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you"
"Lonely lake in Minnesota
Dying tree in Ashtabula
Rains came in yesterday
Fleeting hearts are here to stay
Sometimes I change my mind
Sometimes I think it's fine
Crying boy in Baton Rouge
Troubled men in this town too
Passing strangers touch my sleeve
All I do is think of me
Sometimes I change my mind
Sometimes I think it's fine
Burning house in tupelo
Devil's fire from down below
Politician sang to me
Someday girl we'll all be free
Sometimes I change my mind
Sometimes I think it's fine"
"Bring your heart home, quit your wandering
Don't you get tired of living alone
I'll be waiting if you ever change your mind
And bring your heart home
Bring your heart home, break the change loose
Restless chains on your suckled mind
I still love you and you're welcome love still lives here
Bring your heart home
Bring your heart home, break the change loose
Restless chains on your suckled mind
I still love you and you're welcome love still lives here
Bring your heart home"
"When life gets you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna stick your head in the sand?
Are you gonna turn and run just like that?
Are you gonna take a fall or a stand today?
When hearts break you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna pitch a fight and cry?
Are you gonna beg the reasons why?
Are you gonna say and do what's wrong or right?
Well you could always love me
Yeah you can always love me
Yeah you could always love me
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
When I let you down
What you gonna do?
x2
Are you gonna slip away in the night?
Are you gonna hold the babies tight?
Are you gonna give me more of your maybes and mights?
Well you can always love me
You could always love me x2
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
You could always love me
And if it don't feel right
At least you tried
But did you try?"
"I traded a heart full of love for a handful of kisses
That you were just throwing away
I traded a lifetime of dream for a few carefree moments
That you felt like wasting that day
If I had known you didn't care I wouldn't be so blue
Cause I'd have left my heart at home and played the game like you
I'm hoping that you had your fun cause that handful of kisses
Has broken my trusting heart in two
I gave you a love that was true for a heart that was fickle
I wish I had known at the time
You had me fooled for a while cause I thought that you meant it
When you said that you would be mine
But now that we have said goodbye I see the light of day
I had a moment of happiness but what a price to pay
I traded a heart full of love for a handful of kisses
That you were just throwing away"
"That's all this old world needs that's all this old world needs
A little more love and sweet devotion a little less hate and wild commotion
That's all this world needs
That's all this old world needs that's all this old world needs
A little more truth and no more lies and only rain fallin' from the skies
That's all this world needs
A little less envy a little less greed a little more lookin' to your brother's need
A little more laughter a little more song
In a world where people know right from wrong
That's all this old world needs that's all this old world needs
The innocence of children everywhere the peacefulness of an evening prayer
That's all this world needs
A little less envy a little less greed a little more lookin' to your brother's need
A little more laughter a little more song
In a world where people know right from wrong
That's all this old world needs that's all this old world needs
A little more love and sweet devotion a little less hate and wild commotion
That's all this world needs
That's all this old world needs that's all this old world needs
The innocence of children everywhere the peacefulness of an evening prayer
That's all this world needs"
"(Dolly Parton)
Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't hear the music for the pain
I see such happiness for some, but not for me
With love, I always try so hard to get it right
I find it gone just when I think I might
Regretfully I see it last for some, but not for me
Out of reach of all the things I want to have and hold
I've come to just accept that's how it goes
I've come so close
Not for me, it's not for me to question, I suppose
But I keep wonderin' what the future holds
Why must it be?
That life's so sweet for some, but not for me
Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't see the sunshine for the pain
But I see such happiness for some, but not for me
For me it rains, there's only pain
It's not for me"

"That ol' sun comes up every mornin'
And goes back down at the end of every day
It's just that way
Stars show up every evenin'
Man in the moon comes out to play
It's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
The ocean wet the desert dry
Don't ask me why, 'cause I can't say
It's just that way
As sure as the world keeps turnin'
My love for you will never change
Oh, it's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
And girl, lovin' you
Is something I was born to do
It's just that way
That ol' sun comes up every mornin',
It's just that way"
"She goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drive away her memory but each night it comes back to torture me
Cause once again there she is right on time
When she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind tearing out a little each time
Her footsteps are getting louder all the time when she goes walking through my mind
I've tried to drown my thoughts in the wine
But a glass full of heartaches all I found
Cause once again there she is right on time and she goes walking through my mind
She goes walking through my mind"
"Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat sure is cold today
Here I am walkin' down 66 wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleepin' under a table in a roadside park why a man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did sleeping in my king size bed
Is anybody going to San Antone or Phoenix Arizona
Anyplace is all right as long as I can forget I've ever known her
[ steel - guitar ]
Wind whippin' down the neck of my shirt like I ain't got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain than what I've been fighting' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US Mail people writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back but I'll still be just as gone
Is anybody going to San Antone...
Is anybody going to San Antone..."
"My Donegal Shore
Oh I know its not right reminiscing tonight
Of days that are gone and returning no more
For the girl I dream of has another mans love
Far Far away on a Donegal Shore
But why should I care for She is happier ore there
She may have children she may be wealthy or poor
But I cant help my dreams Of what might have been
If I stayed at home on my Donegal Shore
Now its winter time there all the trees will be bare
And The rain clouds will darken my native theadore
But if that girl I could hold Every rain drop would be gold
It would fall all around us on my Donegal Shore
Now theres no one to blame But before she took his name
She told me she loved me and it hurt to the core
But I could never descend to be only her friend
So I left her there on my Donegal shore
Now its winter time there all the trees will be bare
And The rain clouds will darken my native theadore
But if that girl I could hold Every rain drop would be gold
It would fall all around us on my Donegal Shore
But if that girl I could hold Every rain drop would be gold
It would fall all around us on my Donegal Shore"
"Come on Christmas
Please take me away
Keep me hidden safe
'Til January's second day
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
I'll wrap myself up in the cheer
That's so abundant
This time of year
Come on Christmas
Come on Noel
Even though it's just September
I can forget to remember
All the empty nights
Still in my way
Come on Christmas
Embrace me with some joy
'Til the last few lonely moments
Of this year have been destroyed
Come on Christmas

"Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me, so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best.
I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister, or Cuervo Gold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.
Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.
No, I wasn't cheatin'. She just said that I was hard to please.
And I'll admit it: I can be set in my country ways.
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.
Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.
You've got beer from all over the world on the wall.
I can even get a free t-shirt, if I try them all.
But tonight I'm in the mood for some of that home-grown brew!
Yeah, pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, hey I know what the best is.
Anything domestic, light, and cold!"

But you and I know I'll just have to come back
Yes I know that you know that I love you as sure as the stars shine above you
You don't have a care and I don't have a prayer
And I know that you know that I care
I'd come when you call like a good little clown

Yes I know that you know...

"Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car drivin' dude with a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breezes blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of no where a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in
Some beach
Somewhere
There's no where to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing we'll give you some Novocaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
Then he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evenin' air
On some beach
Somewhere
On some beach, somewhere"
"He'll never wear a business suit
Cowboy hats and bull hide boots just suit him fine
See that buckle shine
He won it in a rodeo
On a horse named Desperado
And he won the ride but he broke his back
Hit so hard he heard it crack
No more rodeo
But you can't keep a good man down
A line of western wear uptown heard of his fame
And they bought his name
Now he looks down from a suite
At the silver limo parked out on the street
And he's not just a face in a martini crowd
He drinks long neck Bud and gets a little loud
The mans back on his feet
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
In a business world so fast
On a horse of a different color
But hell hang on til the last
He's still the local hero
He's the hometown pride and joy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
A woman loved him through it all
Through his rowdy days and his hardest fall when he almost died
She stayed by his side
She's still right there today
He wouldn't have it any other way
And he never did get too proud
To hang out with the same old crowd
Were proud to say
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
In a business world so fast
Oh but its a different saddle
Than he once rode in the past
He's still the local hero
He's the hometown pride and joy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy
He's an uptown down-home good ol boy"
"I was setting up for a gig
In this little country bar
This old boy in the corner watched me
Tune up my guitar
He said, ""What kinda music do you play hoss?
I play some myself""
He said, ""I sure hope it's country
These days it's hard for me to tell""
You can talk to me about tractors
Cowboy boots and pickup trucks
Ol' cane poles and dirt roads
And spittin' Skoal in a Dixie cup
You can tell me about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
He said, Country is a way of life
That's almost gone
It's more than the clothes you wear
Or how you sing a song
It's about being honest
And working hard
Looking someone in the eye
Being who you say you are
You can talk to me about tractors
Cowboy boots and pickup trucks
Ol' cane poles and dirt roads
And spittin' Skoal in a Dixie cup
You can tell me all about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
You can tell me all about your Grandpa
And how he turned you onto Hank
But if you gotta tell me how country you are
You probably ain't
If you gotta tell me how country you are
You know what, you probably ain't hoss"
"Oh hard is the fortune of all womankind
They're always controlled, they're always confined
Controlled by their parents until they are wives
Then slaves to their husbands the rest of their lives
I am a poor girl, my fortune is sad
I've always been courted by the wagoner's lad
He's courted me daily, by night and by day
And now he is loaded and going away
Your parents don't like me because I am poor
They say I'm not worthy of entering your door
I work for my living, my money's my own
And if they don't like me they can leave me alone
Your horses are hungry, go feed them some hay
Come sit down beside me as long as you may
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
So fare thee well darling, I'll be on my way"
"Last night I had the exact same dream as you
I killed a bird to save your life
And you gave me your shoes
You said clip my wings and walk my miles
And I said I would too
Then I woke up but I wasn't gonna tell you
Today I sang the same damn tune as you
It was lady in red I hate that song
And I know you do too
You didn't catch me singin' along
But I always sing with you
Nice and quietly cuz I don't want to stop you
I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I see the world the exact same way that you do
We lend our hands and take our stance
In tandem when we do
But I lied and said I knew the way
I hid my eyes from you
I still don't know why I probably didn't want to scare you
I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
But time and too much don't belong together like we do
If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I'm gonna die the exact same day as you
On the Golden Gate Bridge I'll hold you hand
And howl at the moon
Scrape the sky with tired eyes
And I will come find you
And I ain't scare cuz I'm never gonna miss you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you
I belong to you now
I belong to you"
"Three feet tall, five years old
Starin' down to the bottom of Mountain Top road,
Hands wrapped tight around those plastic handle grips
I took off flying pickin' up speed
The world was a blur of rocks and weeds
It was all worth the pain of landing
Getting my first three stitches
Everyone said that I shouldn't do it
Cut and bruised but I got through it
I still got the scars to prove it
Life's like a big wheel keeps on turning
Time runs away, every day I'm learning
To roll with the punches, follow my hunches
Loving the way it feels
Just to be alive
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel
I'm takin my share of dead end curves
Had to steady my nerves and steal my courage
Had a lot of hard landings but I ain't hanging up my wings
Yeah I'm still rippin' down that hill
Still hanging on with all my will
Lookin' back now I still
Wouldn't change a thing
I've had a few lovers leave their mark
I've broken my pride and I've broken my heart
But I'm gonna live my life before it all goes dark
(Repeat Chorus)
On the big wheel
Just to be alive
Getting the chance to ride on the big wheel
On the big wheel
On the big wheel
I'm still learning to ride on the big wheel
I'm still learning to ride on the big wheel
On the big wheel"
"Well, I was lookin' for just a little bit more
Than just another pretty face
Someone who would be strong and true
If trouble ever came my way
Too many times, I've been left behind
When my back was up against the wall
But now I found someone who ain't gonna run
No matter how the dice may fall
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough, she's tough
Well, she's soft and sweet and she's good to me
Even when times are bad
She picks me up with a gentle touch
Anytime I'm feelin' sad
Don't you know I'll never let her go
'Cause she makes it so plain to see
When love is real, it's strong as steel
And hers is all I'll ever need
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough, she's tough
And I'm so glad that I'm her man
'Cause when the you know what starts to hit the fan
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down
She's tough enough to steady me
When I'm walkin' on shaky ground
When it comes to tenderness
Buddy, that's when she's at her best
When the goin' gets rough
She's tough enough to stand by me
When it all comes tumblin' down"
"Just like the sun over the mountain top you know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time like sunlight dancing on your skin
And I have never gone so long just for telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing that I can hide a few you see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now till I gain control again
Just like a lighthouse you must stand alone and mark the sailors journey's end
And no matter what sea that I've been sailing on I'll always roll this way again
Out on the road that lies"
"There's no such thing
As tears or heartache
There's no such thing
As lonely or blue
There's no such thing
As any memory about us
There's no such thing
As me and you
There's no such thing
As it turning out badly
There's no such thing
As hopes and dreams gone bust
There's no such thing
As this all ending sadly
'Cause where we are concerned
There is no such thing as love
You never wanted
To be kissed or told
That I never wanted
Another to hold
We never laughed
We never cried
If that's not the truth
It's just better to lie
You never wanted
To be kissed or told
That I never wanted
Another to hold
We never laughed
We never cried
If that's not the truth
It's just better to lie
'Cause there's no such thing
As any trouble forgetting
And there's no such thing
As deceit or mistrust
Yeah, there's no such thing
As remorse or regretting
'Cause where we're concerned
There is no such thing as love
Where we're concerned
There is no such thing as love"
"(C.W. McCall, B. Fries, C. Davis)
Did you see me at Westport Landing
On the wide Missouri shore?
Did you hear the west wind calling
In the spring of forty-four?
[Chorus]
If the mud don't stay and the cattle don't stray
We can make Fort Kearny by the middle of May
If the mud don't stay and the cattle don't stray
We can make Fort Kearny by the middle of May
Did you see me at old Fort Kearny?
Did you hear my trumpets blow?
Did you write your name in stone, boys
On the great Platte River road?
[Chorus]
If the wolf don't howl in the dark of the moon
We can make Scotts Bluff by the middle of June
If the wolf don't howl in the dark of the moon
We can make Scotts Bluff by the middle of June
Did you see that endless prairie
Blowin' clean and pure and free?
Did you hear that rollin' thunder
On the wild Nebraska sea?
Did you climb the shining mountains?
Did you cross that Great Divide?
Did you pray to God Almighty
To let you down the other side?
[Chorus, but only by C.W.]
Roll wagons, rollin' rollin'
Roll wagons, rollin' home
Roll wagons, rollin' rollin'
Roll wagons, rollin' home
Did you see me out on the desert?
Did you see my oxen die?
Did you find a drop of water?
Did you hear my children cry?
[Chorus]
If the sun don't shine and the river don't rise
We can make South Pass by the fourth of July
If the sun don't shine and the river don't rise
We can make South Pass by the fourth of July
Did you see the high Sierra
Far beyond the burning sand?
Did you find that golden valley?
Did you reach the Promised Land?
[Chorus]
If the snow don't fly and the river don't dry
We can make that valley before we die
If the snow don't fly and the river don't dry
We can make that valley before we die"
"Out into the moonlight
I could never fail
Down by the turkey creek
To find that old trail
The river she's a flowin'
I'm rememberin' the night
Before I knew she was goin'
She was clean outta sight
Chrorus
That muddy water keeps on rollin'
Like the buffalo, she keeps movin' on
From that bayou town my heart was stolen
Like the water rollin' out with the tide
She was here and gone
There ain't no magic in the moonlight
No feelin' in the wind
But I know the stars are just as bright
Somewhere around the bend
She takes a bit of everthin'
Just which ever way she flows
Now a thought is all she brings
And that's the way it goes"
"Letra de Lover Du Jour -
""Lover Du Jour""
What are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good
Cause I know your kind
If you wanna be mine
We gotta get this understood
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
If you think I will be, I'll be your lover du jour
I'm what? (Lover du jour) Not me!
I am well aware of your good looks and se*y ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready just having it your way
Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight (Lover du jour)
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't need one place to order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
Oubliez-moi! Forget me!
Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merit from you!
That's crap!
If you want something appetizing
Something real and satisfying
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way!
Cause, I'm not gonna be your, be your l'amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your lover du jour
No, I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble
You are a bad bad boy! (l'amour du jour)
I am a tasty starter around a full course meal
Desert half after dinner drink, and you can have no feel...
Pardon my French ...
Any questions?
Ugh, my French is awful but my love is awesome
They gonna laugh at me in France, sorry..."
"Trees are for climbin
And holes are for diggin in
Friends are for when youre havin fun
And hearts are for when you want to love someone
Dogs are for huggin
And cats are for puttin up with
Birds are just lookin at
And heads are for when you have to wear a hat
Dads are for bein with
And doin things, and helpin Mom out
And Moms are for talkin to
And telling things that you cant tell anyone
Ears are for hearin your father call
And eyes are for seein when its dark
Legs are for when you have to run
And hearts are for when you want to love someone
Brothers always take your things
And they break your things, and eat your candy
And sisters always tell on you
And they cry a lot when they got no reason to
Feet are for puttin your shoes on
And hair is for lookin nice in school
And hands are for foldin when your book is done
And hearts are for when you want to love someone"
"Long ago when but a boy at old camp meetin' time
How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Callin' all the saints of God into the house of prayer
Oh such prayin' singin' shoutin' for the Lord was there
How I like the old time preachin' prayin' shoutin' singin'
How I like the old time readin' of God's words
How I like to hear that glory hallelujah singin'
How I like the old time worship of the Lord
[ guitar ]
How I like the old time...
[ guitar ]
Preachin' in them good ole days was still the world acclaim
Preachin' for the souls of men and not for wordly fame
Under such old fashion preachin' sinners knelt and pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way
How I like the old time..."
"Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah
That's it man
Okay baby, yeah
Aha
Play it on
Aah, good song
Yeah"
"Sometimes in the mornings I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy and I tell myself it's been a little long
To still be expecting you to call me up on the phone
I don't like holding on but I can't let go
Sometimes a photograph of you will take my breath away
I don't think that time's a healer no matter what folks say
How can years fly by so fast and breaks in a heart mend so slow
I don't like holding on but I can't let go
Sometimes I'm in a room full of people when old lonely sits by me
And it makes me sad to realize that unlike you he won't ever leave
I wish I had some kind of pill to take this feeling from my bones
I don't like holding on but I can't let go"
"Don't accuse me of being without feelings if you do you know that you're wrong
For it was you who was careless and you drove me into another's arms
The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important I feel wanted again I can't give up the other woman in my life
[ steel ]
I'm like a float in the middle of a river I can't climb out on either side
And if I go over the deep end it's because sweetheart you haven't tried
The other woman isn't prettier..."
"So long we've been married
Life's burdens we carried
Though they kept us humble and made our love true
The plans that we make up
Someone seems to break up
Oh, darlin', what else can we do?
[Chorus]
We may have to leave here
To find peace of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life all our own
For I know you love me, and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone
While I go out walkin'
There's of loose talkin'
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But, darlin', it's not true
Because I still love you
And I do with all my heart
[Chorus]
They say that you're leavin'
That you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them they're wrong
That loose talk will do harm
And hope that the truth they will see
[Chorus]"
"I don't care what anybody thinks of me
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knee
I only know I need you and I love you so
And I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow I'd turn my back on everyone I know
I'd do these things with no fear of tomorrow
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go
Yes I've heard 'em talkin' about my lovin' you the way I do
And they're sayin' things like nobody should love anybody as much as I love you
But I don't care if the world stops and the sun explodes or the moon turns to ashes
I'd gladly stand and fight the world before I'd let you go
I'd gladly beg I'd steal...
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go"
"Go on with your new love have a good good time
Take her out and show her off fill her tall glass with wine
Live all you can I'll forgive you when the last thrill is gone
Just remember your sweet love is waiting at home
Bright lights had you blinded for a long long time
Your rose colored world is a long way from mine
I'm just a teardrop from a breakdown and so all alone
Take your time when you wake up won't you please come on home
Come on home come on home never more to roam
I'll open wide my arms of love it's all right so come on home
I'll open wide my arms of love it's all right so come on home"
"Eyes that shine with love for me caring not for fame's prestige
Asking not what I can give that's a portrait of my woman
Loving hands caress my cheek understanding when I'm weak
Courage when the need is there that's a portrait of my woman
Arms that reach and seem to know when I need to be held close
Caring when her cares I need that's a portrait of my woman
Faith in me that gives me strenght pouring love for me to drink
Sharing life with a smile that's a portrait of my woman
I've stumbled with the dreams and fell and her dreams were shattered
She kissed my lips and said my love was all that really mattered
So I'll try everyday to hand her love's happy bouquet
She means more than life to me that's a portrait of my woman"
"It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I hear the voice my sweet momma called me
Telling me to change my ways
In my mind, I smell the dogwood blooming
Takes me back to yesterday
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I left behind the person that I once was
I changed for good and some for bad
I've wasted days and nights on love forgotten
I've traded happiness for sad
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the hurt of a broken heart inside me
I've felt the joy of love unchained
I've seen the rain wash away a mountain
Like tears have washed away my pain
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've watched some loved ones dear to my heart dying
I've heard a newborn baby's cry
I've walked a path of glory and of darkness
I've felt the guilt of a senseless life
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
Drank to forget and I've drank to remember
And I've drank for love and I've drank for hate
I've danced alone with a full moon up above me
Lighting the way to heaven's gate
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home
I've felt the love of Jesus shining on me
I've felt the devil's wicked ways
Prayed for forgiveness, prayed for redemption
Prayed just to make it through the day
It's a long, hard road I'm traveling on
Seems forever I've been gone
Yeah, it's a long hard road I'm traveling on
Lord I need to find my way back home"
"Sometimes I catch myself staring at you while you're lying fast asleep
I memorize the moment and lock it away
In my heart somewhere where it'll keep
Sometimes I still tremble when you brush against my skin
Where your hand reaches out to touch my face
I've never known anyone like you before
And I know I'll never see the likes of you again
No one in this world could ever take your place
And in case you don't know it this is a love song
And it comes from the heart of someone who loves you so
I don't always show it so this is a love song
You are loved I just wanted you to know
And in the quiet times when you talk to me
I hang on to every word that you say
You might not always see my love but it's always there
You still take my breath away"
"What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
'Cause everybody has already tried
Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family is gonna want you to stay
You know what I don't blame 'em
So I'll say
What I don't want to
And I'll just pray
You want what I do
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I've blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way?
Could you love me anyway?
Aww, could you love me anyway?
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl if that's what this is
I don't want to let it slip away
No, no, no
Could you love me anyway?
Please
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway? Oh
Could you love me anyway?"
"If you need your car towed,
If that Volkswagen breaks down on the way out of this town
I know a guy
I'll make a few calls,
If you need something part time
'Til you're back on your feet
I know a guy

Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
If you would ask me to think of a person that didn't deserve you
I know a guy
And if you needed a man to never really listen
Not know what he'd be missing
I know a guy
If you're looking for someone barely hanging on,
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
Yeah I know a guy
Who feels like a fool,
He's been hating himself for what he put you through
He'd take it all back if he only knew how
He knows that you've probably moved on by now
But if you're looking for someone barely hanging on,
Lost the only thing that he ever loved
Wishing you would come over
Give anything just to hold ya
If you're trying to find a man who lost his mind,
Doesn't sleep at night unless he's dreaming about you laying right here beside him
Praying someday you might feel like forgiving
And think about giving him one more try
Then I know a guy
One, one more try
I know a guy"
"It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up, brushes her long blond hair
And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight""
We go to a party, everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady walking around with me
And then she asks me, ""Do you feel all right?""
I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
You just don't realize how much I love you
It's time to go home now, I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys, she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
""Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight"""
"All my traveling time
Running circles around my dreams
Waking up to find
Our love's not what it seems
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Well there's no use following the heartache
That leads me back to you, I'll
[Chorus]
Wait for the way
Through the valley of my shadow of doubt
Through the winter of my discontent
And when it seems like all my hope is spent
There's only one prayer I pray...wait for the way
Each small step of my life
There's a loneliness I've known
I take the road that's right
Even if I'm left alone
But I know that heaven holds amazing grace
When you trust what you feel inside
And a true heart opens at it's own pace
And I must say goodbye, and
[Chorus]
Now my soul keeps calling for a long lost day
And a love that I held so true
Though there's no use falling for the heartache
That leads me back to you, I'll

"He said there's no future back here in these hills
His mind grew so restless he couldn't be still
Though I knew I might lose him and all I dreamed of
Still I send my baby to Chicago with love
Big city don't hurt him don't change him I pray
Keep him the same sweet boy as when he went away
He'll never know how often I pray to God above
To send down his blessings to Chicago with love
Well I just got his first letter he's got a job and things are looking fine
He keeps sorry he didn't write me before but he just didn't have a time
He says I've got a lotta new friends now honey the Chicago sure is a swingin' place
And by the way I just got married
And I'll be bringin' in home with me one of these days
Big city don't hurt him"
"I gotta turn you away so I can keep this hope alive
You're tapping on the window but I won't let you inside
Maybe you'll give up and find somebody else tonight
I draw the curtains say a prayer and turn out the light
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend
I used to let you crawl right in make yourself at home
You'd burrow underneath my skin and wrap around my bones
But you've worn out your welcome so just walk on past this house
You ain't getting in here and I ain't coming out
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger
Not a friend

I'm finally feeling strong
(I ain't going down again)
But I ain't made of stone

Leave me alone
I ain't going down again
Sorrow get away from my door
Don't come around
Don't come around
Don't come around here
No more
I won't welcome you in
From now on you're a stranger

"Why on why do we go on this way
Playing games that lovers always play
It's so sad and you're so glad
Maybe I can find a way today
I try so hard to give you what you want
But that's not good enough
All I want is satisfaction
All I get's a cool reaction
Think I'll play another game today
Think I'll change my face
I will be just what you want to make me
But you will see me just like any other
I try so hard to give you what you want
But that's not good enough
All I want is satisfaction
All I get's a cool reaction
Lovers look before you leap
Take good care to land on your feet
Don't waste time with someone else's heart
You know you'll always end up hurting someone
Why try so hard to give him what he wants
When he's not good enough
All I want is satisfaction
All I get's a cool reaction"
"(Rock of ages cleft for me)
There's a family Bible on the table its pages torn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table will ever be my key to memory
Cause at the end of day when work was over and when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table when from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
Now this old world of ours is full of trouble but this old world would also better be
If it had more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me rock of agesrock of ages cleft for me"
"Quand je marche dans la rue
La rue vers le Sacr?-C?ur
Je me souviens des promesses
Au nom de l'amour
Je, je vais t'attendre l?
Viendras-tu pour moi?
Je vais t'attendre l?
Seulement toi
Tu peux me tenir
Jusqu'? ce que le soleil se cache
Et embrasse-moi doucement
Jusqu'? ce qu'il revienne
Je vais t'attendre l?
Viendras-tu pour moi?
Je vais t'attendre l?
Seulement toi
Tu prends peut-?tre du retard
Tu as peut-?tre rat? ton train
Tu ne peux peut-?tre pas me pardonner
Les ombres grandissent
Et les foules s'effacent
Je, je vais t'attendre l?
Viendras-tu pour moi?
Je vais t'attendre l?
Seulement toi
Seulement toi"
"There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
And it comes in black and it comes in white
And I'm frightened by those that don't see it
When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesn't change by the man that's elected
If you're loved by someone, you're never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon you that's flooded in light
And in the fine print
They tell you what's wrong and what's right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it"
"Since first I saw the love light
In your eyes
I thought the world
Held not but joy for me
And even though
We've drifted far apart
I never dream
But what I dreamed of you
I love you
As I never loved before
Since first I saw you on the village green
Come to me
Or my dream of love is all
I love you
As I loved you
When you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen
Since first I saw the love light
In your eyes
I thought the world
Held not but joy for me
And even though
We've drifted far apart
I never dream
But what I dreamed of you
I love you
As I never loved before
Since first I saw you on the village green
Come to me
Or my dream of love is all
I love you
As I loved you
When you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen"
"If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you
Another night for me is just beginning soon the wine will wash away all my shame
With every drink one more mem'ry will leave me come closing time I won't feel a thing
Here I am on my way to the bottom it's a shame the things a man will do
If I could climb the walls of this bottle oh darlin' I'd come home to you
It's been a long long time and I miss you but this world I'm living in won't let me go
And it's too late to say that I'm sorry and why I left you for this God only knows
If I could climb the walls of this bottle"
"The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway
When I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying, daddy don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some
'Cause you're making me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
It broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run to catch a train
She had no way of knowing
I was leaving home for good
I turned around and there was again
Crying, daddy don't you walk so fast
If only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some
'Cause you're making me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast"
"Every friend has got a friend in mind
'Cause I've had more than a little time
So it's on your mark, get ready, set
But I know my heart's not ready yet
I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you
She don't have to look just like you
No her eyes don't have to be that blue
It's hard to give someone a chance
When you can't get past that second dance
I can walk into a room without you
And I don't get drunk and talk about you
So I guess I've learned to live without you
I just don't know how to love without you
Sometimes the pain is dulled to numb
And I can't believe how far I've come
I can walk into a room without you
(I can breathe without you)
And I, I don't get drunk and talk about you no more, no more
(And I can sleep without you)
So I, I guess I've learned to live without you
(I can be without, I can be without you)
I just don't know how to love without you
(I don't know how, I don't know how)
See, see I, I had to learn to live without you
(I had to learn to live without you)
Oh but I just don't know how to, how to love, how to love without you
(Oh I just don't know, how to love, how to love without you)
Every friend has got a friend in mind
'Cause I've had more than a little time"
"Born to lose I've lived my life in vain every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear how I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone it's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness all I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue born to lose and now I'm losing you"
"Tennessee raised Alabama bound
If the girl leave me gonna move from town
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
Where were you when the train left town
I was standing on the corner with head hung down
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
Rations on the table and the coffee's gettin' cold
Some old rambler stole my jelly roll
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
I was going to the depot
See that girl, won't you bring her back
She got her fingers in my money sack
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
Ain't that the train that carried my girl from town
If I had her number Lord I'd sure flag it down
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train, hey, hey, hey, hey
Won't you here that whistle blowin'
I wish to the Lord that train would wreck
Kill the engineer, break the fireman's neck
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
See that train Lord I'd run down the track
Call? with my girl? back
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train carried my girl from town
Oh it gone with her now
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Show me a woman that a boy can trust
Hey, Lord ain't that passing train that carried my girl from town
Oh it's gone, almost gone"
"Well I get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
I go crazy inside while you were gone
Yes I get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
I don't think I could take it very long
There would be so many little teardrops fall I don't think that I could count them all
And I know a heart could never ache like mine if I couldn't love you all the time
Cause I get lonely in a hurry...
[ guitar ]
If you ever took your love away from me I'd die
I don't think that I might live in memories
And for sure I know that I would lose my mind
If I couldn't love you all the time
Cause I get lonely in a hurry...
I don't think I could take it very long"
"If you really want me to I'll go it's not that I want to but I'll go
If you know somebody who could love you more than me
If you really want me to I'll go
I don't know just what you're tryin' to do I only know my love for you is true
Don't tell me that it's over don't tell me that we're through
If you'll leave I don't know what I'll do
I need you more than you know ask me to do anything but go
I can hardly talk afraid I'll cry just don't think that I can say goodbye
Don't tell me that it's over don't tell me that we're through
If you'll leave I don't know what I'll do
[ ac.guitar ]
I need you more than you know...
Don't tell me that it's over..."
"Whenever I chance to meet some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home
Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'...
Kiss an angel good mornin'..."
"I think Ive stayed too long, but I aint glad to go
Back past the front door, theres someone sad and low
I climb into my office, I'm pulling away fast
Such a fool I forgot it, that drive could be my last
Driving far, on a distant road
Where we are, it's so hard to know
Say it for me, you'll be there for me
And you're gonna stay
When I'm days away
My comatose conscience, now it's clear and loud
Vince Gill on that radio, hes killing me now
If I could change the way I left, lord knows I would
I hate that not too long ago, I knew where I stood
Driving far, its a distant road
And where we are, sometimes I dont know
Say it for me, you'll be there for me
And you're gonna stay
When I'm days away
Im just days away"
"Come on baby it's a quarter to five
I've been living on the couch and I'm losing my mind
I haven't gotten a touch in a long, long time
Since Friday XIII part nine, going to hell
Thumbing through all the magazines
And I can drink a lot better than I could in my teens
Have we learned nothing but to kick and scream?
We're as civilized as we could have ever dreamed and what's that mean?
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
The kind of attraction I couldn't leave
Keep watching the static on TV
Might be as well but not as bad
When your silence shows of our public failure
I woke up in the middle of the night
Sheets soaked, still drunk, terrified
Something tells me you're not alive
The pulse keeps getting softer
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Come on, baby
You've got something to lose
I'll buy you new clothes
I'll buy you new shoes
All kinds of things that we could really use
But all I need is you
I need you girl, you got that heart and soul
We've been living in the dark and digging our holes
But all that we need's right under our nose
Boy, don't you think I know?
I guess so
Come on baby won't you feel alright?
It feels like forever since I've been warm at night
So let's get back to what all that was fair and just
Oh won't you please love me again?
Please love me again"
"Writers: Doug Supernaw/Kenny King
I just called to say hello, I hope everything's alright
Me, I'm doin' fine, but I still can't sleep at night
I finally had a good day just last week
At least the best one since you've gone
But it kills me when I hear, ""When's Mamma comin' home?""
Chorus:
And I know that there are somethings
You feel that you've been missing
I tried to be your Superman
I've done all I can
Still you feel the need to spread your wings
But darlin' if you're listening
When the world ain't all you thought it would be
You still got me
I live everyday a lie and tell the kids that it's alright
And I see alot of you in them when I tuck'em in at night
Try hard not to be too weak, for one of us must be strong
And it kills me when I'm there lyin' all alone"
"Only you can make this world seem right
Only you, only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you
Only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true my one and only you
Only you, only you can make this change in me
For it's true you are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true my one and only you"
"Oh the pain of loving you oh the mis'ry I go through
Never knowing what to do oh the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you but I'll never understand
Oh the pain of loving you...
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
To love and hate at the same time the line between the two is fine
But too has bound me heart and soul so strong that I can't let you go
Oh the pain of loving you...
Oh the pain of loving you"
"I go all to pieces at the sight of of you
I tried to look the other way when you're around
But that takes more strenght than can be found
I just get weak as memories pass through
I go all to pieces at the sight of you
You've hurt me so many times that I've lost track
Yet given half a chance I take you back
You're the master of my life and there's nothing I can do
I go all to pieces at the sight of you
How could anyone control me so completely
And make me do the crazy things I do
Little things like forgiving you for being so untrue
I go all to pieces at the sight of you
[ steel ]
How could anyone...
I go all to pieces at the sight of you"
"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream"
"I'm waiting on the green light to make you mine
But your heart's just taking its own sweet time
You want to be sure if you'll sink or swim
Well grab ahold of me and just jump on in
You're playing it safe
But baby I'll wait
[Chorus]
Oh, whenever you're ready
I could be yours in a second or so
Oh, baby come and get me
My heart's sittin' on go
Ooh, it's off to the races
All you've gotta do is let me know
Oh, I'm ready and waiting
My heart's sittin' on go
You oughta give in now instead of resisting
'Cause I'm not above a little arm twisting
I'm bettin' it's only a matter of time
Before you and me are standing at the finish line
You're having your doubts
But you'll come around
[Chorus]
You're playing it safe
But baby I'll wait
[Chorus]
My heart's sittin' on go
My heart's sittin' on go"
"You put your best red dress on
And came here tonight all alone
He must have really hurt you bad
Ordered up a double coke and rum
And hope it'll turn into fun
He must have really hurt you bad
I don't know your story but it ain't hard to see
You've a heart that's broken as a heart can be
It's probably not like you at all
To mix loneliness and alcohol
He must have really hurt you bad
Now it's 1 a.m. and here you are
With some stranger at the bar
He must have really hurt you bad
Across town in some motel room
He'll try to heal your past
While the one that's lying next o you is only there for laughs
He must have really hurt you bad
Now I'm the Joe that sets you up then cuts you off
And calls a cab when you need me to
And I'd like to say that only once in a while
I see someone goin' what you're goin' through
Well, I need the tips, but I'll be alright
If I don't see you tomorrow night
Stay home girl
He must have really hurt you bad"
"I hate love,
what's it ever done for me,
but cause me a lot of grief,
lost me a lot of sleep
Every time I say I've had enough,
I'm never doing that again,
I wind up falling right back in.
I hate love.
I hate love,
It's nothing but a losing game
Never worth the price you pay
You find out every time you play
When you think
You're finally wising up,
It shows up in a new disguise,
And hits you right between the eyes,
I hate love.
[Chorus]
Into each life some rain must fall
But it feels like I've got more than I deserve
When the sun comes out and shines on me
Somehow I always wind up getting burned
[Chorus]
Into each life some rain must fall
But it feels like I've got more than I deserve
When the sun comes out and shines on me
Somehow I always wind up getting burned
I hate love
Cause every time I'm not in it
I try but I can't forget
Just how good it is
Here I go again.
I've been hit by the bug
There's really nothing I can do,
But fall in love with you
I hate love."
"What a time to turn your back on someone
What a day to be without a friend
What a shame when no-one seems to bother
Who will offer shelter to candles in the wind
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be
And it's said that life is like a ladder
Just a dream we're reaching for the stars
Can't you see how little really matters
We are only searching for what we really are
And it follows we are only helpless children
Ever changing like sunlight through the trees
It's a long road we must cling to one another
Help yourselves to each other, that's the way it's meant to be"
"I ALMOST LOST MY MIND
Writer Ivory Joe Hunter
When I lost my baby (baby) I almost lost my mind When I lost my baby (baby) I almost lost my mind My head is in a spin since she's left me behind I went to see the gypsy And had my fortune read I went to see the gypsy And had my fortune read I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said Well, I can tell you, people (people) The news was not so good Well, I can tell you, people (people) The news was not so good She said ""Your baby's left you"" ""This time she's gone for good"" (gone for good)"
"She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to turn
She'd forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to learn
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
Or anything crampin' your style
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?
Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own?
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
And that's why she kept hangin' on?
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscience
She did all she could for a while
Then she picked up the pieces and she started livin'
Now don't she look good when she smiles?
Don't she look good in the new dress I bought her?
And the new way that she wears her hair?
She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody cares
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could change so in this little while
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?
Oh, don't she look great in the new dress I bought her?
And don't she look good when she smiles?"
"I followed you to Texas I followed you to Utah
We didn't find it there so we moved on
I followed you to Alabama things look good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there so we moved on
I know you're tired of following my elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams
I had your child in Memphis you heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska to a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there so we moved on
Now we've left Alaska because there was no gold mine
But this time only two of us moved on
And now all we have is each other and a little memory that we could to cling to
But still you won't let me go on alone
I know you're tired of following my elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams"
"Play me a sad song
Tell me your woman's gone
You know how misery loves company
Sing it just one more time
Before I lose my mind
Tell me how misery loves company
Loneliness surrounds me
Emptiness you found me
I don't think I can go on
Sing me a drinking song
Tell me you done her wrong
You know how misery loves company
I'll put in my last dime
To hear it one more time
Willie sing Misery Loves Company
Loneliness surrounds me
Emptiness you found me
I don't think I can go on
I don't think I can go on
I don't think I can go on"
"My oh my, time sure flies
I like what you've done to your hair
I've been fine, yeh these boys are mine
That must be your little girl there
Some friendships grow distant with time
And it's no wonder, Emily, so much can change
We're too far to visit, too busy to write
But a closeness between us remains
Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
Emily, we'll always be friends
I still sing now and then
Mostly at weddings for friends
And I just bet you still get
A yearning to paint now and then
They tore down our whole street
Now there's a bank where the house was we shared back in school
Remember we both have each other to thank
For all the boyfriends we're not married to
""Stay as you are and you'll go far""
You signed my yearbook
""Don't forget me when you're a big star""
We can't stay, it's gettin' late
And they said not to let you get tired
We'll just be up the street
The number's right here by your side
Oh no, it's no trouble
I don't want to hear about how all this changes my plans
I'll see you tomorrow
Call me tonight, Emmy, please let me do what I can
Best friends are made through smiles and tears
And sometimes that fades over miles and years
But I knew right away when I saw you again
Emily, we'll always be friends"
"There was a time when we'd be the last to leave
Watching the sun come up as everyone failed to see
The music was always loud and I'd smoke and drink too much
Till I fell into your arms into your loving touch
Now as the years roll by time has reeled me in
Slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then
Those old ways of mine I left them behind
Those crazy days are through
The only thing I still do like I use to do
Is carry this torch for you
Do you remember when we packed our bags and run
Chasing some crazy dream into the morning sun
Now as the twilight falls I find I'm satisfied
Watching the fire glow just as long as you're by my side
You're in my heart it seems time has passed me by
I love you as much today if very first time
Those old ways of mine I left them behind
Those crazy days are through
The only thing I still do like I use to do
Is carry this torch for you"
"Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me
Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?
Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, wouldn't that be great?
In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of what a man he was
In the name of love, in the name of love
Love went away when the sexy lace wouldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be good? And I know
You could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? And you know you should
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?"
"I wasn't fooling around
Everything's true that I said
So take me seriously
Darling, please just take me
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feel
I wasn't playing around
I'm not a kid anymore
I'm not the clown
That's just here to amuse you
I wasn't fooling around
Laugh if you want to
But I wasn't joking
About this love that's so real
Is it surprising
I'm romanticizing
About the way I feel"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland."
"[Chorus:]
Godspeed your souls return
Deep from these waters
Straight to the angels arms
Beyond the sea
How sweet the days gone by
How sharp the corners
How blue the canvas sky
That set you free
[Bridge:]
And oh somehow i know we're not apart
For i still hold your love inside my heart
How soft this light of grace
Shines through my sorrow
From some amazing place
You reach for me
Repeat [Bridge:]
Repeat [Chorus:]"
"I won't forget the day I found
My first place on the edge of town
A few milk crates, a beat-up couch and an old T.V.
A little rundown, a little bit small
But to me it was the Taj Mahal
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
Friday night, what the hell, let's go
And just like that we were on a roll
Three best friends and a radio, that was all we'd need
We put a thousand miles on an old red jeep
Just to watch the sun rise on the beach
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
I left home around 22
Mama was beggin' me to finish school
But there was nothing they could do, it was up to me
So I packed my bags and an old guitar
'Cause if you're ever gonna be a star
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
So grow your hair, get a new tattoo
Quit your job and go to Bonnaroo
Whatever it is you wanna do
Or think or be
Don't put it off too many years
'Cause some of the best stuff disappears
I ain't old enough to know but I believe
Yeah, there's some things you gotta be young to see"
"(Billy Dean)
I came home from college to see my old man
He was sittin' on the porch swing, with a book in his hand
He stared at my earring, and at my tattoo
He smiled and shook his head and said
It's good to see you
He chose his words carefully cause it was hard for me to come
And he knew I had ta temper and where I got it from
I waited for the sermon, the one I knew so well
But this time he wasn't preachin'
About heaven or hell
He said a real man knows the value of a woman
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Could it be that I saw just a glimpse of his soul
Or maybe losin' Mama had just taken it's toll
He gave me his Bible, stained with tears he had cried
And I opened up the cover
Where he wrote inside
And it said
A real man has got nothin to prove
He's strenthened by love
And the Lord up above
So do the best that you can
To be a real man
Do the best that you can
To be a real man"
"Leave me a lock of your golden hair leave a memory that we once shared
Leave me the twinkle in your eye leave me something to remember you by
Leave me a kiss as you walk out the door
For you know and I know you won't be back no more
Leave me a way as you say goodbye leave me something to remember you by
[ steel ]
Leave me a kiss...
Leave me something to remember you by"
"That's not what i said but if that's what you heard
Then you didn't hear one single word
We're so far apart, something is missing
It makes it hard when no one is listening
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Not long ago, there was a time
We were so close that you read my mind
Now things that we say end up being hurtful
Lately it seems we go 'round in circles
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Let's lay down our gloves, pay attention to love
It doesn't matter who's right
Or who's wrong
If we don't change baby it just keeps going on and on
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said"
"I love you so much it hurts me darling that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night afraid of losing you
I love you so much it hurts me and there's nothing I can do
I wanna hold you my dear forever and ever I love you so much it hurts me so
(I love you so much it hurts)
I love you so much it hurts me so"
"Girl I can tell that you're thinking of leaving
But it'll hurt me so much you don't want me to know
You've done all you can to hide what you're feeling
Oh, but one part of you, it let's your feelings show
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie
So I say what's wrong and darlin' you just say it's nothin'
I can almost believe it hun when I hold you like this
But I know in my heart that there's no tomorrow
So just for tonight hun I'll pretend that there is
Oh, your fingertips tell me you'll stay
And your warm red lips say you won't go away
And your lovin' arms make me think you're still mine
Whoa girl, if only your eyes could lie"
"I know the sun will rise tomorrow morning
When morning comes I know it brings the dew
I know a storm can come without a warning but I don't know why I keep loving you
I know that you can't help these things you're doing
Oh you don't mean to hurt me yet you do
I know if this keeps on you'll be my ruin but I don't know why I keep loving you
I keep waiting for the change that never seems to come
The change that will make you love me too
But I know from your past there'll be no changing I don't know why I keep loving you
I don't know why I keep loving you"
"He was a tall man
Raised up from the fields, out pickin' cotton
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten
But when he saw her
All those bad times were forgotten
And he believed, he believed
She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin' for one man
To love the way that her mama'd taught her
And when she saw him
She thanked God for what he'd brought her she believed, she believed
And it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe, I believe
It's a sad thing
When one must leave the other
And fly up where the voice rings
Out with all the multitudes that gather
But for a short while
Down here no song ever sounded sweeter
And we believed, we believed
For it's a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday they'll walk again together
I believe, I believe
This I believe, I believe"
"I'm cracked for you
My soul has been twisted
I'm cracked for you
My heart has been blistered
I just want to forget
And lead a peaceful existence
I just want to forget
There are riches to be found in ignorance
You gave up love
You say you have to resist it
You gave up God
I saw the evidence in the pictures
I just want to forget
And lead a peaceful existence
I just want to forget
There are riches to be found in ignorance
I'm cracked for you
My fog has been lifted
I'm cracked for you
My continents have drifted
I just want to forget
And lead a peaceful existence
I just want to forget
There are riches to be found in ignorance
When we lay front to back
How instantly familiar
It's just the way I am
I've already seen, already been
Cracked for you
My soul has been twisted
I'm cracked for you
My heart has been blistered
I just want to forget
I just want to forget
There are riches to be found in ignorance"
"It's a sad day in Floyd County, Mr. Jones
Yeah, the grief is strong for the man that's gone
And at the grave his woman cries and she moans
'Cause it's a sad day in Floyd County, Mr. Jones
The six children he raised are all weepin'
For this soft-spoken mountain man
Who fed them with the money he earned in those black mines
And the food he could raise with his hands
Chorus
Though the world knew nothing of his wisdom
Or the honest and simple things he did
There's some folks cryin' on this hillside today
That know about the humble way he lived
Chorus
Now this house in the holler stands empty
Though his presence in my memory is plain
You know that I'd swear that I just saw him walkin' up that hill
I guess this place just won't never be the same
Chorus"
"When you just walk by me ever so casually oh how I long to be just your woman
Just a brush of your lips and my heart just jumps and skips
At your slight fingertips I'm your woman
And if you ever take me in your arms real tight
For a moment I'll feel wrong to be feeling so right
And if you ever kiss me a hungry goodnight I'll be too weak to fight I'm your woman
Like a rose in full bloom sending out sweet perfume
I know you're in the room without looking
I've been wildly upset since the moment we met you won't let me forget I'm a woman
And if you ever take me"
"Here we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
Settling now once again
What was begun will meet it's end
Running now, time to hide
Go inside, it's time to hide
Here we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
Waiting now, dull roots twinning
Keeping watch for new roots shining
Here we stand at the end of paths taken
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, we're still lost
There you stand at the edge of salvation
Guiding light inspiration, the slow decline
The crumbling foundation, the stations and now the cross
But we're still lost, yeah, we're still lost
But we're still lost, we're still lost
But we're still lost, yeah, we're still lost
But we're still lost, we're still lost"
"Blue and gold behind me in the bleachers
Go Comanches on makeshift cardboard signs
We Will Rock You blaring through the hometown speakers
As I flew from the pyramid
In the last game of my life
A string of taillights on a dark and dusty dirt road
Bon fire burning back a Tommy Collars farm
Jakes leather jacket kept me from getting too cold
I was wrapped up in the moment
Wrapped up in his arms
::Chorus::
I wont forget
Seeing our breath
How warm it felt
Out in that freezing weather
The fire on his lips
Chills on my skin
Loving him turned to embers
Ill forever remember
That November
Heater cranked in his daddys Silverado
Little detour up on Cedar Hollow Ridge
I drew our names inside a heart on a foggy window
My daddy would have killed us both
If he knew what we did
:chorus:
The fire on his lips
Chills on my skin
Ill forever remember
That November"

"Love built the house that I am livin' in livin' in livin' in
Well love built the house that I am livin' in and I'm happy in my house of love
Well happy little birds are singin' in my house of love
Joy to every heart they're bringin' in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh every day the sun shines brighter in my house of love
Every day my heart is lighter in my house of love
Love built the house...
Oh clouds have found with silver linin' in my house of love
Every day the sun keeps shinin' in my house of love
Love built the house...
One more time now love built the house...
I'm so happy in my house of love yes I'm happy in my house of love"
"I know the heartaches are coming cause I know you're going away
There's no gladness in your voice when you say darling
There's no love behind your lips when they touch mine
There's no feeling in your arms when they're around me
How much, could you say it's goodbye time
I know the heartaches are coming I know the sky will turn gray
I know the the tears will start falling cause I know you're going away
Arms that were friends now are strangers eyes that could see now are blind
Only tomorrows of sorrow from the day that you leave me behind
I know the heartaches are coming"
"Roll along, roll on rose of cimarron
Dusty days are gone rose of cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see who's standing
Waiting at your window
Watching will they ever show
Can you hear them calling
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark now
Never see a spark burn bright
Trails that got them home
Kept the names they've known
Four days high and lonely
Coming to you only"
"(Steve Rhymer/Elizabeth Rhymer)
Hail, hail to the newborn king
Let our voices sing him our praises
Hail, hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our savior
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Ale, alleluia, alle, alleluia
Come now, there it shines so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Lean close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and the thankful"
"EVERY WORD I WRITE
WRITERS GEORGE RICHEY, ROGER BOWLING, JAN CRUTCHFIELD
I've been sitting here alone all night
Thinking 'bout things that I'm gonna write
When you read this goodbye note you'll know I've had enough
But it should come at no surprise to you
Knowing you treat me the way you do
You've made lovin' too hard and living too rough
I just need a good place to start
To say what I really feel in my heart
And what I'm gonna write to you is long overdue
And don't expect me to change my mind
Or try to read something between the lines
Make no mistake about it baby, we're through
But every word I write comes out I love you
I just want to say it's over no matter how I try
Every word I write comes out I love you
Guess I've loved you much too long to say goodbye"
"I just don't like this kind of livin'
I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
I give my all and sit and yearn
And get no lovin' in return
And I just don't like this kind of livin'
Why do we stay together
If we always fuss and fight?
You ain't never done to be wrong
And I ain't never been right
Tell me where you think we're goin'
Cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
When things go wrong you go your way
You leave me here to pay and pay
And I just don't like this kind of livin'
I just don't like the things you're doin'
Your evil heart will be your ruin
When things start running smooth and free
You haul right off and you pick on me
And I just don't like this way of livin'
They say the road of love is long
It's rocky and it's rough
But if this road don't start to get smooth
I've traveled it long enough
Why don't you act a little bit older
And get that chip off of your shoulder
Well I told you once now I'll tell you twice
You better start to treatin' me nice
Cause I just don't like this kind of livin'"
"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it be--me"
"Well she rolls her own cigarettes with the work of just on hand
She acts mean and she cusses I know she wish she were a man
She got her teeth knocked out by a bucking horse
And when I told her that It made her look tough
She just grinned and said I like it that way
And then she loaded up her lip with snuff
She's my snoose queen she's my Copenhagen angel
She's my Beech Nut bunny she's my Red Fox brush hog
She can ride a bareback horse and she can really hook into a bull
She never misses her saddle bronc out and she rides it like a spurrin' fool
She team ropes with the best of them ties a calf in 9.3
She'll dogs steers just for fun and make a fool out of you and me
She's my snoose queen...
Oh well a buckle polisher she's dang sure not
She wins her own in all the tough spots
Chasing cowboys just ain't her style. It's winnin' the prize money that makes her smile
She's got a plug in both her cheeks she's got Copenhagen in her lip
She's got a roll-your-own stuck between her teeth and I've never even seen her spit
She's my snoose queen..."
"When we get home babe gonna light your fire
All day I been thinkin' about you baby you're my desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you and hold you close to me
Oh babe I wanna taste your lips I wanna feel your fantasy
I don't know what I'd do babe without you I don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover no you're everything to me
Every time I'm with you baby I can't believe it's true
When you're lyin' in my arms and you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing just let me show how much
I love you I need you yeah I wanna kiss you all over and over again
I wanna kiss you all over till the night closes in till the night closes in
No one else could ever make me feel the way you do
Oh keep on lovin' me baby and I'll keep lovin' you
It's easy to see when somethin's right or somethin's wrong
Oh stay with me baby and hold me all night long
Show me show me everything you do
Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you I need you yeah I wanna kiss you all over and over again
I wanna kiss you all over till the night closes in till the night closes in
Stay with me lay with me holdin' me lovin' me baby
Here with me near with me feelin' you close to me baby"
"(Wait, let me get the sweat off my fingers)
You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Still, it's fun watching you beg
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
I know why you cheat on me
(Always running 'round and 'round)
Every time I turn my back
(You'll never change)
Every woman loves a bit differently
(But hurts the same)
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trapped"
"Hold on until the feelin' is so strong
Until the ground that you walk on
Is where you stand.
This dream, it heals and it haunts me
It's tempted and taught me who I am
This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out.
Some will burn bright.
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town.
In this town.
Strangers, we're nothin' but strangers
When our heart's in danger
For the song we sing.
I've seen the devil inside me
But I won't let him guide me
Or take my wings
This town ain't yours
And this town ain't mine.
We all come here with a light in our eyes
Some will burn out. (Some will burn out.)
Some will burn bright. (Some will burn bright.)
Some learn to fly.
Some will run for their lives.
In this town
In this town"
"(Dolly Parton)
Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no
Yodel-a-he-ho
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua"
"The mix tape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby

"She's the queen of the red-hot mamas, hottest thing around
And she shows up at a honky-tonk 'cause she can right just lay it down
Ya know she get on down, on down to the ground
She's the cat's meow and a dog's bow-wow, hottest thang in town
Friend of a friend of a friend of mine said he knew her well
Said she hung around heaven till she learned too much
Then she headed straight for hell, she went straight to hell
Everything for sale
She walks the walk and talks the talk, hottest thang in town
She's the hottest thing in town by a country mile
She can lick her lips and roll her hips and really make you smile
She's got everybody's number, she's making all the rounds
She's a hell of a heavenly ball of fire, hottest thang in town
Someday I'll get lucky and slide into her town
Maybe if she sees me, we'll go round and round and round
We'll go round and round, burn the whole town down
We'll be the red-hot dame and her lady's clown, hottest thang in town"
"Ask the sky above and ask the earth below
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear just why did I'm yours
When you went away you left a glowing spark
Trying to be gay as whistling in the dark
I am only what you make me come take me I'm yours
How happy I would be to beg and borrow a sorrow with you
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through
If we'd drift apart then I'll be lost alone
Though you use my heart just for a stepping stone
How can I help dreaming of you I love you I'm yours
If we'd drift apart
Hm I'm yours"
"You don't love me this I know
Don't need a bible to tell me so
I hung around a little too long
I was good but now I'm gone
Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
Any way the wind can blow
That's where I'm gonna go
I'll be gone like a five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know
The shoulder I've been leanin' on
Is the coldest place I've ever known
There's nothin' left for me round here
Looks like it's time to disappear
Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
The old wall down in Jericho
Maybelle on the radio
I'll be gone like the five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know
You don't love me, this I know
Don't need a bible to tell me so
It's a shame and it's a sin
Everything I coulda been to you
Your last chance Texaco
Your sweetheart of the rodeo
A Juliet to your romeo
The border you cross into Mexico
I'll never understand why or how
Oh but baby its too late now
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he oughta know"
"Just to hurt me just to see me sit and cry
Just to know that you brought teardrops to my eyes
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
And just because you know I love you oh so true
Guess you know that I settle down to be a fool
Just to hurt me that's all you ever do
My life has no meaning when you're not here
And though you don't need me I know that you're near
Oh makes no difference I just hang around and try
Though you say things that break my heart inside
Just to hurt me mhm that's all you ever do
Yes just to hurt me that's all you ever do"
"Papa won't you let me go to town with you

I shined it and I shined it till it looks all brand spankin' new
Seems like a year I've been waiting for today
If you let me go I won't get in your way
Papa won't you let me go to town with you
Papa I'm feeling so down and blue
You just gotta come around, please do
Papa won't you let me go to town with you"
"How many days
How many ways
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
How many nights
How many lonely nights
Do I have to lose you darlin'
'Til you're gone?
It happens every time
I think I'm gettin' over you
Something 'bout somebody new
Gets me thinkin' about you
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
I see you on the Late Show
I hear you on the radio
Darlin' everywhere I go
Your memory is there
How many times
How many times
Do I have to lose you
'Til you're gone?
(How many times?) I wanna know
(How many times?)
Do I have to lose you Darlin'...'til you're gone?
(How many times?)
How many days.....how many nights.....'til you're gone?
(How many times?) I wanna know
(How many times?) I wanna know Darlin'"
"I remember how we struggled when we first started out
She recalls, we had it all, not what we did without
I think back on those hard times, she remembers only love
Well, who am I to say, that's not exactly how it was?
That's how she remembers it, she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?
You ought to hear her tell the kids how mom and daddy met
It always amazes me, the things that she forgets
Somehow she gets it turned around but it's still my favorite part
How mommy looked in daddy?s eyes and I stole away her heart
That's how she remembers it, she was the lucky one
Just take a look at both of us and you tell me who won
If she thinks I hung the stars, if that's what she believes
Then who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?
If I made her dreams come true as far as she can see
Who am I to tamper with her perfect memory?"
"Storms never last do they baby
Bad times will pass with the winds
Your hand in mine steals the thunder
You make the sun want to shine
Oh, I followed you down so many roads baby
I picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And ever road we took God knows our search was for the truth
And the storm brewing now won't be the last
Storms never last do they baby
Bad times will pass with the winds
Your hand in mine steals the thunder
You make the sun want to shine
Storms never last do they baby
Bad times will pass with the winds
Your hand in mine steals the thunder
You make the sun want to shine
Storms never last do they baby"
"Give me a ticket for an airplane cause I ain't got a time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I got to spend cause I got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone I'm a going home my baby just wrote me a letter
Well he wrote me a letter said he couldn't live without me no more
Hey listen Mister can't you see I've got to get back to my baby once more
Give me a ticket for an airplane...
Well he wrote me a letter...
My baby just wrote me a letter my baby just wrote me a letter"
"We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're OK
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then
I wanna feel that way again
Been so long that you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire, so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and didn't just sleep
Remind me baby remind me
Oh so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby remind me
I wanna feel that way
Yeah I wanna hold you close
Oh if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
Oh baby remind me, remind me
Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me, yeah remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me, oh baby remind me yeah
Oh baby remind me baby remind me
Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
Oh, baby remind me"
"You can say you love me
And I'll believe that's true
Trusting you is easy
'cause I believe in you
There is nothing I would miss
As long as we're in love like this
[Chorus]
All I have is all I need
And it all comes down to you and me
How far away this world becomes
In the harbor of each others arms
I feel like I've known you forever and ever
Baby that's how close we are
Right here with you is where my life has come together
And where love has filled my heart
You know I'd go anywhere
As long as I have you to care
[Chorus]
Ooh-and with the love you bring
I never want for anything
I found what I've been searching for in you
[Chorus]"
"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Though, it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you"
"Sundogs barkin', barkin' round my dreams
Three ring circus rockin' round the sun
The taste of fire and Julia's name
Right there on the tip of my tongue
I was on the mountain
And the sun was goin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia
I kissed her on the mouth, I looked her in the eye
I's actin' half my age and feelin' way too proud
I drove into the desert, I drove up to the sky
I parked it and I left it just a hangin' on a cloud
I was on the mountain
The first star was shinin' down
All I's wishin' for was Julia
Night wind blows
Stars above the blue
Heaven knows
Only love will do
Now what's a few miles between the beauty and the beast
What's it mean when angels keep flying by above
Storm clouds gatherin' round the full moon in the east
I was empty-headed but my heart was full of love
I was on the mountain
Lightnin' all around
All I's lookin' for was Julia
The more you need her help the more she let's you down
The more you like the way she walks the more she shakes her hips
The more you fall in love with life the more she runs around
The more you fear the kiss of death the more she licks her lips
I was on the mountain
There was thunder rumblin' down
All I's listenin' for was JUlia
Night wind blows
Stars above the blue
Heaven knows
Only love will do
I was on the mountain
I was never comin' down
All I's thinkin' bout was Julia
All I's thinkin' bout was Julia"
"Yesterday tomorrow seemed a million years away
But here it is just twenty four hours later and I find that I still miss someone
I said I could despise her by the dawn of another day
But there's the sun and I don't hate her even after everything she's done
I convince myself I'd get her off my mind
A good night sleep and things would be all right
But I woke up this morning and now I realize that I can't forget her over night
I've tried to make myself believe that I'm much better off
I've told myself she's nothing special and I still find that she's the only one
And if I'd live a million years I know I'd never change
I'd take her back and I'd forgive her even after everything she's done
Even after everything she's done even after everything she's done"
"Hang on, just hang on for a minute
I've got something to say
I'm not asking you to move on or forget it
But these are better days
To be wrong all along and admit is not amazing grace
But to be loved like a song you remember
Even when you've changed
Tell me did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you see, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, that wasn't me
When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust
And you'll hide from your god like he never turns his back on us
And you'll fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife
And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life
Tell me did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you see, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, that wasn't me"
"Tranquei a porta do meu peito
Depois joguei a chave fora
E bem depressa eu mandei
A solid?o embora
E nem dei o primeiro passo
J? dei de cara com voc?
Me olhando com aquele jeito
Que s? voc? tem
Quando quer me vencer
Dona das minhas vontades
Com a chave da paix?o
Tranquilamente vai e volta

"I've been thinkin about the things she said
How I'm dealing with deep, dark stuff
I've been facing the voices in my head
Rising up when the road gets rough
Haven't I seen enough?
Chasin' this dream called love
Seeing how it all adds up
You'd think that I'd know better
No other has every filled me up
I've been living a life of liberty
I've been leaving a trail of tears
I've been trapsing around this great wide world
Sadly singing this song for years
Haven't I seen enough?
Chasin' this dream called love
Seeing how it all adds up
You'd think that I'd know better
No other has every filled me up
So many loves
So many broken promises
I knew I couldn't keep
So many nights
Facing the loneliness that haunts me in my sleep
This longing to be free
I've been thinkin about the things she said
How I'm dealing with deep, dark stuff
I've been facing the voices in my head
I'm getting ready to rise above
Cause haven't I seen enough?
Chasin' this dream called love
Seeing how it all adds up
You'd think that I'd know better
No other has every filled me up
You'd think that I'd know better
No other will ever fill me up
And haven't I seen enough?"
"(Ron Agnew)
The cowboy will never get married to you, girl
It's the fightin' that he just can't bear
But when there's women and whisky and beer-drinkin' brawls
The cowboy will always be there
He'll sing you sad songs, girl, 'cause that's all he knows
And soon you'll be listenin' to
Solutions to problems you don't even have
As he unloads his wisdoms on you
He'll have you believin' he's one-of-a-kind
And that his kind knows what livin's for
He's a dreamer by nature, a liar, and soon
He'll have you believin' he's more
He'll say he's a loner, to cover the truth
Some sympathy might see him through
Just a hand on his shoulder and a bottle of that booze
Then all he'll be needin' is you
He'll drink all your whisky, to clear out his head
Of the drinkin' he's already known
And with a little persuasion, he'll lie in your bed
And when you wake up, you're alone
Now you're feelin' sorry, and the cowboy is gone
He just a-has ta be a-movin' along
But honey when you get lonesome, turn your radio on
And the cowboy will sing you a song"
"You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing then do something else
And even though I know that all too well
I keep forgiving
I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
Love doesn't come with any guarantee
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
An you give me back a stack of I.O.U.'s
There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do"
"Well,Hope is an anchor, and love is a ship
time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're goin' 'til you know where you're at
and if you can't read the stars, well you better have a map
a compass and a conscience soul so you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonley island where no one wants to be
From the begining of creation I think our maker had a plan,
for us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
and let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind,
to the beaches in the world where we have never been
and we'll climb up on the mountain y'all and we'll let our voices ring
those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing
oh my my
First Chorus:
so i'll see you on the other side, if I make it
it might be a long hard ride
but im gonna take it
sometimes it seems that i dont have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go where the streets are gold
cause you'll be there
oh my my
Well you don't take nothing with you here
and you can't take nothing back
I ain't ever seen a hearse with a luggage rack
so i've torn my knees up praying, scarred my back from falling down
I've spent so much time flying high til i'm face first in the ground
so if you're up there watching me, would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand to see you both someday
oh my my
Second Chorus:
So i'll see you on the other side, if i make it
and it might be a long, hard ride, but i wanna take it
sometimes it seems that i don't have a prayer
let the weather take me anywhere
but i know that i wanna go where the streets are gold
'cause you'll be there
oh my my
cause you'll be there
oh my my"
"You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You're runnin' and tryin' and tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse; he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding ya down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again 'cause I been where ya been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe that you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart; it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight
You better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life"
"The news is out all over town that you've been seen a running round
I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
[ strings ]
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again"
"You say you love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, green grass beneath my feet
Running through the fields of daisies, wading through the creek
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine, I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance, a picture show and the joy that a bluebird brings
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the morning that make each day a joy to see
The nighttime brings a peaceful feeling that rests inside of me
I love you please believe me, I won't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
But I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine
Oh, oh I was raised on country sunshine
Mmm, mmm I was raised on country sunshine"
"I don't just love you I live you where I'm concerned nothing comes before you
If I had ten lifetimes every one I'd give you
No I don't just love you no I don't just love you I live you
Every moment with you makes a memory
When I stumble you're the reason I don't fall
My life is what you make it and you make it beautiful
Words can describe you but love said it all
Cause I don't just love you..."
"I got a job in a factory
Feeding a beast that don't like me
It don't give a darn about how I feel
As long as I feed it its ration of steel
And pity the man who knows the grief
That comes with the bite of that monster's teeth
Pity the man who knows the grief
That comes with the bite of that monster's teeth
Watch your mitts at the start of the stroke
It's a re-peat killer, and will go for broke
It shoulda been melted 'bout twenty years back
But it feeds the boss and he loves that snack
Oh, Beast, spare my hands
I'll use them to slay you if I get the chance
Oh, Beast, spare my hands
I'll use them to slay you if I get the chance
There ain't no guards to slow up a man
Keep your foot on the pedal and your eye on the ram
If your hand should slip, why the boss don't shout
He just buys new fingers as he throws you out
There's plenty of hands to feed the jaws
The press don't stop when there ain't no cause
There's plenty of hands to feed the jaws
The press don't stop when there ain't no cause
There ain't one man out on the press
Who wouldn't quit if jobs weren't scarce
But a man has to have his daily meal
And that Beast's gotta have its cold rolled steel
Deep inside remain the dreams
That make us the masters of the machines
While deep inside remain the dreams
That make us the masters of the machines
Well, now, I got a job in a factory
Feeding a beast that don't like me
It don't give a darn about how I feel
As long as I feed it its ration of steel
Long as I feed it its ration of steel"
"She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows to love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
I love her till the day I die
In my dreams I can see you, darling
In a gingham dress you look so neat
I long to feel your arms around me
And to kiss your lips so sweet
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
Gonna love her till the day I die
Since I left you in old Kentucky
I've missed your love and need you so
But from now on we're gonna be together
From your lovin' arms I'll never go
Yes, she's my rose of old Kentucky
I watch her bloom as the years roll by
And I know there'll never be another
Gonna love her till the day I die"
"Till death do us part is what you promised
Richer and poorer, through thick and thin
But vows are only vows to one who's honest
And being true to yourself, you've never been
(Chorus:)
Cuz you lie
How can I believe a single word you say
Cuz you lie
They should put you in a liars hall of fame
(Steel/guitar/fiddle solos)
You said you'd be at your mothers with the baby
But when I called your mother said you never showed
When I asked you about it you got mad and called me crazy
That's ok I don't think I really want to know."
"In your letter you said please don't try to find me
I'm leaving cause you're choking me to death
Your love is like a chain that ties and binds me
And I'm goin' off somewhere to get my breath
I didn't mean to come on strong believe me I've just always loved you in a hungry way
And now to think that's causing you to leave me
I'm so confused and hurt by what you say
If I loved you too much I'm sorry if I loved you too much and make you go
If I loved you too much forgive me but I loved you in the only way I know
[ steel + piano ]
If I loved you too much I'm sorry if I loved you too much and made you sad
If I loved you too much forgive me but you were all I had"
"My feet feel like two stones
I walk this road alone
Ain't got no way to know
Where I'm supposed to go
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me
I tore the whole thing down
Watched it as it hit the ground
It didn't even make a sound
I wish I could turn it around
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me
Oh fortune teller can't you tell me
A little bit of what I will be
Fortune teller what do you see
Lately nothing's coming easy
I lost my crystal ball
Found me a wrecking ball
I lost my crystal ball
It ain't hard to see
It's made a wreck of me"
"Time of day I can't recall
The kind of thing that takes it's toll
Over years and over time
Over smiles and over wine
All in all it wasn't bad
All in all it wasn't good
But I still care
That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say
What it is you never said
All the books you never read
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody will pick me up
And carry me again
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride and joy
I believe this to be true
Nothing sacred nothing new
No one tells you when its time
There are no warnings only signs
And you know that you're alone
You're not a child anymore
But you're still scared
All your mountains turn to rocks
All your oceans turn to drops
They are nothing like you thought
Can't be something you are not
Life is not a looking glass
Don't get tangled in your past
Like I am learning not to
Where are you now
Do you let me down
Do you make me grieve for you
Do I make you proud
Do you get me now
Am I your pride joy"
"Your world was so different from mine don't you see
We couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
My world could never fit in I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how we've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide
[ steel - piano - ac.guitar ]
Now your world was made up..."
"I was born and raised in the Red Clay Hills of Texas
In the land where the grass gets only beer can tall
That's where I learned to cuss and fight and chew Brown Mule Tobacco
Fix windmills 'fore I was five years old
I rode every head of stock from the Gulf to Kansas City
And running wild is all I've ever known
But this cowboy's got a weakness for tight Levis and yellow ribbons
And there's something 'bout 'em I can't leave alone
Tight Levis and yellow ribbons make a cowboy swim a river
That before he jumps he knows is way too wide
And they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride
I met her at a rodeo in Douglas Arizona
I'd drawn the rankest horse a man could draw
Well, I rode him tall and spurred him high and when I made the whistle
The crowd went wild but she was all I saw
That night we had a beer or two with friends of mine from Dallas
She smiled and said she loved the Texas drawl
And I felt like Roy Rogers did in all those cowboy movies
'Cause I became the hero, got the money girl and all
Tight Levis and yellow ribbons make a cowboy swim a river
That before he jumps he knows is way too wide
And they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride
Yeah, they'll make him throw a saddle on a bronc he's never seen
And one he knows he'll never break to ride"
"No worries
I don't have a single care today
Everything is gonna go my way
No worries
Don't hurry
I can love you girl the whole night long
Play guitar for you and sing my songs
No, no, no, no worries
If life brings rain, we'll grow roses
It don't matter what life throws us
I'm alright as long as I've got you, you, you, you
No worries
Let's find a boat and chase the sun
We'll smile and wave at everyone
No, no, no, no worries
So let's get lost out on the ocean
Never look back, just keep floatin'
I'm alright as long as I got you, you, you, you
No worries
I don't have a single care today
Everything is goin' to go my way
No, no, no, no worries
Don't hurry
'Cause I can love you girl the whole night long
Play guitar for you and sing my songs
No, no, no, no worries
No worries
No, no, no, no, no worries
Na, na, na, na, na, na no worries
No, no, no, no, no worries"
"Stood by the window,
watch him walked away.
Saw the wind blow his hair
thru the tears of my eyes.
No one had to tell me,
My heart know for certain.
But thru the lies and lines I've heard..
every spoken word, and in the cold hard truth.
I taste my bitter sweet waste of youth.
Tomorrow I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna make me Shine.
But tonight, I'm going to cry
for what once was mine.
I hold on for dear life
'till it comes judgement day.
True love never dies..It just walks away......
JUDGEMENT DAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
These memories surround me,
but don't make a sound.
Like thieves in the night,
They come sneak'n around.
Hear'm silently shouting,
'till I'm down on my knees.
So I'm going to lie on this floor,
In my black funeral dress and...
...Grieve for the man who held my heart in his hands.
Then tomorrow I'm going to get up and make me shine.
But tonight I'm going to cry for that hard hearted man.
No matter how hard I try, I could not live that way.
True love never dies, it just walks away....
JUDGEMENT DAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
Down for the count,
Life took the breath out of me.
The more That I cared,
The more I just wanted to be free.
So tonight I'm going to cry
for what once was mine.
I'll hold on for dear life,
til it comes... JUDGEMENT DAY....
True love never dies, It just walks away......
AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
OHHH AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY
OHHH AWAY
JUDGEMENT DAY!"
"I give him love the best I can,
But you don't seem to understand.
It's not always deep,
But it's always true and he does not belong to you.
Hey, I do not forgive, and I do not forget.
I will fight for love, until the day
Jezebel, save your charms,
He'll be back here in my arms.
Oh how quickly you forget he's not yours yet.
He is not yours, not yet.
Gonna throw on this cotton dress,
Put lilac scent on the back of my neck.
I'll walk barefoot down that mountain-side,
Straight to your door.
Girl, you can't hide.
Cause I do not forgive,
And I do not forget.
I will fight for love until the day.
Jezebel, save your charms,
He'll be back here in my arms.
Oh how quickly you forget he's not yours yet.
He is not yours, not yet.
Standing out in the pouring rain,
Calling out my lover's name.
I know he won't leave me in the cold,
Send my baby home.
Send my baby home.
Jezebel, save your charms,
He'll be back here in my arms.
Oh how quickly you forget he's not yours yet.
He is not yours, not yet."
"This title is instrumental, so there are no lyrics"
"Easy lovin', so sexy lookin',
I know from the feeling,
That it comes from the heart.
Easy lovin', Everyday's Thanksgiving,
To count all my blessings,
I wouldn't know where to start
Everytime I look you over
So real to life it seems.
Upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin',seein'is believing
Life with you is like living,
In a beautiful dream
Everytime I look you over,
So real to life it seems
Upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin', so sexy lookin',
Life with you is like living,
In a beautiful dream."
"Soft as the voice of an angel
Breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers a comforting word.
Wait, 'till the darkness is over
Wait, 'till the tempest is done
Hope, for the sunshine tomorrow
After the darkness is gone.
Whispering hope,
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoice.
If in the dusk of the twilight
Dimmed be the region afar
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glittering star.
Then when the night is upon us
Why should the heart sink away
When the dark midnight is over
Watch for the breaking of day.
Whispering hope,
Oh how welcome Thy voice
Making my heart
In it's sorrow rejoice"
"And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says how you feeling hon
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
There's no such thing as Doctor Suess
And Disneyland and Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask her if she'd get away
And meet me and maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin'
And she hurries down to meet me oh I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me cause she's made that way
And if that ain't lovin' me then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such think as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns"
"Give me a little old fashioned love the kind that lingers through the years
The kind that's made by God up above give me a little old fashioned love
Now you can have the girls with rosy cheeks the ones that coo like turtle dove
I just want a simple girl that's sweet so give me a little old fashioned love
[ guitar ]
Now you can have the girls that's dressed so nice
From their head down to their little feet
But if you want some real good advice the old fashioned girls just can't be beat
So give me a little old fashioned love...
[ steel ]
Now you can have the girls with wordly ways that's had a dozen so called love affair
But they'll never make me their slave I want a simple girl that's on the square
So give me a little old fashioned love..."
"I wanna leave you
I wanna lose us
I wanna give up
But I won't
I wanna miss this
I want a heartache
I wanna run away
But I won't
Do I love you
Oh, I do
And I'm going to 'til I'm gone
But if you think that I can stay in this
Same old, same old
Well, I don't
I don't
I'm gonna break things
I'm gonna cross the line
And make you wake up
'Cause you won't
I'm gonna name names,
I'm gonna call us out
I'm gonna say it
If you won't
'Cause do I love you
Oh, I do
And I'm going to 'til I'm gone
But if you think that I can stay in this
Same old, same old
Well, I don't
Oh I don't wanna fight
But I'll fight with you
If I have to, If I have to
Do I love you
Oh, I do
And I'm going to 'til I'm gone
But if you think that I can stay in this
Same old, same old
Same old, same old
Well, I don't
I don't"
"In the twilight glow I see her blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver all my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder we'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting and no blue eyes crying in the rain"
"They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
1989 Cheyenne Chevrolet
5-Speed, single cab
Bench seat, faded grey
Turned over twice, ain't too nice
But it knows how to run
Girl, I'll get you out with a bang
Like a bullet from a gun
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
Summertime sunshine, cheap sunglasses
My heart sang southern twang
Sweeter than molasses, like the
Country angel two stepping in my dance of dreams
Girl, you got a heart of gold
And you're beautiful in blue jeans
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
They say life is like a highway
You can turn into a dead end road
I ain't afraid to get stuck
I got a 4-wheel drive kinda heart
I know is tough enough to carry any load
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Good luck
They say you never know what you got until it's gone
He's gonna learn the hard way, when he finds you long gone
Gone like the wind in your hair, hands in the air
Singing, so long, good luck
Girl, I wanna set your heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway
Heart free, ride with me
I wanna be your getaway truck
I wanna be your getaway truck"
"She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She caught me runnin' around
She was dancin' in the ashes
When they caught her with them matches
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Well she's burnin' the honky tonks down
I tried but I could not put them out
Did the best to save the whiskey
But the flame's just too risky
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She couldn't stop that honky tonk sound
It was sizzlin' like a griddle
When I ran out with my fiddle
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
She's down in the jailhouse now
Said she felt no remorse
For breakin' out that torch
She's burnin' the honky tonks down
Burnin' the honky tonks down
Smoke's been a rising all over town
She's burnin' the honky tonks down"

"Well when I was a growin' up I was a pip I growed me a mustache on my lip
It wasn't very sticky mostly fuzz I thought I'd give all the girls a buzz
I got real sweet on a nellie wills I drove that country girl back in the hills
I asked her once if I could give her a peck
She said (if you can beat me to the old hay stack)
Well I beat her there and I hugged her tight I turned loose all of my dynamite
I swear my kiss was a pretty lush she smiled real big and begin to blush
(It tickles it tickles I like it but it sure feels funny) It's a ticklin' me
Well I got me a name in the neighborhood the girls all liked me I knew they would
I let it grow for a month or two just to see what I could do
There was a girl named Fanny Smith told me she didn't like to kiss
I caught her off guard and I didn't miss (I didn't know it would feel like this)
Well her eyes bugged out and her face turned white
She helped me out with all of her might
I swear it took her breath away she giggled and I heard her say
(It tickles it tickles I like it but it sure feels funny) It's a ticklin' me
Well now I guess I pert'near run 'em wild they all went crazy over my style
Said I was the best around the kissinest man they'd ever found
The good ol' days are here again I used to do it and I still can
Said a widder that I know (I guess you'll never get too old)
Well I guess I've got that ol' knowhow you ought to see me in action now
My kiss has still got that ol' zing the widder said I ain't lost a thing
(It tickles it tickles I feel just like I'm numb again) It's a ticklin' me"
"You need a man to get lost it
With a heart big enough to roam
No more fences for you to look through
With your heart caught in a strangle hold
I've got a love full of wide open spaces
I've got a big love wild and free
Room to grow as big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
Endless as the stars above
I got a big love
When two hearts make a stand together
On the solid rock of trust
They could be a million miles from each other
And still be side by side in love
I want to love you like that forever
I've got a big love wild and free
Room to grow as big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
Endless as the stars above
I got a big love
You never dreamed you could have all you ever wanted
Darling you can have it with me
I've got a big love wild and free
Room to grow as big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
Endless as the stars above
I got a big love, I got a big love"
"I got my first motorcycle when I turned sixteen
I remember my mama raisin' cane with me
She said ""Son tell me why you want to ride that thing""
She didn't know about the blond at the Dairy Queen
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I like to ride motorcycles
She likes it too
I always wore my hair just a little too long
Daddy didn't like it and he made no bones
If I'd have gotten it cut like he wanted me to
She wouldn't have had nothin' left to run her fingers through
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I like to wear my hair long
She likes it too
I remember ridin' around with my buddies back home
Listenin' to some Country on the radio
When they tried to change the station to some Rock 'n' Roll
I'd turn the Opry up just as loud as it would go
I got my own reasons why I do what I do
I like Country music
She likes it too
I like Country music
She likes it too
Now I got a big Harley
And my hair is still long
And I'm still listening to a Country song
I got my own reasons
Why I do what I do
I know what I like
She likes it too
I know what I like
She likes it too
Yeah I know what I like
And she likes it too"
"Man, I hate you found me here
With whiskey on my breath
I know I should be ashamed
So much for those twelve steps
He said ""No my son, I know you're doin' your best
For all you've been through, hey, I understand
I only came here to be your friend
You know she still asks about you
And wonders how you're doin' and where you been...""
Chorus 1:
Tell her I'm in Tampa, on the causeway
Watchin' the waves roll in
Tell her I'm in Aspen, in a cabin
Findin' myself again
Tell her that I'm happy , and I've moved on
Better than I've ever been
Just don't tell her that you saw me, drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell that I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here
It would only break her heart
If she knew the truth
See, I told her when she left
This was the last thing I would do
Tomorrow I swear I'm startin' over again
I've made it this far and I know how it ends
But she doesn't have to find out where I am
So if you see or hear from here again
Chorus 2:
Tell her I'm in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Sellin' cars five das a week
Tell her I'm in Mobile, Alabama
Gettin' back on my feet
Tell her I'm happy and I've moved on
Lookin' better than you've ever seen
Just don't tell her that you saw me, drownin' in this bottle
Tryin' to make her disappear
Tell that I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here
Tell her that I'm happy and I've moved on
But let her know that I still care
Man, tell her I'm anywhere
Anywhere but here
Tell her I'm anywhere
Anywhere, but here"
"Funny thing about a mind
Lookin' for that brighter side
It's the only way that I can find
To let my feelings hide
But every now and then
I falter back on old memories
And I'm right back in love again
And back down on my knees
And I'm finding out the hard way
There'll never be a time when I don't think about you
And I'm finding out the hard way
At least here in my mind, I won't go on without you
All the times I reminisce
I'm finally realizing this
Until it's gone it can't be missed
But I'm finding out the hard way
Sure I'm gonna make it through
The sun'll overtake the night again
Then it's out of my mind with you
And let another day back in
And for a while I'll carry on
But what you said is surely comin' true
And although it might not last that long
The times are not so few
I'm finding out the hard way"
"Blues outside my door
I don't even know if it's raining
But I've been here before
And I don't wanna be here again
Ev'ry now and then
voices on the wind
call me back to the first time
far away and clear
you can hear the tear drops
falling for the last in love.
If I let you down
All I can say is ""I'm sorry""
Now it's' all over town
So I don't want to hear it from you
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Falling for the last in love."
"I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
Maybe I've learned this time
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
[Chorus]
Someday I'll get over you
And I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
I won't let it change me, not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I'm fond this time
[Chorus]"
"They've read the scriptures, they've passed the plate
They've sung the anthem, they've passed the plate
And we're both prayin' he don't preach late
But he's gettin' amens, that's just our luck
It's eighty five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
Well it's been rainin' all week long
Woke up this mornin', dark clouds were gone
We both been raised not to miss church
But on a day like today heaven knows how much it hurts
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday
See that sunlight shinin' through that stained glass
How much longer is this gonna last
And you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat will run
I'll tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty sunday"
"It's the place and your friends that got me down
Tellin' me I should not hang around
There's a sign in the window
Tellin' me I've got to go
I see the signs everyday
In your face and in the way that you act
And it's not that that hurts my pride
But now I see the other side of you
The side that won't let down
The side that won't let go
I didn't mean for me to see
The things I see in you and me
But now I know that we can live together
The way I want to live free forever"
"Honey, if you only knew
What I've the will to do
Endure or take
All for love's sake
Baby, there'd be no denyin'
Any sacrifice that
I'm prepared to make
All for love's sake
As evidence, I offer up my heart
Begging you to use every last part
Baby, I'll stand shielding you
Any it hurt quick to pursue
Each blades embrace
All for love's sake
As evidence, I offer up my heart
Begging you to use every last part
Honey, if you only knew
What I've the will to do
Endure or take

Begging you to use every last part

For love's sake
For love's sake
For love's sake"
"Takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
So much for wishful thinking
So much for beginner's luck
It takes a lot to rock you baby
When it comes to love you're double-tough
It takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Little things that used to please you
Are all the things that I do wrong
It takes a lot to rock you baby
Tried my damnedest all night long
My baby drives a big Rolls Royce
'Cause my baby says she got no choice
My baby wears big ol' diamond rings
Cause my baby says she needs them things
Takes a lot to rock you baby
It takes a lot to make you smile
It takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
Takes a lot to make you smile
Takes a lot to rock you baby
You make me crawl the extra mile
Takes a lot to rock you baby

Walk me out in the morning dew my honey,
Walk me out in the morning dew today.
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey,
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning,
I thought I heard a baby cry this today.
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning,
You didn't hear no baby cry today.
Where have all the people gone my honey,
Where have all the people gone today.
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people,
You never see those people anyway.

"If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song,
Uh oh, Uh oh
Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and, life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but sheburies her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
As green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Oh well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny, when you're dead how people start listen'n
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn'
Send me away with the words of a love song
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them,
The sharp knife of a short life oh
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls

"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips
And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray"
"She threw her brush across the room and hung up her dress
Said I don't feel pretty, my hairs all a mess
Tucked her curls underneath a ball cap
I just my head and said with a laugh
Honey I didn't fall in love with your hair
Up or down girl I really don't care
The heart that's inside that's why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
Sometimes I wish you could see what I see
When you think you're at your worst girl you're perfect to me
In faded jeans over just my t-shirt
You're still the most beautiful girl in the world
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Brown or blond girl I really don't care
The hearts that's inside is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
Phone call came in from her doctor back home
The cancer had spread and she threw down the phone
She looked in the mirror, tears running down her cheeks
Said if it all falls out, baby what would you think?
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Hair or gone girl I really don't care
The hearts that's inside is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Up or down girl I really don't care
The hearts that's inside is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair"
"I ride an old paint I lead an old Dan
I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley ann
They feed in the coulees they water in the draw
Their tails're all matted their backs're all raw
Ride around little dogies ride around slow the fiery and snuffy are raring to go
Bill Johns had two daughters Bill Johns had a song
One went to Denver and the other went wrong
His wife she died in a poolroom fight
Still he keeps singing from morning till night
Ride around little dogies ride around then slow the fiery and snuffy are raring to go

When I die take my saddle from the wall put it on my pony lead him out of the stall
Throw my bones on his back turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best

With his little playmate outside the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
Then he saw his daddy watching too
As the men swiftly walked to the cottage door
He knew they were strangers that came from the town
Men he had never seen before
They soon went to work when he heard his daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no! he cried, Dear God don't let it be
They can't take my sweetheart away
I know dad, you don't understand
How a heart so young could conceive a plan
I'm only seven now but it's just like you say
Daddy, someday I'll be a man
The man who owns the farm where your playmates do live
He told me it'd have to be this way
For winter time has come and the work is all done
That's why they are moving today
Let us buy the farm so they can stay
And give them all the toys that dear Santa gave
And give them all my pennies in my little piggy bank
Pennies that my darlin' help me save"
"I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place (We love!)
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury or your Evinrude and fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the waters fine
Just idle on over, and toss us a line
Basstrackers, Bayliners and a party barge,
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular joes, rockin' the boat that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
Bermuda's, flip-flops and a tank top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., (That's Bob!)
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 S-P-F, (Its hot! Whoo!)
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
And pass 'em around
Basstrackers, Bayliners and a party barge,
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular joes, rockin' the boat that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
When the party's over and we're all alone
We'll be makin' waves, in a no wake zone
Basstrackers, Bayliners and a party barge,
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular joes, rockin' the boat that's us
The Redneck Yacht Club
Redneck Yacht Club
(Na, na, na)
Redneck Yacht Club
(Na, na, na)"
"Spring the jester leaps to my eyes
And with both hands full of surprise he brings
Joy and the whole world sings
But I'm still blue
-------
Summer with his lazy smile
Warms my broken heart for a while it seems
Him and his sunshine dreams
But I'm still blue
-------
CHORUS:
Happiness is only a memory
For you left me blue
Took the rest of the rainbow from me
-------
Autumn with an artist's hand
Leaves his mark all over the land with bold
Strokes of burnished gold
But I'm still blue
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
Winter comes and tightens her grip
One more year lies waiting to slip away
Like a ship on a fog bound bay
But I'm still blue
But I'm still blue"
"I want to ride again on the 3.10 to yuma
That's where I saw my love
The girl with the golden hair
Not a word between us was spoken
No the silence never was broken
But before she left her eyes said a sad goodbye
Sad am I sad am I
To think of the chance that I missed
I could cry to think of the lips left unkissed
Perhaps she'll ride again on the 3.10 to yuma
And I can meet my love and tell her how much I care
Though I have no reason to go there
And there's not a soul that I know there
When the 3.10 to yuma leaves if I have the fare
I'll be there I'll be there I'll be there"
"Every time our worlds meet I start crying
All my heart strings grow tied than common wound
Cause I know you'll go back to the dark side will my love ever turn you world around
When they'd lock all the doors to the taverns
And the law runs your old friends out of town
You can cry your regrets on my shoulder maybe then I can turn your world around
If my love could be turned into silver I'd just buy out your world and give you mine
Then return your poor heart through the good things
Well to you love's not just a frame of mind
When they'd lock all the doors
I pray that then I can turn your world around"
"Let's just take our time
There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night
Wasting it with you
The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to win
Stay here by my side
We'll watch the struggle start again
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
Until you
The city's settled down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration
For every breath you breathe
Now this all makes sense
With you as company
I left all I knew and found
The better part of me
Yeah yeah
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
The time it took to find you
I would wait again, my baby
For the feelings that I feel with you now
I need you
Now and forever
To stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept
From me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you
Until you
Until you
Until you"
"Don't you look pretty
Dressed to the nines
Comfortably sitting
On your gold mine
Blood red and blonde
Lipstick and curls
A high-heeled don Juan
Come to mess up my world
All of the ladies
Are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe
They might stand a chance
Bet every bar you walk in's the same
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone
Why'd you come calling
On this side of town
A woman who's fallen
And keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Before you get hurt
Hey Jezebel leave mine alone
Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone
This southern belle is tough as nails
Leave mine alone"
"Tonight it's been six lonely days since you called me to tell me we're through
To think just last week you loved me so but that was forever ago
I've cried all my tears sure there's none anymore my heart is empty and cold
The future is black cause I can't go back cause that was forever ago
[ dobro ]
Our yesterdays were filled with sweet dreams what happened I'll never know
But yesterday's gone and I must go on cause that was forever ago
I've cried all my tears...
Cause that was forever ago"
"It only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me that's what they say
It only hurts for a little while then all your heartaches will fade away
It's so easy to be smart with somebody else's heart
But I don't know how to start forgetting you what can I do
Oh it only hurts for a little while that's what they tell me just wait and see
My heart will break till you come back to me
My heart will break till you come back to me
(It only hurts for a little while)"
"I'm gonna lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Then I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Hey I'll lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well I'm rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack till the mail train comes back
Then I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Well now where were you last Saturday night
While I was a lyin' in jail
Hey you're walkin' the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
Well I'm rollin' in [unverified]"
"FINAL EXAMINATION
WITH DOTTIE WEST
(Red Lane - Dottie West)
You reset with the love that has built to stand on its own
Somewhere we surely went wrong
So let's study our hearts we may learn we might change our minds
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows and forgettin' all the good times we had
And somewhere love left us alone
So let's count on each other and together we might make the grade
A final examination to test our situation may find love is not really gone
We've been countin' our sorrows..."
"You and I don't need an introduction
Neither one of us has that much to lose
'Cause you're just a sister to satisfaction
And I'm just a brother to the blues
Now, I don't have to tell you nights are lonely
There's a hunger in our eyes that tells the news
And you're just a sister to satisfaction
And I'm just a brother to the blues
It's hard to tell exactly which direction
We might go at any given time
It's just a constant search for affection
And we need all the comfort we can find
I know you can feel this attraction
From a night of love that both of us could use
'Cause you're just a sister to satisfaction
And I'm just a brother to the blues"
"Sometimes I run through the woods with my pellet gun, pretend I am fighting
With the boys on Juno beach with some pinecone grenades in my red flyer wagon
And I lie awake dreaming someday I might be just like the man
With the camouflage maple leaf on his sleeve - yeah i'd be just like you dad
CHORUS
They tell me I look just like you
They say I've got your mischievous smile
They tell me someday I'll make make sense of this, each year I grow, each passing mile
They say son you walk alone now ,but they don't see what I see
I've got the footprints of a giant stretching out in front of me
There will be lonely days, days I shut out the world and just come undone
But I'll try my best to live life like you did, my days out in the sun
I'll learn about you from your best friends, laugh at the crazy things you did
And I'll walk in your steps with my little feet until someday they fit, I hope someday they fit
CHORUS
They tell me I look just like you
They say I've got your mischievous smile
They tell me someday I'll make make sense of this, each year I grow, each passing mile
And I hear that boy he is lost now, but they don't see what I see
I've got the footprints of a giant stretching out in front of me
BRIDGE
And the flag flies low, 21 guns smoke, and by thousands they say goodbye
And the guard salutes with the snap of their boots to the hero neath the red and white
There will be lonely days, days I shut out the world and just come undone
But I'll try my best to live life like you did, and fill my years with sun
And someday when you're out walkin you'll hear a voice from behind you
Sayin wait up dad and you're goin a little too fast and I'll run up to you....
...In the footprints of a giant."
"Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
children of the corn field
tryin turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear the muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
A'int nothin bout us fake
You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads
nobody got no money
got them signed up pickup trucks
whistlin at them honies
from the country (yes sir)
you know we're straight out of that long week workin
now everybody wanna party
all night long bonfire on the back 40
in the middle of nowhere
ain't nobody leaving here
till we're straight out of cold beer
straight out of cold beer
just a bunch of john deer junkies getting funky to some old hank
nothin been stuck in the mud that we came
we'll cut the rusty chain in the sun or in the rain

You know we're straight out of that dirty south dirty roads

"Well I'm sittin' on the river with a pole in my hand the river might as well be dry
No I ain't gonna catch any fish today cause I ain't got no dogfly
Maybe next summer when the wind is warm the yellow sun rise high
The fish will start to jumpin' and I think of somethin' singin' oh me oh my
Oh me oh my what a fool am I it's too late to cry oh me oh my
When my woman hang the wash over line in the rain she knew it wasn't gonna dry
Like a man at the station a waitin' for train he knows it already went by
Maybe next summer when the wind is warm the yellow sun rise high
I'll think about the woman with the wash in the rain singin' oh me oh my
Oh me oh my what a fool am I it's too late to cry oh me oh my
Well gone are the days when I used to care worry bout the good and the bad
Been so long since I was happy guess I used to bein' sad
I wait for the summer when the wind is warm the yellow sun rise high
Singin' my songs and carry right along singin' oh me oh my
Well oh me oh my what a fool am I it's too late to cry oh me oh my
One more please oh me oh my what a fool am I it's too late to cry oh me oh my"
"Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die.
You left her by the roadside
Where you begged to be excused;
You left her by the roadside,
Then you hid her clothes and shoes.
Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die.
You took her on the hillside
For to make her your wife;
You took her on the hillside,
And there you took her life.
You dug the grave four feet long
And you dug it three feet deep;
You rolled the cold clay over her
And tromped it with your feet.
Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die.
""Trouble, oh it's trouble
A-rollin' through my breast;
As long as I'm a-livin', boys,
They ain't a-gonna let me rest.
I know they're gonna hang me,
Tomorrow I'll be dead,
Though I never even harmed a hair
On poor little Laurie's head.""
Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die.
""In this world and one more
Then reckon where I'll be;
If is wasn't for Sheriff Grayson,
I'd be in Tennessee.
You can take down my old violin
And play it all you please.
For at this time tomorrow, boys,
It'll be of no use to me.""
Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die.
""At this time tomorrow
Where do you reckon I'll be?
Away down yonder in the holler
Hangin' on a white oak tree.
Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
Hang your head and cry;
You killed poor Laurie Foster,
And you know you're bound to die"
"Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Ben out ridin' fences, for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But i know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
But it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get
Desperado
Oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
And you're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away"
"No one will ever know my heart is breaking although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling you've hurt me but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other that I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you then no one will ever know the truth but me
I'll tell them I've found true love with another"
"When I look into your soft green eyes
And when I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded that what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
And I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
And be it the wind or the rain
Or the moon up in the sky
The spin of the earth or the changes in the tide
I don't know what brought us together
What strange forces of nature
Conspire to construct the present from the past
But I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
When I look into your soft green eyes
And when I see your delicate body
Revealed to me as you slip off your dress
I'm reminded that what I feel for you
Will remain strong and true
Long after the pleasures of the flesh
And I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you
I'll go on loving you"
"The man who preached the funeral said it really was a simple way to die
He lated down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must have drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' bout the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
And anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well here they come and who's that riding in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great Uncle someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
But he's not even in the ground and they say his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil"
"I gave you my heart for years and years
What more do you want from me
My laughter and my lonely tears
What more do you want from me
I've been faithful to you beginning to end
Isn't that enough
I gave you my all and I gave it again
What more do you want
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
I've been fooled by what I believed was you
Oh what a sweet disguise
I pledged my heart forever true
'Cause I thought it was you in her eyes
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh give me a clue, what is it with you
Is there somethin' that I can't see
What more do you need what more could there be
What more do you want
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh love, what else could there be
Oh love, what more do you want from me
Oh love, what more do you want from me"
"LOVE TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE
Writer Geoffrey Morgan
It's not over when you stop crying and it's the end when you say goodbye
And it's not finally done when you just walk away from someone
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
There'll be times when you're alone you'll softly speak her name
Each one's just about left you one time
Daydreaming through the glass you'll see pictures from the past
Cause love takes a long time it takes such a long time to die
It's so hard to shut the door when mem'ries won't stay behind
They'll come around to remind you there's love still locked inside
So it's not over when you stop crying..."

Let me take you away let me take you away love there's still time let me take you away
[ Bill ]
Did he tell you he love you this morning before he left (no)
Did he kiss you when he got back home
[ Mary Lou ]
No he just came in and opened up a beer and sat down by the TV alone
Did she cook your favorite dinner last night (no)
Did she wear something sexy to bed
[ Bill ]
No she just took off her makeup rolled up her hair reached for a book and just read
[ Both ]
Let me take you away let me take you away love there's still time let me take you away

Do you get the feelin' there's more to life than this

Yes we were not gonna find out who we are

"I stumbled across your old picture today
I could barely breathe
The moment stopped me cold
Grabbed me like a thief
I dialed your number
But you wouldn't be there
I knew the whole time, but it's still not fair
I just wanted to hear your voice
I just needed to hear your voice
What do I do with all I need to say
So much I wanna tell you every day
Oh, it breaks my heart
I cry these tears in the dark
I write these letters to you
But they get lost in the blue
There's no address in the stars
Now I'm driving through the pitch-black dark
I'm screaming at the sky, oh
cause it hurts so bad
everybody tells me that all I need is time
Then the morning rolls in and it hits me again
And that ain't nothing but a lie
What do I do with all I need to say
So much I wanna tell you every day
Oh, it breaks my heart
I cry these tears in the dark
I write these letters to you
But they get lost in the blue
There's no address in the stars
Without you here with me
I don't know what to do
I'd give anything just to talk to you
Oh, it breaks my heart, oh, it breaks my heart
All I can do is write these letters to you
But there's no address in the stars"

"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like a guy who's feet are too big for his bed nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep a fallin'
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep a fallin'
But there's one thing I know the blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me it won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free nothin's worryin' me
[ piano ]
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops are fallin' on my head...
Because I'm free nothin's worryin' me"
"There never was a better love
To see the light of day
If only just to lift you up
And rise above the grey
It breaks my heart, but now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
My growing pain, my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through
If it breaks your heart, at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I'll still be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
But now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there
Oh if it all disappears
You have my word I will be there
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there"
"My dream is the dream of every man who's ever seen you
It's to take you in my arms and hold you tight every night my dream
My dream is for you to love me like I love you
And to know you'll somehow always be here with met my dream
My dream is the dream of love a lifetime through
So come and share my dream and I'll share my life with you
My dream occupies my mind both day and night
And I hope someday my dreams will all come true girl with you my dream
And I'll share my life with you
My dream occupies my mind

"Hello pretty lady I'm wondering why
You sit there alone with a tear in your eye
You're drinking and thinking of someone it seems
I'm sure he has hurt you and shattered your dreams
But don't cry pretty lady I'm foot loose and free
And I'm as much lover as you'll ever see
We'll go to a place where it's quiet and dim
And I'll make forget all those thoughts about him
What's that pretty lady you're not really sad
That tear in your eye only means that you're glad
He's coming to take you away in his arms
And his lips along will explore all your charms
[ steel ]
So long pretty lady there's no room for me
In a world that's as happy as your seems to to be
I'll think of you often and recall with a sigh
That you're not for me pretty lady goodbye"
"music and lyrics by Corb Lund
I heard all them pretty girls singin all them pretty words, and how
I heard all them pretty girls singin all them pretty words, oh wow
Now I'm sick and broken hearted and I know what that song means now
I heard em sing old blues and sing about the mules and plough
I heard em sing their blues and sing about their mules and plough
Now I'm hardscrabble farmin and I know what that song means now
Reveille was called and I thought about the laurel bough
Reveille was called and I dreamt about the laurel bough
My legs have both been shattered and I know what that song means now
My sons have both been slaughtered and I know what that song means now
I heard a little bird chirp and then I thought I heard a meow
I heard a little bird, he chirped and then I thought I heard a meow
But I been walking around hungry and I know what that song means now
I heard em sing the hymns and I heard fire and brimstone avowed
I heard em sing their hymns and in tongues I heard brimstone avowed
But brother, I found the Lord and I know what that song means now
And that collection plate goes round and I know what that song means now"
"Drifting with the girl down the moonlit stream
While above the heavens in their glory gleam
And the stars on high twinkle oin the sky
Scheming in a paradise of love divine
Dreaming of a paradise that love in mine
Beautiful Ohio in dreams again I see visions of what used to be
Drifting in the moonlight while the heavens gleam ay ay ay ay
Scheming in a paradise..."
"Girl I've been waitin' on this long hard day to get over
So I can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel ya breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes
Oh yeah
You can make me work for it girl if you want to
Just leave a trail for me to follow you into the bedroom
And if you need a little bit of help from me
Babe there's not a button that I can't reach
Let's see where it leads
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
I wanna make you close your eyes
I wanna take you somewhere, out there
'Til the world fades out of sight
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
Just hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
Yeah, I wanna make you close your eyes
Oh
I wanna make you close your eyes, oh
Girl, I wanna make you close your eyes"
"Well now friends you'd never guess it so I really must confess it
I just met the sweetest woman of my long dismal life
But a friend of mine said buddy just in case your mind is muddy
Don't you know that girl you're fooling with is Peg-Leg Johnson's wife
And that man is hard and cold and mean and grim
And he'll catch you and he'll brain you with his artificial limb
But next morning bright and early I stole old Peg-Leg's girlie
And I also took his wooden leg just to play it safe
But there weren't no time for laughter cause he started hopping after
And I keep on running faster but he won't give up the chase
And I'm running through the mountains with his bride
And I got his wooden leg here by my side
I'm a three-legged man with a two-legged woman
Being chased across country by a one-legged fool
Though he's hoppin' and he's clappin' and he shows no sign of stoppin'
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel
Through the deserts and the valleys and those dark Chicago alleys
Cross the muddy Mississippi to the hills of Caroline
Through the mountains of Montana and the swamps of Louisiana
Each time that I look back he's just about one foot behind
And I know he must be cold and wet and sick
But in spite of all his troubles he can kick
Oh he's ragged and he's filthy and I'm feeling kinda guilty
Specially in the evenings when I hear him plead and beg
He says in spite of all your stealing friend I bear you no hard feelings
You can keep that damned old woman but please give me back my leg
Cause old friend I know you think you took my wooden leg
But in the dark you made a mistake you took my good leg
I'm a three-legged man...
I tell you boys this life is hard and cruel"
"(I believe I believe) I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows
I believe for every one who goes astray someone will come to show the way
I believe I believe I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard
I believe that someone in that great somewhere hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe (I believe)
Every time I hear a new born..."
"When I was sixteen, that set of keys was a pair of wings
Daddy, pretty please, can I take a ride tonight?
I swear I won't get her over fifty-five.
Was Back in Black racing through my veins, last thing I thought
Was a flip in this thing gonna get me killed.
I'm pretty sure my old man will.
And seeing his face when the wrecker hauled my freedom away
That's how I learned to pray.
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say.
I was living like I was (?), mama always said
It'd take a special girl to get a hold of me,
But I never let one get close to me.
The man upstairs must've heard her prayer,
Cause I looked up, you were standin' there waitin' on me
Like you were made for me.
And I knew right then and there, I'd been saved
And that's how I learned to pray.
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say.
I can fold my hands and bow my head,
But there's just some things that can't be said
Without a little walk on water kind of faith.
And that's how I learned to pray.
Have you ever looked up at the stars in the sky, felt a tug at your heart
Didn't know why but you just knew
Someone is up there lookin' out for you.
Well you know just what I mean when I say Grace.
That's how I learned to pray.
That's how I learned to pray."
"Watch how she tore me all apart
Watch how she ripped up my heart
Watch how she cut that thing clean through
Watch out she'll do the same to you
Watch how she wrecked love's hope filled train
Watch how she reveled in my shame
Watch how she learned me who was boss
It was gone before it ever went away
Got up and left before it even, really tried to stay
And any doubt that hung around, sure ain't here now
She's the best dirty trick, love's ever played
Watch how she tossed my affections 'round
Watch how she drug'em cross the ground
Watch how she claimed they're hers to use
Watch out or she'll drag yours for you"
"There never was anyone quite like me
I'm the only me that you'll ever see
From the top of my head to the tip of my toe
Oh, oh, oh I'm special you know
-------
There never was anyone like me or you
Being ourselves is the best we can do
We're priceless and precious for God tells me so
Oh, oh, oh we're special you know
-------
CHORUS:
We're quite unique, a walking work of art
And strong or weak we all have our own special place in God's heart
-------
We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself, never makes two
Be happy with who you are, God made you so
Oh, oh, oh you're special you know
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
We're different each one from the other it's true
God never repeats himself, never makes two
Be happy with who you are, God made you so
Oh, oh, oh you're special you know"
"We know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time we meet we both agree it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning"
"In the middle of Evie's garden
Was a rock she could never move
Worn away by a faithful hand till
No one knows the date
Bring back the rain we'll go walking
Bring back the wind like you do
Of the flowers in Evie's garden
One would never go out of bloom
Planted over a well forgotten
Opened by the moon
Bring back the rain we'll go walking
Bring back the wind like you do
Bring back the rain to Evie's garden
I'm at the gate, looking through"
"(For loving you for needing you but most of all for loving you For loving you)
[ Bill ]
For loving you my life is so much richer
You've given so much to live for and I never really lived before before loving you
(For loving you)
[ Jan ]
And for loving you my faith is a little stronger
For a world that could give you to me couldn't be as bad as it's made out to be
There was good there I just could never see before loving you
(For loving you for needing you but most of all for loving you for needing you)
[ Jan ]
And for needing you I feel a whole lot stronger
For there's a strength that comes from knowing you need to give up yourself
And darling I gave so much of myself loving you (for losing you)
[ Bill ]
And now I'm losing you and I'm a sadder lonelier man
Than I ever thought any man could be
But even in my loneliness even as I walk the hunting trail of memory
Even for all the pain that I'm feeling right now
Never once will I ever regret having had the chance of loving you (loving you)"
Ill be in your arms tomorrow
"Lord, I'm feelin' down, I've got no one to turn to
Boy, I need you 'round, these lonely nights are hard to get through
I'll get down on my knees, honey, if I have to
I'll do what it takes to please, I'll do what it takes to hold you
Take me, take me back
I promise I won't hurt you anymore
Take me, take me back
Baby, we'll make it like it was before
Do you ever think of me when all the world is sleepin'?
And you're lyin' there alone and your body needs some lovin'
But I'm tryin' to say I'm sorry so try to understand
I'll give my love forever and you'll always be my man
Take me, take me back
I promise I won't hurt you anymore
Take me, take me back
Baby, we'll make it like it was before"
"If I had counted one two three before I made you cry
If I had counted four and five and made another try
If we had counted six seven eight and made a brand new start
If we had counted nine and ten we wouldn't be apart
One, two, three come back to me and let bygones go by
Four and five I know that I've been a foolish guy
Six, seven, eight give me a date and I'll be as good as pie
Nine and ten kiss me again who wants to say goodbye
If I had counted one two three before I walked away
If I had counted four and five well I'd whispered darling stay
If we had counted six seven eight and turned on all our charms
If we had counted nine and ten we'd be in each other's arms
One, two, three come back to me
One to ten kiss me again who wants to say goodbye"
"(Bob McDill)
I've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
--- Instrumental ---
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight..."
"I wrote a careless love
""Love me not for I'm above
Above a cloud all flat and white
And with another love tonight""
And then a careless love
By weighty cloud above
Was ground into the floor
To loving breathe no more
Lady as I leave you
Limp on the floor
Distorting our voices
Slamming the door
I say sorry
I say bye bye
I say miss you
I say cry cry"
"Summer Country Skies
Charlie Landsborough
Songs From The Heart
You find romance in the grace
of this dirty one eyed town
Me I've got to get away
what gets you high just gets me down
And the difference in our dreams
I can briefly summarize
You are winter city streets
I am summer coun--try skies
Every day my heart cries
for the blue summer country skies
You can keep your kitchen sink
I can see a mountain stream
You escape inside a drink
I prefer to dream
There's a hunger in my heart
nothing ever satisfies
In these winter city streets
give me summer country skies
Unlike you my heart dies
neath the blue summer country skies
By your fascination grows
with the pleasures of the night
My imagination goes
on a multi colored flight
To a land that wears a smile
and where beauty filled my eyes
Parked on winter city streets
neath tha summer country skies"
"I'm not afraid of growing old
Or dying young or never finding someone
And I'm not scared of the great unknown
Or being alone when it's all said and done
I'm braver than I used to be
But there's still some things in life that terrify me
What about a phone call in the middle of the night
You whispering so she can't overhear you telling me
You still want me desperately
What about a knock on the door at 3 AM
Don't have to hear your voice
To know you've been drinking
What if my hand opens the door and lets you in
Oh no what if I can't say no again
I drive right by that old restaurant
The one we used to haunt
Without turning my head
And I don't think twice about killing the lights
Yeah I sleep through the nights
Without you in my bed
And knowing I don't need you here
Should leave me nothing to fear
What about a phone call in the middle of the night
You whispering so she can't overhear you telling me
You still want me desperately
What about a knock on the door at 3 AM
Don't have to hear your voice
To know you've been drinking
What if my hand opens the door and lets you in
Oh no what if I can't say no again
What about a phone call in the middle of the night
You whispering so she can't overhear you telling me
You still want me desperately
What about a knock on the door at 3 AM
Don't have to hear your voice
To know you've been drinking
What if my hand opens the door and lets you in
Oh no what if I can't say no again
Oh no what if I can't say no again"
"Forever my darling our love will be true always and forever I'll love only you
Just promise me darling your love in return
Make this fire in my soul dear forever burn
My heart's at your command dear to keep love and to hold
Making you happy's my desire dear loving you is my goal
I'll forever love you the rest of my days I'll never part from you and your loving ways

My heart's at your command...
This is my last letter end of the song my life is so miserable I can't go on"
"(G. O' Dowd, R. Hay, M. Craig & J. Moss)
Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those gold cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
But my tears gave you confidence to leave
Now you say I'm just too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart is always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Yesterday you were my brightest star
But even when you're near
I don't know where you are
I was wrong to show my weaker side
Now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry
I was blind to put my trust in you
If you leave me, I'll fall apart
Did you plan to make a fool out of me
From the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Now you say I'm too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
You never give to me
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take but never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity"
"The night is getting on, the band is getting show
The crowd is almost gone and here we are still dancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
Our feet can barely move, my legs are yellin'""Whoa""
But we're in such a groove that love is still advancin'
Nothing to do but waltz
You can't suggest that we could go on Jitterbuggin'
We've nothing left for moves more strenuous than huggin'
But we don't need much room to gently cut a rug in we two
I'm tired and out of juice and yet from head to toe
My body's feeling loose and warm and kind of supple
Nothing to do but waltz
The minutes slip away, my arms just won't let go
I think I'd like to stay 'til we're the only couple
Nothing to do but waltz
You never know how far this sort of thing will get you
We're not as tired as we would like to think, I bet you
You'd stay up half the night with me if I would let you
So come let the waltz play again"
"(B. Tosti/R. O'Hearn)
He takes the train into the city
To him it's more than just a working day
Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
She's got a job, she has a family
She tries to keep them both together
She's barely getting by, saving everything she makes
Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
How much longer, ready for their ship to come in
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
They started out as high school sweethearts
He promised her a life of luxury
And though they don't have riches they have everything they need
The eyes of her child are her diamonds
The gift of his love are her pearls
Together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world
But never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin
Getting stronger in each other's arms
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
Everybody has a special reason
There's a chosen road to follow
Just remember nothing good comes easy
Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life"

Would you look at what came down the road today
Wanting me to be one more mistake to make
A bridge to burn to get to someone knew pass me by if you're only passing through
Oh you sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you wanna be
I don't know what you think you've run into pass me by if you're only passing through
I'm not gonna be your stepping stone among the other hearts that you've walked on
Lord help me if I fall in love with you pass me by if you're only passing through
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through"
"I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands
Somebody took you when I wasn't looking and I should have known from the start
It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands"

"By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young girl calling
Micheal they are taking you away
For you stole Trevelyn's corn
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely prison wall
I heard a young man calling
Nothing matter Mary when your free,
Against the Famine and the Crown
I rebelled they ran me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
By a lonely harbor wall
She watched the last star falling
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray
For her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry.
Low lie the Fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly.
Our love was on the wing we had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely 'round the Fields of Athenry."
"Here's my keys, I want you to take 'em
I think I'm gonna need you to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't wanna lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here cryin'
I think you'll understand why
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I just lost the one that wrapped me around her finger
I need to get to where I can't think of her
So tonight, I'm the designated drinker
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrow
I may hate myself tomorrow
Oh but
[Chorus]"
"Pardon me if I can't keep my hands off of you
I can't seem to help it you see
Just a touch of your hand is a dream I can't live
Loving you is a way of life with me
If I had to walk along through this world without you
I'd fall like a leaf from a tree
Pardon me if I can't leave your lips alone
I've just got to taste them again
And again and again and again for you see
Loving you is a way of life with me

If I had to walk along..."

ONE SULTRY SUMMER MORNING IN THE YEAR OF 1918
THREE HUNDRED MEN WITH EBONY SKIN
PULLED OUT OF UNION STATION
HEADING OUT OF NASHVILLE FOR WESTERN TENNESSEE
HOMEWARD BOUND CAUSE UNCLE SAM CLOSED DOWN
THE MUNITIONS FACTORY.

BACK IN THE SMOKEY CLUB CAR A MEMPHIS GAMBLING MAN
SAID GENTLEMAN, IM FOLDING THESE CARDS
CAUSE I DREW A DEAD MANS HAND!
A YOUNG MAN IN A MILK TRUCK OUT NEAR DUTCHMAN'S GRADE
SAID OH MY GOD TWO TRAINS ONE TRACK
THEN HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND HE PRAYED
A SISTER FROM THE ORPHANS HOME MADE A CROSS UPON HER CHEST
CAUSE A ONE IRON BEAST WAS COMING FROM THE EAST
AND ANOTHER ONE WAS COMING FROM THE WEST
THE BIRD FLEW FROM THE TREE TOPS AS THE IMPACT SHOOK THE GROUND
THE SCREAMING WHEELS AND THE GRINDING STEEL

"I memorize the note you sent go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through for anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair a breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue anything that's part of you
Oh how it hurts to miss you so when I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live what can I take what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new for anything that's part of you"

Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da

"My heart thunders like a thunder on an early April morn
When my baby's close beside me and we're lovin' up a storm
If the night is cold and windy I will still be nice and warm
Cause she'll have her arms around me and just lovin' up a storm
Like a streak of lightnin' flashin' that's the love light in her eyes
And I have the satisfaction of the love that never dies
I don't care if it starts raining cause I'll never be forlorn
Long as my sweet sugar's with me am I lovin' up a storm
[ steel - guitar ]
Now this thing called stormy weather doesn't mean a thing to me
Cause I've got a lovin' baby I should love her yes siree
When she reaches out to hold me I just snuggle to her arms
And my heart gets warm as sunshine when we're lovin' up a storm
Like a Tennessee tornado that's the kind of love we share
Sorta sweet and kinda local that's the way my baby cares
Guess we'll go through life together so we'll both be free from harm
No one else could stand the wather but we're lovin' up a storm

No one else could stand the wather but we're lovin' up a storm"

"I'm a roving gambler gambled all around
Whenever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
I gambled down in Washington gambled over in Spain
Now I'm on my way to Tennessee to knock down my last game
Knock down my last game knock down my last game
Had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
Till I fell in love with a pretty little girl she fell in love with me
She took me in her parlor she cooled me with her fan
Then she whispered low in mother's ear I love that gambling man
Love that gambling man love that gambling man

Oh daughter oh dear daughter how could you treat me so
To leave your dear old mother and with that gambler go
Now listen to me mother you know I love you well
But the love I hold for the gambling man no human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell no human tongue can tell

Well I would not marry a railroad man this is a reason why
I never have seen a railroad man that would tell his wife of life
Oh mother oh dear mother I tell you if I can
If you ever see me a coming back I'll be with that gambling man
With that gambling man with that gambling man"
"Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"
"Jesus Saviour pilot me over life's tempestuous sea
Unknown waves before me roll hiding rock and treach'rous shoal
Chart and compass come from Thee Jesus Saviour pilot me
[ fiddle ]
As a mother stills her child Thou canst hush the ocean wild
Boist'rous waves obey Thy will when Thou say'st to them be still
Wondrous sov'reign of the sea Jesus Saviour pilot me"
"Shooting off vicious collections of words
The losers make facts by the things they have heard
And I find myself trying hard to defend them
I made decisions some right and some wrong
And I let some love go I wish wasn't gone
These things and more I wish I had not done
But I can't go back
And I don't want to
'Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to you
I have some ""friends"" they don't know who I am
So I write quotations around the word friends
But I have a couple that have always been there for me
And I missed some fun 'cause I worked through the dawn
Expecting your praise when I returned home
But I paid the cost 'cause I got left alone for the songs
But I can't go back
And I don't want to
'Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to you"
"Oh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Just the mention of your name turns the flicker to a flame
I think of things that we used to do then my whole world turns misty blue
I should forget you heaven knows I've tried
But when I said I'm glad we're through my heart knows that I've lied
Oh it's been such a long long time looks like I could get you off my mind
But I can't for just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue
Yes just the thought of you turns my world a misty blue"
"He-he-he-he-he lets see here now, one, n1330-1164-7235-4284-2048-4065ine hunderd
Hm-hm-hm boy, I sure hope I get a purdy'n.
Maybe she'll look like Terry Clark or Faith Hill or somebody.
Hm, hope this ain't a party line.
Here we go!
Ha-ha. I's laid up 'na house watchin' C.M.T.
Thought I'd have a late night snack
So I headed to the kitchen on a commercial break
When sup'm called me back
It was the sexiest voice that I'd ever heard
Comin' out of my television set
Said, ""Call now, you can hear me live
And I'll tell ya 'bout my naughtiness.""
So without hesitation or further ado
I grabbed a hold of my Visa
And dialed the number flashin' on my screen
1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
Oh man! Ah
So I kicked back the recliner
And on the second ring
She whispered, ""Hello. This is Sheila.
Your credit card number, please.""
I said, ""How much will it cost
For this here trip to paradise?""
She said, ""You can't put a price on love""
That's another $4.98 minute went bye
After an hour of conversation
She had me chewin' on the receiver
Well, I worked up a sweat, I's out of breath
Over 1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
Like a man possessed I dialed her number
Mornin' noon and night
And slowly but surely we fell in love
As my phone bill shot out of sight
After so many costly heart to hearts
I just had to meet her face to face
She wouldn't give me her home address
So I had her number traced. He-he.
Well, I thought it'd lead to a passion palace
Some penthouse in the sky
And, I must admit I was a little let down
When I found her in a double wide
A double wide?
That beauty that I envisioned
That goddess that drove me crazy
Answered the door with a cigar in her mouth
And weighin' in at over two eighty. He-he-ho!
They say love conquers all, well I reckon it's true
Even when it's for a fee
We said I do, and now were one
Though she makes two of me
And she talks to me no charge
Every time she takes a breather
And I'll never have to work
As long as all you jerks dial
1-900-SHEILA
You can tell it all to me
I'm your phone fantasy
1-900-SHEILA
I love you baby. Come here to me. Smooch-smooch"
"That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky so I'm movin' on
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're comin' to you
Well we're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me and so I've set you free and I'm movin' on
Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a roll and keep movin' me on
Mister engineer take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
You're gonna ease my mind put me there on time and keep rollin' on
I've told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on I'm rollin' gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on
You switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
'Cause I'm movin' on you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice now you can settle the price 'cause I'm movin' on
But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue keep movin' on"

My Crowd.
Parody of Montgomery Gentry's My Town
Enjoy
There's a big old line down at the TicketMaster
I admit it it's a sight I'd love to see
A few of them look like they need a shower
But they're holding signs saying ""I love Cledus T.""
If it wasn't for them I'd be right in the poor house
Country music fans are the best around
Them's my crowd
(Na na na na na)
Yeah them is my crowd

They get riled if they get loud
Them is my crowd
(Na na na na na)
Hey, you're with my crowd

My crowd
There's a lot of drinkin' beer
When they fire up the grill
They'll line up at the port-a-Johns real soon
If you ask me there ain't nothing louder
Than a country music concert coming through
Come tomorrow morning out in the parking lot
There'll be fifty thousand beer cans on the ground
And them's my crowd
(Na na na na na)
Yeah
This is my crowd

"Miss You Much (Chris Jonat)
I miss you much, but I don't regret
I sense your touch, that hasn't left me yet
You know a mournful ending don't ruin a precious start
A painful parting don't mean a bitter heart
And gracious your beauty
Goodness your soul
Everything's changed, and you're not here
But you keep climbing into my dreams somehow
Your voice is strange, but the words are clear
You're saying, look at me now, look at me now, look at me now, look at me now
And I do... I look at you
Well I blame you, cause you didn't try
I don't know if that's true, but I'm sure it aint a lie
Cause there was caution to consider, a consequence for haste
Now there's sorrow in the morning, the evening feels like waste
Still gracious your beauty
And goodness your soul
I remember it was cold outside
But sunny, clear, the day you died
I had a feeling, I think, or do I just have it now
That it was all over, that I was done somehow
And gracious was your beauty
God have mercy on your soul
You're saying love me now, love me now, love me now, love me now
and I do... I do love you

"Love goes out, out like a light.
Out like a flame and you cant find find it anymore.
Just when you think its lost in the rain, it comes back knockin' at your door.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
And around.
God put us here on this carnival ride.
We close our eyes, never knowing where it'll take us next.
Babies are born, and at the same time, someone's taking their last breath.
Its the wheel of the world.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
In the blink of an eye, it can change your life.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world.
I don't know what it is, I'm flying high, but I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship going down.
Life keeps on moving anyway.
It's the wheel of the world.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
It's the wheel of the world.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
It's the wheel of the world turning around.
And around.
And around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.
It can open your heart, it can break you apart.
And it never even slows down.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.

Its the wheel of the world turning around.
Its the wheel of the world turning around.

They goes to pop a top
And the floor goes to rocking
And the crowd gets loud

Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Three Chords & the Truth
Fist fights, dim lights, wifis, alibis, bubbles and booze
And it's wild women and whiskey
Yeah the party situation
Not a better combination you'll find
Wild women and whiskey
Oh order up a double
Dance and drink your troubles goodbye
No sparkle and spangle
Honky tonk angels, they're a sight to see
Yeah ain't nothing quite like 'em
Get your hands on the right one
And you'll know what I mean
Straight up or on the rocks
To get your courage up
May take a shot or two
And the party's on, right or wrong
Country song, sing-along, cutting loose
And it's wild women and whiskey
Yeah the party situation
Not a better combination you'll find

"HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
(Miriam Eddy aka Jessi Colter
How do you tell someone you don't care how do you say I don't love you
Win the heart that you're tellin' is so good and true and loves no one but you
And how could my heart be made of stone oh why must this be
I'm unable to give my love to one who gave her life for me
And how could my heart be made of stone..."
"Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you"
"(Terry Skinner, J.L. Wallace)
[Chorus]
(Gotta keep these wheels)
Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'
East or west or south to Tennessee
(Gotta keep these wheels)
Wheels of fortune movin'
Keep on truckin', keep on movin'
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company
Well, I was down-and-out until this friend a' mine
He said, ""I got somethin' here, guaranteed ta change yer luck.
""With just a few thousand dollars you can get on time,
""I can put you in a brand-new diesel truck.""
He says, ""You can make a fortune in a year or two
""It's easy; all ya haveta do is drive.""
Well, I signed my name and I took the keys and then I knew:
I was gonna be the richest man alive!
[Chorus]
(Gotta keep these wheels)
Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'
East or west or south to Tennessee
(Gotta keep these wheels)
Wheels of fortune movin'
Keep on truckin', keep on movin'
Gotta stay ahead of the finance company
Now, I ain't seen my lady in a month or two
This old rig may cost me my family
'Cause when I truck on home, you know just what they do?
They treat me just like I was company
Now I'm lost and lonely on this Interstate
My CB's broke and I ain't got a dime
I got a payment due and the finance comp'ny just won't wait
I gotta keep this rig a-movin' all the time
[Chorus]
(Gotta keep these wheels)
Wheels of fortune rollin'
It don't matter where we're goin'

Gotta stay ahead of the finance company"
"In your eyes I can see you really don't believe it's you I'm holdin' in my arms
Cause I've known you all your life
You've never been the kind of woman to do wrong
And I know you havenm't changed and I know you still wear his name
And you're still the lady that I always knew
But you look so sad and lonely
Just close your eyes and hold me ladies get lonesome too
I know you're a good woman and you try to be a good wife
But I also know that you've had to spend too much time alone
And all the life has held you is faded dreams and songs sung blue
And a love that can't go right for goin' wrong
You've still got your pride but baby pride can't hold you
Or keep you warm the way that I can do
You've always been a lady but tinight be just my baby
Cause ladies get lonesome too
You've always been a lady but tonight just lay back and be my baby
Cause ladies get lonesome too"
"If I was runnin' this country
I'd start it over from scratch
Keep what's good, pile up what's bad
And then I'd strike the match
Yeah, we'd go back to the basics
Of how things ought to be
Yeah, there'd be a lot of changes
If it was left up to me
[Chorus]
Cause what this country needs
Is a little more steel guitar
And put a litte fiddle right in the middle
Straight out of a texas bar
And give us a song, we can all sing along
From sea to shining sea
Be proud of it and always love it
That's what this country needs
Now if you want to hear about livin'
Just twist that radio dial
Til you come to a singer singin'
What life is all about
Cause you can't deny that people still cry
They laugh and they smile and they hurt
And that's my humble opinion why'all
You can take it for what it's worth
[Chorus]
Yeah, turn it on up and let it ring out
Across the land of the free
They ought to build a statue of hand Williams, Sr.
In Washington, D.C.
[Chorus]
You just be proud of it and always love it
And that's what this country needs."

Verse 1:
People always coming up to me,
And asking Dolly whats your secret?
With all you do your attitude just seems
To be so good how do you keep it?
Well am not the Dalai Lama but ill try,
To Offer up a few word of advice.

"She was born out in the sticks
In the drought of '76
Pulled the wings of bugs for kicks
She's country
Learned to drive in beat up hack
Shotgun and an old bashed hat
Chasin' roos and razorback
She's country
She'll look you in the eye
Work all day and dance all night
Drink the whole bar dry
Hot day's you can find her there
Lying by the lake and she don't care
Wearin' nothin' but her long dark hair
She's country
She's country certified
Country 'till the day she dies
She's country born and bred
She's country as it gets
Grew up fast in '89
Helped her Ma keep the farm alive
The year her Daddy died
Put a roof on the old hay shed
Fixed the truck when it blew a head
Hung in when she was over it
She's country
She was born out in the sticks
In the drought of '76
She'll never call it quits"
"Your love and mine, dear, It will shine, dear
Just like that golden ring on your finger
Love isn't just for tonight
Or two arms that hold me so tight
Love is a song that two must learn to sing
Love is a golden ring
Love's not a summer romance
Or the kiss that follows the dance
Love is forever a rare and lasting thing
Love is a golden ring
A wedding in the church
The happiness and tears
The little ring you'll wear
Will last through all the years
And in our golden days
We'll find eternal spring
With love and the golden ring
So please won't you wear it for me
With faith and sweet charity
For lonely lovers lost
This message we will bring
Love is a golden ring
Love is a golden ring
Love is a golden ring
Love"
"Under the open skies deep in the heart of Texas
The sun shines down on the cotton field
As the clouds roll by across the sky
Carry my love to the Rio Grande
Please send my echo floating down through the canyon
Maybe she will hear my call
I'll be there soon I'll bring the moon
On a string of stars just for you
I miss the one I call my own why did I leave her alone
Two days more on this lonesome ride
Then she'll be riding by my side
Under the open sky deep in the heart of Texas
I can almost hear her calling me
I miss the one I call my own,why did I leave her alone?
Two days more on this lonely ride then she'll be riding by my side
Under the open sky,deep in the heart of Texas
The sun shines down on the cotton field
As the clouds roll on by across the sky
Carry my love to the Rio Grande"
"Old folks told me you're not coming home
Old folks told me, gotta move along
Like a ripe ol' fruit on a borrowed vine
I hang around, oh Lord, I hang around
Eve stole the apple from the tree, good Lord
I know she could be me, I know she could be me
Big brother told me I got something wrong
Big brother told me sing a different song
Like a tolling bell in its final hour
I'll make a sound, oh Lord, I'll make one sound
Another man done gone, he sang this song, good Lord
I know he could be me, I know he could be me
'Round the mountain there's another shore
'Round the corner there's another door
Like a bleeding man on his native soil
I'll stand my ground, oh Lord, I'll stand my ground
They nailed him to the cross for no sin, good Lord
I know he could be me, I know he could be me
They nailed him to the cross
Another man done gone
Eve stole the apple from the tree, good Lord
I know she could be me, I know she could be me
I know she could be me"
"IT'S NOT THE END OF EVERYTHING
(Bill Anderson)
? ? '58 Moss Rose Publications ?
(It's not the end of everything)
Just because my love has gone
Don't think my life would still go on
Because she wanted to have her fling
It's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines
There's plenty of girls for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring
It's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess
Like a heart that's filled with emptiness
A life of pure unhappiness
Two arms that hold just loneliness
My rooms overflow with blue blue songs
I think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream
It's not the end of everything"
"No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
It must've hit you like a hurricane
Now you're swimmin' with a ball and chain
Sweet love's gone down the drain
Down, down
Girl you're lookin' like a walkin' dead
You need to drag a brush across that head
The crack of noon and you're still in bed
Wake up, straighten up, put on your makeup
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
You cut his head out of every picture
From the letters where he said that he missed you
All his memories, well you can kiss 'em
Bye, bye
When enough is for sure enough
It's time to shake it out and shake it up
Get in the middle of a great big love
Wham-bam thank you ma'am, baby here we go again
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
No, nobody, nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart
Nobody ever died of a broken heart"
"I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing
I've had romance a time or two
Infatuation, then I found you
I've had 'em steal my heart and run
And that ain't fun for anyone
I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing
I like the way you make me feel
And what I feel, feels like it's real
I never once said I love you
Until I felt the one that's true
I could get used to this lovin' thing
The way you call my name, in love's embrace
I could get used to you everyday
And your tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing
Yeah, I could get used to this lovin' thing

Yeah I could get used to you everyday
And those tender ways, I kinda like this lovin' thing"
"Do you think the raindrops will ever stop falling?
Do you think the stars will grow dim?
Do you think my teardrops will ever stop flowing
Till I want your love back again?
I was a fool when I played with your heart
And brought you the shame that has torn us apart
Do you think I'll ever get over the sorrow
For being the fool that I've been
I was a fool when I played with your heart
And brought you the shame that has torn us apart
Do you think I'll ever get over the sorrow
For being the fool that I've been"
"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cop pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made out of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk cap they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and have some fun now, before I melt away""
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic car
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, ""Stop""
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Please don't cry, I'll be back again some day"""
"Every Sunday I see people filing in through those front doors
Got a cross up on that steeple, yeah it's time to praise the Lord
Some watch it on their TV, sittin' on the couch
Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out
Oh, ain't got too many miles to go, to save my soul
Hey I go down and sink my feet in the water
And I soak up that sun and I watch it set

I'm as close to God as I can get
Whoah

I'm out here by myself
But I know I'm not alone
Yeah, I got all the proof I need
And it sure makes me believe

"I could give you pretty clothes show you off downtown
Make you so happy all the time
And I could be so proud of you brag about the things you do
But I couldn't love you more if you were mine
Oh I know he mistreats you and there's no love left for him
Still he holds you to the vows you made one time
I'd walk through the flame for you do anything you ask me to
But I couldn't love you more if you were mine
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine
For I miss you when I leave and my anger starts to climb
Yes I hate this life we're living so let's lay it on the line
Cause I couldn't love you more if you were mine
[ steel ]
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine...
No I couldn't love you more if you were mine"
"I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you I knew you weren't free
But I knew I'd love you through eternity
And though I knew you were another's bride
I vowed my heart would never leave your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
I never would have made that sacred vow if I had only know what I know now
There's room for only you inside my heart so close together yet so far apart
You know I love you and I always will I know you're married but I love you still
I know you're married but I love you still"

shes smiles when i get lost in her brown eyes
just knowing that she loves me
makes everything thats wrong in my world alright

chorus
i jump out of bed, and i jump in the shower
get dressed in a hurry, just to wait in rush hour
drink cold coffee from a styrofoam cup
sittin at my desk workin just as the sun comes up
the phones don't stop and my head keeps spinnin
gotta keep puttin up with the crap just to make a livin
its yes sir no sir havent got the answer call me in the
mornin its past five again

its day after day of the same old thing
cant help feeling like a puppet on a string
to keep me dancin to the same old song
before i know it my vacations come and gone
im just sick and tired of the constant grind
hangin by a thread goin out of my mind
doctors, taxes, lawyers, faxes it a vicious circle goin
round and round again

just knowin that she loves me
makes everything thats wrong in my world alright

"standing in line at the grocery store
it's February, as cold as it gets
there's a little girl in front of me with no coat on
her mama's buying tampons and cigarettes
i try to catch her eye, give her a smile
tell her it's gonna be okay, but it might take awhile
chorus
everybody's got something that they're searching for
Tuesday night, standing in line at the grocery store
the cashier seemed a little distracted
he's staring off into space
he's well-dressed and handsome
fifty-something and he seems so out of place
he looks like a football coach who just lost his way
maybe he drinks too much, but who am i to say?
chorus
we all stare at the magazines
movie stars and beauty queens
everything that we're supposed to be
times are hard right now
but we all get by some how
up and down the aisles of the American dream
everybody's got something that their searching for
everybody's got something that their searching for

"Victims of cycles, victims of life
Victims of wrong, victims of right
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
Victims of hate, victims of love
If you're rich, you're hungry for money
If you're broke, you're hungry for bread
If you're wild, you're bound to die young friend
If you live in fear you're already dead
Victims of cycles, victims of life
Victims of wrong, victims of right
Victims of winning, victims of loss
Victims of payment, victims of cost
You got the victims of violence, victims of peace
You know we're all victims, exactly like me
Victims of anything, and all the above
Victims of hate, victims of love
My soul's got a shovel, mind's got two arms
They're digging a trench, right through my heart
They can't agree, except on one thing
They've gone too far now and they're too close to leave"
"I called to say I'm working late tonight
To cancel our dinner date but she just said that's alright
Just like that she made some other plans
Saw a movie with a couple friends had herself a ball
Oh, cause after all
She's her own woman without me she does fine
She's her own woman (woahhh) but she's mine
I couldn't tell you even if you had a gun to my head
Where we keep the tarragon or even what the hell that is
Well I wouldn't last 45 minutes in this house without her living in it
I'd be lost yeah that's for sure but as for her
She's her own woman without me she'd be fine
She's her own woman (woahhh) but she's mine
Raised up a daddy's girl went out into the big wide world
Has never needed anybody's help
With everything she does for me,
Oh it's still a mystery how I fell in love with her all by myself
She's her own woman
Got it goin' on, that's suits me fine
You're gunna have to find your own woman
Ohhh cause she's mine."
"We've decided we can't work it out we might as well call it a day
We agree to disagree and go our seperate ways
We just don't seem to get along we're fightin' and we fuss
So we've agreed to part as friends is best for both of us.
But what's gonna happen to the little folks the little folks the little folks
What's gonna happen to the little folks who live in our house
Since we've decided we can't work it out we might as well ended this time
We fought enough and fussed enough and said too much this time
So we've agreed that the thing to do has set each other free
You'll go your way and I'll go mine that's best for you and me
But what's gonna happen to the little folks...
But maybe someday we'll look back and see how foolish we've been
Cause we might find just the little ones who'd lose in the end
But maybe things are not so bad, we're still in love you and I
And maybe we can work it out if we give it one more try
We owe that much to the little folks, the little folks the little folks
We owe that much to the little folks who live in our house"
"Among the local taverns there'll be a slack in business
Cause Jesse's drinkin' came before the groceries and the rent
Among the local women there'll be a slack in cheatin'
Cause Jesse won't be steppin' out again
They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried hallelujah when Jesse's head went under
Cause this time he went under for the Lord
The scars on Jesse's knuckles were more than just respected
The county courthouse records tell all there is to tell
The pockets of the gamblers will soon miss Jesse's money
And the black eye of the law will soon be well
They baptized Jesse Taylor...
From now old Nancy Taylor can proudly speak to neighbors
And tell them how much Jesse took up with little Jim
Now Jimmy's got a daddy and Jesse's got a family
And Franklin County's got a lot more man
They baptized Jesse Taylor...
They baptized Jesse Taylor..."
"[Chorus]
Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
'Cause I dreamed the world
Had all agreed to put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
Filled with women and men
And the papers they were signing said
They'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and they bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And swords and guns and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground"
"In dreams of you my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there and I'm so lonely
Without your love I'll go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory"
"The grey clouds have departed
The stars light up the night
Now I can see through darkness
The river shines with life
I've waded through the water
My soul is comin' clean
I've held my breath forever
But now it's time to breathe
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know oh
Nobody should be less than whole
So many broken people
Their hearts forget to beat
Grown numb, no one's forgiven
Go on forgive yourself
Go on forgive yourself
'Cause there's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know oh
Nobody should be less than whole
Oh yeah, ooh yeah
There's nothing like forgiveness
Oh, to resurrect a soul
Better to give it yeah, than it is to get it
Oh, I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
Nobody should be less than whole
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give it, yeah, then it is to get it
Give it, I've been forgiven so I'm lettin' you know
Nobody, nobody should be less than whole (Oh yeah)"
"Before we close out the album I'd like to thank these fine players
If you listen to any of the songs of the superstars of the recording business
The chance is at least on of these pickers was in on the session
The man on the drums Bill Harriss was responsible for getting all of them together for me
And my special thanks go to him for the long days he put in on this project
Bill is a hell of a competitor himself he drives race cars
I also want to thank writers for their new songs
Berke Tarleton out in California for Copenhagen Angel
Gil Milan a Nashville professional for The Scene We All Ain't Saw and Rodeo Trails
And Chimp Robertson of Dalhart Texas rancher Rider flyer bronc rider for the song Re-Ride
We made this tape especially for you the rodeo fans
Their available in many of the western stores or from the address on the label
Thanks for listening I'll see you somewhere out on the rodeo trail"
"I was breathein' but lord I was barely alive
Findin' reasons for losin the will to survive
I pushed the heart far beyond what it could take
Sometimes somethin's gotta break
[Chorus]
Now it's alright, I think I see a light there up ahead
Yeah it's alright, I think I've finally risen' from the dead
The fire inside of me was gone like the wind
Now it's stirrin' within
It's coming back again
Down in the askes of a light that I let bury me
One hand pullin' me under, and another tryin' to set me free
In the struggle, I know I lost my way
Somehow I never lost my faith
[Chorus]
Sometimes you stumble over steps you never take
Sometimes you learn from your mistakes
[Chorus]
It's comin' back again"
"Sleep sweet and deep close my eyes with a smile
Sleep come over me let me rest and dream awhile
I want to dream of two young lovers holding hands
The dreams that I used to dream way back when
All the things that could and should've been before the eternal sadness set in
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile
Let me dream of the sunlight shining in her hair of the days with laughter in the air
Take me back to my world of happiness again before the eternal sadness set in
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile let me rest and dream awhile"
"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind"
"You saw me crying in the chapel the tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger as I live from day to day
I've searched and I've searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to gain peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel where people are of one accord
We gather in the chapel just to sing and praise the Lord
Every sinner looks for something that will put his heart at ease
There is only one true answer he must get down on his knees
You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to gain peace of mind
Take your troubles in the chapel get down on your knees and pray
Your burdens will be lighter and you'll surely find your way"
"I'm gonna keep on living
Even though I sometimes do
Fantasize about disappearing
Down in the ocean blue
Just to get some peace and quiet
From the warfare inside my heart
Well I've been under ear-splitting fire
Ever since we've been apart
Well I'm gonna wash the dishes
Pay the bills and watch the news
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he
Well I'm gonna keep on waking
And rising up before the sun
And lying in the dark wide awake
When everybody else is done
And sleeping in their beds so peaceful
Dreaming with the love they choose
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
Yodel eh hee yodelo lodi lay he yodel lay he
And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came
Well neither one of us
Really wanna hear the town
We try to keep our friends at bay
Try to keep the gossip down
Well some folks just want the dirt
And don't even care if it's true
But then again who cares who's talking
I'm worried for myself and you
And I'll sign on
The line beneath my name
The road is gone
I can't go back the way we came
They say one of every two
Bound to be set aflame
Every level of resentment
Responsibility and blame
Well now I'm bound to break a promise
One I made to God and you
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Divorce separation blues
I've got the tough education
No celebration
Bad communication
Worse interpretation
Love deprivation
Pain allocation
Soul devastation
Cold desolation
Life complication
Resuscitation
Divorce separation blues

"Well I took you to the station to leave on your vacation
But ever since the day I've been said
The days and nights are lonely kep thinkin' of you only I need attention bad
It's your lovin' that I'm a missin' I need a little kissin'
But just to hold you tight would make me glad
I need my arms about you I can't live without you I need attention bad
Now there's lots of gals I dance with plenty to romance with
But none can match the love that I've had
I need a little pettin' lots more than I'm gettin' I need attention bad
I never thought your leavin' cause me this much grievin'
Your gone away has almost drove me mad
So baby quit your funnin' and come on home a runnin' I need attention bad
Now there's lots of gals I dance with plenty to romance with
But none can match the love that I've had
Lord I need a little pettin' lots more than I'm gettin' I need attention bad
I'm not just jokin' I need attention bad"
"Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah"
"I happened to walk into a honky tonk one night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar like none I'd ever seen
The neck was set with diamonds and though the strings were old
Like Kings of Sound they wound around six keys of solid gold
A man stepped up beside me his breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged to a mighty close pal of mine
He used to play it right here I forget the year around '45 I think
Ha I could tell you quite a story friend if you'd care to buy me a drink
[ ac.guitar ]
Well I possessed by every weakness that takes a man a fool
I bought a round he drank it down and then he rocked back on his stool
He said yeah I remember now it was '45 alright
He just returned from the Great War that's where he lost his sight
His buddies gave him that guitar at the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds as he played his way to fame
He was doing a show in Shreveport the night he received a call
To come appear on the Grand Ole Opry the greatest show at all
[ ac.guitar ]
I was driving him to Nashville it was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed I swear Mister I never saw that train
I heard the doctor tell him just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm it could have been your life
But he died that night life just demanded more than he could give
I think he couldn've made it he just lost his will to live
But this world's loss is heaven's gain and tonight he's still a star
He plays with a band of angels that's my son's golden guitar"
"Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn
Hot corn cold corn bring along the demijohn

Well it's upstairs downstairs out in the kitchen (3x)
See you Uncle Bill just a raring and a pitching yes sir
Well it's old Aunt Peggy won't you fill 'em up again (3x)
Ain't had a drink since the lord knows when yes sir
Well yonder comes the preacher and the children are a crying (3x)
Chickens a running and the toenails a flying yes sir"
"It's true you've got me going round in circles
You keep me so darned dizzy, I could cry
But every time you hurt me I grow a little stronger
I'll soon be strong enough to say goodbye
And it will be so good to smile
Gee, it's been a long, long while
After all that I've been through
Just cause I'm in love with you
But there will come a day, you'll see
You won't have control of me
You can't hurt me like you do
Just cause I'm in love with you
I'll ask whatever saint looks after lovers
I'll ask her, would you please look after me
And would you kindly hear my prayer and have a little mercy
Please if she doesn't love me, set me free"
"You came into my life like an answer to a prayer
Like a star that falls from the sky right out of thin air
Some might say it's a miracle or a dream come true
But from that day I always knew
[Chorus]
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
No one else in the world has touched me like you do
It's super natural, girl, the way I feel when I'm with you
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
I'm in paradise whenever you're around
Then when I look in your eyes there's no doubt
Heaven is missing an angel
That's the only thing that it can be
Heaven is missing an angel
Cause you're right here with me
Right here with me
You're right here"

"At the Quecreek mine nine miners went down
Two hundred and forty feet deep in the ground
The night shift went a mile when there came a shout
Somebody's hit water everybody gotta get out
It was over their heads and too fast to outrun
Together they were tied to live or die as one
Help came from all round but the drill stripped and broke
So the men penned goodbyes and wives hoped against hope
When the waters come up
When you go through the flood
In the Lord you can trust
He will be there with us
Now Jesus was laid in a hole in the ground
He was dead, but the third day God's hand brought him out
And the miners were buried three nights and three days
But like Jesus Sunday morning all nine men were raised"
"(Dolly Parton)
Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home
This big city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear
They put me down and they call me square
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
I'm goin' back to the people I love
Back to the place that I dream of
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home
The one I want to see the most
Is the boy who begged me not to go
When the sun goes down tomorrow
Tonight I'm going back where I belong"
"Why are there tears in my eyes all the time
I can't help it and I'm blue mem'ries won't pull me through that's why I cry
The world you're in has taken you from me
I know I'll never hold you way I used to do when I feel another's lips I think of you
Until the day I die I'll go on loving you
And that's just why there's tears,
And that's just why there's tears,
That's why I cry"
"They say men and women are worlds apart
With neither one willing to travel that far
But I've never bought into psychological stuff
And never claimed to be a bonafied genius
But if men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
Well, strap me in, ship me out, beam me up Scotty
Take me to the land of those heavenly bodies
Stay here if you want to but just between us
If men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
Women want a man who ain't afraid to commit
And take 'em out to dinner that's candle lit
So I'm givin' in to the battle of the sexes
And callin' up ahead to make reservations
'Cause if men are from Mars and women are from Venus
I'm goin' to Venus
If you come by the house and I'm not in
You can call me long, long, long distance
Got better things to do than sit around and talk
'Cause I'm blastin' off of this big red rock"

No I ain't full of bull
Didn't need a down payment on that pretty little plastic thing
It made my mama cry

And I made her mom whine
She blew her mouth still when I gave her a ring
My flexible

Makes me feel so proud that I'm her feller
I'd never sell her

That Diamond Rio song had way too many syllables"
"I used to laugh at all those songs
`bout the rambling life, the nights so long and lonely
Well, I ain't laughin' now
Now that I'm caught up, it seems
In all the same ambitious dreams
That only lonely life allows
And the home I don't go home to
The friends I don't see
Aren't the part of this life
That endears it to me
If that's the price I have to pay
For doing things my own way
Then it's what I'll have to do somehow
[Chorus]
Till I find my way back to my heart
For there's no one but me's gonna take my part
It's too early to say that it's over
Or to find we can make a new start
It's too early to say
Till I find my way back to my heart
I thought at least we'd meet again
Since we have been the best of friends and lovers to each other
Meet again and speak our minds
Force no issues, turn no blind eye
Toward the road that lies ahead
But it seems that I missed you
By a coast and a song
When time gets so short
""So what?"" turns to ""so long""
I cannot keep your love inside
It's a flame I cannot hide forever
In the name of hanging on
[Chorus]
I used to laugh at all those songs
'bout the rambling life, the nights so long and lonely"
"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone"
"When the stars line up
And you catch a break
People think you're lucky
But you know its grace
It can happen so fast
Or a little bit late
Timing is everything
You know I've had close calls
When it could've been me
I was young when I learned just how fragile life can be
I lost friends of mine
I guess it wasn't my time
Timing is everything
And I could've been the child that God took home,
And I would've been one more unfinished song
And when it seems a rhyme is hard to find
That's when one comes along
Just in time
I remember that day
When our eyes first met
You ran into the building to get out of the rain
'Cause you were soaking wet
And as I held the door
You wanted to know my name
Timing is everything
And I could've been another minute late
And you'd never would've crossed my path that day
And when it seems true love is hard to find
That's when love comes along
Just in time
You can call it fate
Or destiny
Sometimes it really seems like its a mystery
'Cause you can be hurt by love
Or healed by the same
Timing is everything
It can happen so fast
Or a little too late
Timing is everything"
"Got the alarm clock set for seven got the taxi called for nine
Plane takes off at eleven and I gotta be there on time
Told the boss I was going to my mother's told mama I was gonna see a friend
Don't want no one to know I'm slippin' out of town on a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling gonna have a wild weekend
Well we might go up to the mountains we might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world just my baby and me
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast baby's gonna tuck me in
Baby's gonna warm my cold cold lips with kisses on a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend...
I guess we'll talk about the future make a lotta plans and stuff
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire and make a lotta love
Every man oughta try it least one time in his life
Just get away on a wild weekend like I'm gonna do with my wife
Gonna have a wild weekend gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little mother of my two children gonna have a wild weekend"
"I've seen men look at her before
And they think, I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But, I'm only fooling me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I know all she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say, ""an old friend""
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles"
"We sit alone in the darkest corner
Waitress comes and takes our order
And looks at us so suspiciously
It's plain to see that we're lovers
Trying to be alone with each other
It's so hard for us to break free
She whispers softly, ""I love you""
This ain't your average rendezvous
Cause I'm in love with a married woman
And I don't care, I don't care who knows it
Yes, I'm in love with a married woman
And on her left hand there's a wedding band
She wears faithfully
And I thank God she's married to me
No cheap hotel where we'll check-in
No other lives we'll be wrecking with alibis
To hide a cheaters kiss
Cause if there's lipstick on my collar
You can bet your bottom dollar
It's the color she wears on nights like this
And every Friday here at five
We try to keep the fire alive
Cause I'm in love with a married woman
And I don't care, I don't care who knows it
Yes, I'm in love with a married woman
And on her left hand there's a wedding band
She wears faithfully
And I thank God, I thank God
I thank God she's married to me"
"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer
Have we trials and temptations is there trouble anywhere
If we have don't be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit"
"You're gonna know what it means to be lonely
You're gonna know what it meants to be blue
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna cry little tears someday maybe
I'll hear you say you're sorry we're through
But I'll be the first one to help you cause you need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna learn the truth the hard way and when you do you'll always know
It's bad luck to hurt somebody when that somebody loves you so
It may be today or it may be tomorrow you'll have to pay when you're payment is due
And maybe then you'll realize how much pain you've put me through
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you"
"I love you and your tango dress
And going where the music says
I pray this love song never ends
?cause when we spin like this
I know where heaven is
Right here in the moment that we're in
Love happens when we get this close
Whatever you do don't let go
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there
Every night's like New Year's Eve
Every day that you're here with me
Every touch is a cause for celebration
I want to be your birthday kiss
I want to be your every wish
I want to be your strongest temptation
Through all of the years that go by
You'll find me here by your side
I want to be there
When you dance
When you laugh
When you cry
For the rest of our lives
I want to be there
In your arms
In your world
In your heart
Wherever you are
I want to be there"

You're gonna know what it means to be lonely
You're gonna know what it means to be blue
You're gonna know how it feels to feel your heart breaking in two
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
I'll see you're crying bitter tears one day baby
I'll hear you say you're so sorry we are through
I'll be the first one to have you because you'll need someone that's true
When the wheel of hurt comes wheeling round to you
You're gonna learn the truth the hard way but what you learn you'll always know
That it's bad luck to hurt somebody when that somebody loves you so"

"Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines gaily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
But when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Down at the market you can hear ladies
Cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackey rice salt fish are nice
And the run is good anytime of the year
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down my head is spinning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
Sad to say I'm on my way..."
"I ain't gonna marry in the fall,
Ain't gonna marry in the spring.
'Cos I'm in love with a pretty little girl,
Who wears a diamond ring.
And I'm just a country boy,
Money have I none.
But I've got silver in the stars,
And gold in the morning sun.
And gold in the morning sun.
I'm never gonna kiss the ruby red lips,
Of the prettiest girl in town.
I'm never gonna ask her if she'd marry me,
For I know she'd turn me down.
'Cos I'm just a country boy,
Money have I none.
But I've got silver in the stars,
And gold in the morning sun.
And gold in the morning sun.
I never could afford a store bought ring,
With a sparkling diamond stone.
All I could afford is a loving heart,
The only one I own.
'Cos I'm just a country boy,
Money have I none.
But I've got silver in the stars,
And gold in the morning sun.
Gold in the morning sun."
"Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you
(Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue)
(My disposition depends on you)
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you sometimes I hate you"
"I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one that's silver lined
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on the streets that are purest gold
Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of a city
I want a mansion a harp and a crown
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop"
"Tulsa
There's a detour sign on the road that winds
Out on the broad highway
But the place for me is the sign I see
T U L S A straight ahead
There's a railroad crossing and the bus-a rockin'
Just-a takin' me away
But I'll pass the time, till I see that sign
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
Where the tall corn grows and the black all flows
In old Oak, K L A
In the middle of it all I hear the call
T U L S A straight ahead
I'm gonna settle down when I reach that city fair
I'm homeward bound and I know I'll soon be there
Well, there's no use talkin', 'cause I'll get there walkin'
If there's is no other way
'Cause I read that sign on the old state line
T U L S A straight ahead"
"ELI, THE CAMEL
Now, there's an old brown camel on a cigarette pack
He's a-waiting for his master but he ain't come back
Been standin' there for years in the same old place
With the same old look upon his old long face
(CHORUS)
Eli, the camel, he never gets a drink
I wonder what old Eli thinks
Standing on the front of that cigarette pack
Eli, the camel with the hump upon his back
Now, I have often wondered what his master did
When he went behind that big pyramid
Some say he got a sunstroke and the old man died
But, I think he's at the hotel on the other side
He probably found a harem and he moved on in
Forgot all about his faithful friend
Standing on the front of that cigarette pack
Eli, the camel with the hump upon his back
(CHORUS)
He never gets no loving and he don't have any fun
He keeps right on a-standing in the burning sun
Standing all the time on that cigarette pack
Eli, the camel with the hump upon his back
If old Eli could talk, well, I'll bet my boots to you
He could tell the world a thing or two
He's been all around the world and back
Riding on the front of that cigarette pack
(CHORUS)

"I was raised in the sticks,
That's where I get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with my buddies,
Boots and dog and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for my seat,
I Feel at home around a crowd of hicks
If you're on your feet before the sun comes up,
And out there in your trucks,
Makin' hay rain or shine,
Break a sweat before daylight
The kind that ain't afraid of work,
Elbow grease and good clean dirt,
Taste your whiskey made from corn,
But save your Sunday's for the Lord,
It's a good chance you were born and
Raised in the sticks,
That's where you get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with their buddies,
Boots and dog and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for your seat,
You Feel at home around a crowd of hicks,
That were raised in the sticks
How bout them girls in baseball caps,
Ponytails pulled through the back,
T-shirts tied up in a knot,
Holy jeans and old flip flops,
But they know some fishing holes,
Sure cut down some old dirt roads,
How to lock and load a gun,
She shoots you straight believe me son,
I'm so glad I found me one
Raised in the sticks,
That's where they get my kicks,
Tailgatin' with their buddies,
Boots and dogs and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for their seat,
They Feel at home around a crowd of hicks,
That were raised in the sticks
Tailgatin' with their buddies,
Boots and dogs and tires all muddy,
Cold drinks chillin' in the creek,
God's green earth for their seat,
They feel at home around a crowd of hicks,
That were raised in the sticks,
Ya, we're raised in the sticks"

Now Arnold Jones an' MaryBeth Jensen's in a 'Vette down by the Deep Rock
Had John Denver on the 8-track, gettin' high
MaryBeth's wig was on the floor
An' Arnold's feet was out the door
When we shined our flashlight in Arnold's startled eyes
I says ""What chew doin' boy?
Don't chew know that's against the law?
We just gonna hafta get this situation under control
Now my name is Fairweather Lewis an' this here's Willard Clark
We the Pottawattamie County Love Patrol.""
Then two hippies in a Chevy's puffin' grass an' sippin' wine
'Bout fourteen mile south-east a' Council Bluffs
They's passin' 'round the peace-pipe
When we caught 'em with our flashlight
An' Willard's hairy hands applied the cuffs.
I says, ""Boys you got some trouble
You committin' herb-i-cide.
We just gonna hafta get this situation under control
'Cause I'm Fairweather Lewis, an' this here's Willard Clark

Then we spied ol' Marvin Kline a-headin' south on twenty-nine
Like a midnight auto ac-cessory store on wheels
His trunk was full a' hub caps
An' his back seat full a' tires
When we picked him up and made him spread his heels
I says, ""Hands up-on the wall, boy
You allowed t' make one call
We just gonna hafta get this situation under control
Cause, see, I'm Fairweather Lewis, an' this here's Willard Clark
We the Pottawattamie County Rip-off Patrol.""
Then Orval Hinkle left the Go-Go Club on his brand-new motor-sickle
Runnin' stop-lights, raisin' hell an' causin' accidents
His brain was doin' wheelies
An' his blood was three-two beer
When we nailed him in his driveway at his residence
I says, ""Orval, you're in trouble boy
But if you'll blow this here balloon up
We gonna get your situation under control
Now I'm Captain Fairweather Lewis an' this here's Willard Clark
We the Pottawattamie County Juice Patrol.""
Then we's passin' by the Dew Drop Inn when he heard this woman scream
So we pulled on in an' parked an' got the guns out
Well we bashed on through the lobby into unit seventeen
There's twenty-eight folks in there without no clothes on.
I says ""Everbody up against the wall; show us yer identification.
We just gonna definitely get this situation under control
'Cause my name is Fairweather Lewis, an' this here's Willard Clark
We the Pottawattamie County Sin Patrol.""
C'mon, Willard, let's go sneakin' 'round in the dark some more, never know what yer gonna find."
"You look pretty as a picture
With those flowers in your hair
Years from now I will remember
This vow I made to show I care
Even as those flowers fade to brown
I will love you then as I do now
I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word
There must be somebody watching
Over me from up above
'Cause they've sent me an angel
Knowing we'd make a perfect love
I don't know if words can go as deep
But here is my promise I will keep
I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word
As God as my witness
Let the lightning strike me down
If I ever break this promise
Made on sacred ground
I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word"
"[Chorus]
It won't hurt when I fall down from this bar stool
And it won't hurt when I stumble in the street
It won't hurt 'cause this whiskey eases misery
But even whiskey cannot ease your hurting me
Today I had another bout with sorrow
You know this time I almost won
If this bottle would just hold out 'til tomorrow
I know that I'd have sorrow on the run
[Chorus]
It won't hurt when I fall down from this bar stool
And it won't hurt when I stumble in the street
It won't hurt 'cause this whiskey eases misery
But even whiskey cannot ease your hurting me
Your memory comes back up with each sunrise
I reach out for the bottle and find it's gone
Yeah, Lord, somewhere every night the whiskey leaves me
To face this cold, cold world on my own
[Chorus]
It won't hurt when I fall down from this bar stool
And it won't hurt when I stumble in the street
It won't hurt 'cause this whiskey eases misery
But even whiskey cannot ease your hurting me"
"Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
You listen to the whistle of the evening train

You better head back to Tennessee Jed

Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed
Head on back to Tennessee Jed

There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee
Well, I run into Charlie Fog
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My doggie turned to me as he said
Let's head back to Tennessee Jed
And I woke up a feeling mean
Went on down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned round, and the letters read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

"I've learned to hide my bleed within my heart
And to conceal the thing that hurts me so
For every time somebody calls your name
I cry for you but still my tears don't show
For my heart is big enough to hold many tears
Long with all the memories, I'll treasure through the years
Sweet memories that make the teardrops flow
Although I cry for you, my tears don't show
Sweet memories"
"My love is not within my reach and so I want this lonely beach
But stranger please don't bother me I don't want your sympathy
Go away stranger can't you see you're only disturbing me
And my memories of yesterday so stranger go away

There's nothing you can do or say you're not like him in anyway
Go away stranger
Please stranger go away"

Flames changing our love to desire

Girl, we've got to go our own way

More of you, putting my blues on the run
I need more of you, darlin' I need more of you
More, anything less wouldn't do
We ain't been together too long
Strange, how did our love get so strong
There's nothing to keep us apart
And we've got to catch up to our hearts
[Chorus x2]
I need more of you, changing my rain into sun...."
"Well here I am, undone again.
I know I'll see you, I just don't know when.
Little stars, all a 'twinkling,
I wonder where you are, I wonder what you're thinking.
I know I gave my heart a little soon,
I walk for miles underneath the moon,
I sing this sad, lonesome little tune
For you.
A little patch of grass, under the overpass,
I'll rest for hours, amid the flowers,
Just a tiny bird with a little song
And when the sun comes up, I'll be long gone"
"It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band
Let's go honky tonkin' honey take my hand
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows

It's dance time in Texas and the music lifts you up
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe
Now it's time for a slow dance and we're waltzing oh so close
It's dance time in Texas and your the one I love the most
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows"
"If you've never felt what happens
When two hearts thaw together
Or never seen love written in the stars
And knew it was forever
If you don't believe that destiny
Can start with just one wish
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed
Just close your eyes
And watch this
A broken heart can always live in fear
Afraid to fall
I can make those feelings disappear
In no time at all
If you wanna feel the world stand still
From the magic of one kiss
Watch this
I'll show you love like you've dreamed of
I've got so much to give
Watch this
Don't be afraid, you'll be amazed
At all the ways that I can
Show you what you've missed

Springtime sleeps
Gathering his strength while winter creeps

Loneness will be forgotten
Come next year
Tomorrow seems a distance from today
Obstacles of time stand in our way
Try to be patient be of good cheer
Time will be a blessing to us
Come next year
I miss you
I miss you
You never leave my heart
But there love I swear love
We'll never be apart
Beyond the winter of darkness we will stand
Like children in the palm of heavens hand
Nothing to long for nothing to fear
You and I will be together
Come next year
Music
Beyond the winter darkness we will stand
Like children in the palm of heavens hand
Nothing to long for nothing to fear
You and I will be together
Come next year"
"She's every reason I take so much work on
And every reason I take so much time at home
And every single reason why I'm so much stronger
And every reason I could never be alone
Look at me, you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her, you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me, she's half the man I am
When the rivers all run dry, she finds the water
And when everything is dark, she finds the light
And when it's time to fly, she's flying with me
With her on the wing, we balance out just right
Look at me, you'll see who I've found
I'm beside myself whenever she's around
Without her, you'd see a different man
It's what she makes of me, she's half the man I am
I'm what she's made of me, she's half the man I am"
"She's back in town
Haven't seen her yet
But I know that that won't last
Soon I'll turn around
And be face to face
With a feeling from my past
[Chorus]
She's an old weakness
From a place I fell
She's an old heartache
One that time didn't heal too well
It's an old story
'Bout a love gone wrong
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong
My hands still shake
And my heart still aches
Just knowing she's this close
Those steel blue eyes
And the way she smiles
Are the things I fear the most
[Chorus]
I know the truth is showing
I know I should be going home
[Chorus]
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong"
"(Hank Card/Kristen Nelson)
You've all heard tell of Pecos Bill
Who rode a cyclone 'til it broke
Well, at the Texas State Fair
There's an even bigger bloke
That cowpoke's name is Big Tex
Fifty-two feet tall he stands
Outside he's just a mannequin
But inside he's a man
And a man gets lonely
So his heart was full of woe
Until he met a filly
By the name of Heather Jo
So at twilight on the border
As the smoke begins to curl
The heard all loves to hear this story
About Big Tex's girl
All day long she sits beside Big Tex
As he greets the folks at the State Fair
You may say her motives are complex
I think she's just happy sitting there
She grew up in North Dallas full of angst
So she dyes her hair and wears black leather
But now to that angst she says ""No thanks""
Sticking to Tex through the hottest weather
She does not have eyes for the prize roosters
And she's cold toward the reptile boy
Corny dogs don't thrill her like they used to
She only needs Big Tex to bring her joy
Big Tex seems to be a happy fella
But his loneliness she recognized
Searching for a tattooed mademoiselle
Not afraid to love a man his size
All her friends in school were non-conformists
So she became a non-conformist, too
But the change inside her was enormous
When Big Tex said, ""Je t'aime, mon petit chou""
She's not lost inside the House of Mirrors
She no longer rides the Tilt-a-Whirl
Midway barkers cannot draw her nearer
She just wants to be Big Tex's girl
Howdy, folks. Welcome to the State Fair of Texas
She hears him saying
Heather Jo, I love you, though small minds reject us
Toast them with a giant Dr. Pepper
Hoist your turkey legs into the air
To the love birds of two different feathers
And their big romance at the State Fair
You might say that their love has no future
The crowd around his feet may taunt and tease
But pardner don't you try to disabuse her
'Cause she's just happy as Big Tex's squeeze"
"Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
Into New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't want to roam no more
Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I've cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home...
Well I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' round
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread
Take me home...
Take me home..."
"Now if I were a queen and a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
Well, I'd rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward would be Satan's jewel crown
Satan's jewel crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free, He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jewel crown
Oh, the life that I live so sinful and needless
Drinkin' and runnin' around
All the things that I do for the love of the Devil
I know my reward will be Satan's jewel crown
Satan's jewel crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free, He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satan's jewel crown"
"There are times I stand in wonder
To look at you and all you are
And I think I can unlock the mystery
Break through your walls and win your heart
I don't mean to scare you
There's no need to be afraid
We can take our time
But I'll take my chance and say
Let me love you really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
I can love you if you'll only let me in
I see your strength and how you shine
You're a diamond in the rough that should be mine
But you're still fighting an old old war
That's left you wounded and left you scarred
You hide your weakness
Behind those walls
You think it's your own secret
But in your eyes I see it all
Let me love you, really love you
Open up your heart and let me in
I don't know who taught you not to trust
I'll be constant as the sun that shines above
Close your eyes and take the fall
If it's really love there's no risk at all
Lay down your past and then you can begin
To let me love you really love you
I can love you if you'll only let me in"
"Long is the day, take it away
Hold it up and you don't let it fall
Cause devils play, was yesterday
And I don't care about that at all
I just smile, once in a while
Because I don't want the lines on my face
I sit right here, holding the years
And I count all the stars in space
You fall apart again and you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand...
Self respect, goes unexpressed
I don't dream because I cannot sleep
And I think the world of myself
But the world doesn't think much of me
As long as the day is full of time, there will always be room
For your hand in mine
You fall apart again and you can't find a friend
Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand
I don't want to hear
You say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see
That means nothing to me
No one's home I'm alone with my music and my TV
And I still say that yesterday is best when left to sleep
You fall apart again and you can't find a friend
Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand
I don't want to hear
You say that you miss yesterday
If you don't like what you see
That means nothing to me"
"I remember waitin' by the curb with Mr. Murphy
When daddy picked me up from school his eyes were red
We drove to the hospital in a hurry
Where my family gathered round my Grandpa's bed
He was my best friend
He taught me how to fish
And I cried listenin' to my daddy pray
For one of those I've loved along the way
She had a ribbon in her hair the day I met her
That whole next year we couldn't get enough
And after graduation she took off for Denver
And for awhile we both tried to keep in touch
She was my best friend
And it broke my heart
But I don't regret the day that she became
One of those I've loved along the way
And I hope they know
I never woulda made it this far on my own
Where would we all be without those
Fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
The friends I've made, the long lost lovers
I wouldn't be who I am today
If not for those I've loved along the way
Along the way
Now I'm just a country boy with a guitar
Lookin' back down this old road I've been travelin' on
It was never about tryin' to be some big star
For me it's always been about these songs
You see they're my best friends
They're the life I live
And I hope they put a smile on the face
Of those that I've loved along the way
'Cause I wouldn't be the man I am today
If not for those I've loved along the way
Along the way
Along the way"
"Take away the bright lights and music take away the power and pain
And you'll find that a honky tonk angel can't compare with your home lovin' saint
She's just another woman who'll never make a home
She's had sweethearts before you she'll have others when you're gone
Don't trade one who loves you for the bright lights that gleam
Don't trade your old fashioned sweetheart for a honky tonk queen
[ guitar ]
She'll lie and she'll cry on your shoulder and she'll speek of a broken romance
She'll say that things might have been different take pitty but don't take a chance
Don't take a cheap imitation when you have a real pearl
Don't take this hard hearted woman for your old fashioned girl
Don't trade one who loves you for the bright lights that gleam
Don't trade your old fashioned sweetheart for a honky tonk queen"
"I've heard them say a heartache's just a memory as soon as you forget it disappears
I tried but I can't hide my heart from misery for I remember between each tear
Between each tear I see a glimpse of yesterday
When love was happy like a little child that plays
I cry out loud for him but he's no longer here to comfort me between each tear
Between each tear"
"That's not what i said but if that's what you heard
Then you didn't hear one single word
We're so far apart, something is missing
It makes it hard when no one is listening
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Not long ago, there was a time
We were so close that you read my mind
Now things that we say end up being hurtful
Lately it seems we go 'round in circles
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said
Let's lay down our gloves, pay attention to love
It doesn't matter who's right
Or who's wrong
If we don't change baby it just keeps going on and on
I say black, you say white
I say day, you say night
We don't talk anymore without keeping score
I say i need time, all you hear is goodbye in your head
If that's what you heard
That's not what i said"
"Born in the heat of the desert my mother died giving me life
Despised and disliked by my father blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison for something I'd never done
It's been one hill after another and I've climbed them Lord one by one
But this time you gave me a mountain a mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer you gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the hardships tired of the grief and the strife
Tired of working for nothing tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine she took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living she took my small baby boy
And this time you gave me a mountain."
"Little man, you're crying, I know why you're blue
Someone took your kiddy car away
Better go to sleep now, little man, you've had a busy day
Johnny won your marbles, tell you what we'll do
Dad'll get you new ones, right away
Better go to sleep now, little man, you've had a busy day
You've been playing soldier, the battle has been won
The enemy is out of sight
Come along there soldier, put away your gun
The war is over for tonight
Time to stop your scheming, time your day was through
Can't you hear the bugle softly say?
Time you should be dreaming, little man, you've had a busy day
Little man, you've had a busy day"
"They gave you a corner room on the fifth floor
The city lights were like candy to a kid in a store
Like a king you'd lay in your bed so statefully
So thankful they gave you a room with scenery
You always were so healthy, so full of life
So seeing you so helpless just didn't seem right
And how you kept your head so high I'll never know
I guess you knew you had a better place to go
Now
You've got a room with a view
A window to the world
You always had your sights set high
And now that you're gone
Your memory lives on
And I see you smiling in my mind
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
I'll always miss you
I'll always feel the loss
I have to remind myself that you're better off
I gotta believe even through these tears of mine
Wherever you are there's a sun that always shines
And
You've got a room with a view
A window to the world
You always had your sights set high
And now that you're gone
Your memory lives on
And I see you smiling in my mind
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
With angels as visitors dropping by
Your room with a view
Hoah"
"Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no, here ya coming down the road
With your cotton dress a swishing
You're getting some attention
From all the boys in Thibodaux
Oh my, you're really filling up their eyes
Smiling and a winking
I know what they're thinking
But I'm the only one who loves you so
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Oh no, the hottest little dish I know
I know that you can tell it
You're making me so jealous
From my head down to my toes
Oh me, you could make a red neck green
The way that you're a looking
You got me a cooking
And I ain't talking bout Etoufee'
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou
You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen

You're every young mans dream
Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida

Just to stand beside of my sweet Adalida
I'd swim the Ponchartrain"

"Midnight, I've spent another lonely day thinkin' of you
Midnight, tomorrow is on its way, empty and blue
I'm so lonely, so lonely at midnight for you
Midnight, oh, what a lonely time to weep, I ought to know
Midnight, I should have been fast asleep hours ago
Still I'm crying, I'm crying 'cause I miss you so
Midnight, I lie in bed and stare at nothing at all
Wondering, I'm wondering why you don't care
Wishing you'd call
Tears keep flowing like drops from a waterfall"
"I'm always out there chasing rainbows always going for the gold
Searching for you in far off places yes I'm always out there chasing rainbows
Your memory makes me think of rainbows of summer days and daffodils
Of tender times and sweet surrender I loved you then and always will
I'm always out there...
Rainbow are things of mystic beauty that appear like magic in the sky
To tell the world the storm is over ah but sometimes rainbows make me cry
I'm always out there...
Yes I'm always out there chasing rainbows"
"I burn that dirt, hug that road,
Plug my lip with a fist full of Skoal
12 gauge cock, shift down low,
Bounce mud tires like a bass on a pole
Up ahead, something ain't right,
It ain't a deer in my KC lights
Oh sweet Jesus, a city boy Prius
Slingin' up mud, so I start a singin'
Hey (hey) city boy stuck,
He's worthless as a one point buck,
He never heard of a four-wheel-drive,
Now he's spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' them tires
Hey (hey) city boy stuck
Penny-loafers didn't bring No luck,
Should I throw him a rope?
Nope, hell no, not me
I'm rollin' on goin' on by, yee yee
Back and forth, the mud got thicker
Kick good dirt on his Democrat sticker
Run his mouth, gettin' all pissed,
When you shoulda' bought a car that you don't bug in
I got a shotgun, ridin' shotgun
No room to give him a lift
I pull over, crack a Colt on his shoulder
And put in another dip, and yell
Hey (hey) city boy stuck,
He's worthless as a one point buck,
He never heard of a four-wheel drive,
Now he's spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' them tires
Hey (hey) city boy stuck
Penny-loafers didn't bring no luck,
Should I throw him a rope?
Nope, hell no, not me
I'm rollin' on rollin' on by, yee yee
Hey city boy, I'm Earl Dibbles Jr, I'm a country boy
You're a long way from town to be runnin' your mouth
You see them smooth tires spinnin' like that,
That's why we use nothin' but mud tires 4X4
You got your hair slicked back in your skinny jeans,
Collar popped up and your car's itty bitty
Better turn around and go back to the city, yee yee
You can pop that clutch, you can pop that collar,
I'm a pop this top, while I holler
You can pop that clutch, you can pop that collar,
I'm a pop this top, while I holler
Hey (hey) city boy stuck,
He's worthless as a one point buck,
He never heard of a four-wheel drive,
Now he's spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' them tires
Hey (hey) city boy stuck
Penny-loafers didn't bring no luck,
Should I throw him a rope?
Nope, hell no, not me
I'm rollin' on rollin' on by, yee yee
He don't put a good dip in
Don't crack a cold one,
Don't fix a tree,
Don't rope stuff,
Don't shoot the gun,
Barbed wire tattoo don't even go all the way around
Yee yee!"
"I was six years old, my brother was ten
One July day came runnin' in
Seen a Ferris wheel at the edge of town
So, of course, we headed on down
Well, it took us an hour to walk that far
Carryin' our fortune in a Mason jar
It was all pretty sad, a cheap county fair
With a few old rides but there was ponies there
Well, the ponies stunk and the air was still
In that dusty circle behind the ferris wheel
This old guy smellin' of smoke and rum
Swung me up and sat me down on one
Well, I'd never rode a horse but I'd seen it done
Cowboy movies made it look like fun
This old man whispered a few soft words
It was the best advice I've ever heard
He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""
I went up a kid with shakin' hands
But I came down a full grown man
It was like he'd cast some voodoo spell
Things were different for me now, I could tell
'Cause whenever troubles come wanderin' in
His rhyme would pop in my head again
And somehow I rode through the needles and nails
Brambles and thorns that life entails
He said, ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""
Well, I know some day, farther down the road
I'll come to the edge of the great unknown
There'll stand a black horse riderless
And I wonder if I'm ready for this
So I'll saddle him up and he'll switch his tail
And I'll tip my hat and bid farewell
And lift my song into the air
That I learned at that dusty fair
Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride
Now, don't be scared, just enjoy your ride"
"It only takes two hours by plane
If you drive you can make it in a day
Just think baby if we met halfway
They say the miles will tear us apart
But they don't how wrong they are
For us forever just isn't that far
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will
When you're scared and you think we could fall
When it feels like we just might lose it all
Listen to your heart baby before you build that wall
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will
When you've been missing me a little too long
Baby be strong
I will wait for you
Through the lonely hours
Where you are
Won't change the way I feel
Oh my heart with you
You don't have to worry
This emptiness is something
Only you can fill
I will wait for you
Will you wait for me
Say you will,say you will,say you will,say you will"
"I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having daydreams about night things in the middle of the afternoon
And every night you make my dreams come true
Now all day long while I'm workin' in town time slows down to a crawl
When I'm not thinkin' about you well I'm checkin' the clock on the wall
Then it's goodbye factory and hello love and there's a smile across my face
Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love where my thought have been all day
So I'm having daydreams...
[ harmonica ]
I'm having daydreams..."
"It's been here since you've been gone it's been hanging round too long
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out it walked in
What in the world am I going to do this old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back memories of you and all the things that we used to do
It's in every chair where I sit down it follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend when you walked out sadness walked in"
"music and lyrics by Corb Lund, Dug Bevans, Michael Caldwell, Terry Johnson
My saddle horse has died and no one was in time
To save him or to reach me with the news that I'm without a mount to ride
My saddle horse has died
My saddle horse has died and no one can provide
The slightest bit of reason to encourage me to go on with this life
My saddle horse has died
My saddle horse has died and with him goes my pride
For without a charging steed beneath me I can hardly call myself a knight
My saddle horse has died
My saddle horse has died
My saddle horse has died and I am sick inside
With thoughts of armies infidel attacking when I cannot join the fight
My saddle horse has died and I am sick inside
With thoughts of heathen victories unfolding when I have been left behind
My saddle horse has died"
"If I'm a fallen angel you can't blame me for it all
If I'm a fallen angel you're the one who made me fall
Another fallen angel that's what you call me now
Because you see me out each night breaking every vow
You took my love for granted you're lonely constantly
And that's the only way that I can hide mysery
If I'm a fallen angel...
[ guitar ]
So many times I told you I couldn't take much more
Do you remember how you laughed and walked right out the door
The only way that I can stop my tears before they start
Is go the way of other girls who have a broken heart
If I'm a fallen angel..."
"You've been taken by the wind
You have known the kiss of sorrows
Doors that would not take you in
Outcast and a stranger
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years
You have drunk a bitter wine with none to be your comfort
You who once were left behind will be welcome at love's tables
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny
Meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years
You will one day come to know
You will one day come to know
All the nights that joy has slept will awake to days of laughter
Eone the tears that you have wept
You'll dance in freedom ever after
You have come by way of sorrow you have come by way of tears
But you'll reach your destiny
Meant to find you all these years
Meant to find you all these years"
"THE WONDERS YOU PERFORM
Writer Jerry Chesnut

Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little thi-ings
And you and I have never been too-oo close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most
No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshipped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do
I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved
But I believe that in your eyes this little child was somethin' special
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out
Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowin'
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marvelled at your way of bein' kind
They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance
It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you
Knowin' all these things were meant to be-ee
For the stable's such a simple thing, no wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that you were born
And I'd ask one favor if I can, help me to better understand
The mystery of the wonders You perform, Amen"
"(Dolly Parton)
It's Saturday night and it's a perfect night for dancin'
I've had my makeup off and on all day
But it's gotta be right for a night of sweet romancing
And I've combed my hair at least a thousand ways
Mirror Mirror don't you tell a soul
Of how I smiled and talked all day to you
And how I practiced every step I know of
But tonight's the night and I'm a dancing fool
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
I could of had a date but I thought I'd take my chances
I'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song
Then I'm a gonna wait till the right one strikes my fancy
The he's gonna be the one to dance me home
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more"
"The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July
Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
The moon is full my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Here comes that cold day in July"
"I denied i would hide
I denied the light
I denied i would lie
I denied the light
Why'd i deny
Why would i lie
Why would i write
Out of the boundaries
Out of the words
Out of the lines
Light up the fire
Light up the foundries
Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh...
I denied i would hide
I denied the light
I denied i would cry
I denied the light
Why'd i deny
Why'd i divide
I'd like to fly
Burn off the boundaries
I'd like to light
Fires in the world
Burn out the lights
Burn up the foundries
Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh..."
"There's a young man sits by the river
Got his head held down in his hands
There's a lost love in every teardrop
And reasons that he just don't understand
There's a dirt road runs by the river
Comes an old man stepping high
With a soft voice & kind intentions
He said son you know you're too young to cry
Some things were meant to just roll by
[Chorus]
You've got to learn to let it go, when love lets you down
Learn to let it go, so you don't miss the one waiting to be found
With a love that's going to bring you round
Only love is going to bring you around
He said now I know it's hard to imagine
That one day you wont feel so bad.
I know you're going to take comfort
From this experience that I've had."
"Well, I came in late again last night
Really, it was this morning
I had my alibi down pat
I was gonna be charming
But the locks were all changed
I was stuck outside
With a key that no longer fit
There was a note on the door
That said, adios, sayonara
Goodbye, this is it
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye
So I went down to a phone booth
Almost down to crying
All ready to spill the truth
I see she's tired of my lying
Well, I was all ready to beg and plead
And to turn over a brand new leaf
But the second she heard
It was me on the line
I heard click, she hung up on me
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lying
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking the door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye"
"This land is your land and it's my land from California to New York Island
From redwood forrest to the gulf stream water I said this land belongs to you and me
As I went roaming that river of highway I saw above me there in the skyway
I saw below me that golden valley I said this land belongs to you and me
This land is your land...
[ banjo ]
I roamed and rambled I follow my footsteps
I crossed golden sands of your diamond desert
And all around me a voice kept saying it said this land was made for you and me
This land is your land...
[ ac.guitar ]
As the sun was shining and I was strolling
And the whitfields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As I thought of lifting a voice was saying it said this land was made for you and me
This land is your land..."
"Don't think that I don't see the way you struggle
Watching me struggle
Don't think that I don't feel you turn away
Every time I turn away
And please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
For the same thing
You're 5' 3"" born in Carolina
Front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I never knew I had a fighter
I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while
You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town
My t-shirt in the morning
Midnight in my hands
At day you're still here, I just don't understand
Never knew I had a fighter
Just when I thought I knew everything about you
You're 5' 3"" born in Carolina
Still front pew pretty
And Friday night free
You're dashboard singing
Little red Corvette
Sweet as forgiveness
From the moment that we met
I Never knew I had a fighter
I Never knew I had a fighter
Please believe that I believe
When I'm praying
That you're right beside me praying
Never knew I had a fighter"
"[Chorus]
Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
I know you want her but the answer is 'No sir'
Back up buddy don't you come any closer, she's mine all mine
Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you
[Chorus]
Oh buddy I've seen you making your play for the baby doll on my arm
You'd better back up and get out of my way, I'd hate to do you harm
I'll give you a hint that'll help you a lot, get a doll that's all your own
I'll give you most any thing I got but leave my baby alone
[Chorus]
I'm crazy in love and maybe that's why I'm a little bit jealous too
So back away boy, don't give her the eye, don't make me mad at you
I never have been the troublesome kind but it never too late to start
And trouble is what the joker will find that flirts with my sweetheart
[Chorus]"
"Everyday I rush right home,
Just like you were there waitin' on me,
To put the final touch on one more day.
There's always no answer when I call your name,
But I act as though nothing's changed;
It's easier for me to live this way.
As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.
So I go on as if I didn't know,
As if I didn't know.
Every night it's the same routine,
Off to sleep in search of a dream,
Where we're as happy as we ever were.
And I'll admit I've gotten good,
At makin 'em end the way the way they should;
That way I can deal with all this hurt.
As if I didn't know you left me,
I pretend you're right here in my arms.
I don't see what it hurts to still love you;
No, I don't see any harm.
So I go on as if I didn't know,
As if I didn't know."
"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair.""
All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare.
In our town, no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.
Through the night my heart was aching.
And just before the dawn was breaking,
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.
If I live to be a hundred,
I will never, never know from where,
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair."
"I do not count what I've lost, what I'm losing
I'm a traveller with no fixed abode
All of the gifts yesterday spent refusing
May well be waiting further down the road
-------
I tried to take every chance I was given
But if luck's a lady she never showed
There's more to life than just making a living
My life is waiting further down the road
-------
CHORUS:
Further down the road
I can see the light
Further down the road
Everything 'll be all right
Further down the road
I will be free
Further down the road
Heaven waits for me
-------
All of the years chasing smoke-rings and rumour
Looking for seed that had never been sown
Old Father Time has a strange sense of humour
He'll hear me laughing further down the road

REPEAT CHORUS:
No looking back
I'm moving on
I'm having no regrets
What's gone is gone

REPEAT CHORUS TWICE:"
"Well I was waiting for you all nite baby
tellin myself what we're doin is crazy
'cuz we both know what we're headed for
your heart belongs to a friend of mine
someone else has got a claim on mine
here we are lying in each others arms tonight
we both know what we're doin is wrong
we cant stop it, we're too far gone
We're out of contol
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
we're only headed one way
theres no turning back
just a matter of time before we crash
out of control
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
Well it started out as a mild flirtation
and grew into this complicated situation
of tangled lies and weak alibies
you got somewhere else that you should be
theres someone out there waiting for me
but for now theres nowhere else we'd rather be
we both know this afair can't last
we're so caught up we're blinded to the past
We're out of control
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
we're only headed one way
theres no turning back
just a matter of time before we crash
out of control
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
Well there's warning signs all around
hit the breaks and I slow it down
we ain't payin no heed
we keep on pickin up steam
Like a runway train
on a dead-end track
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
we're only headed on way
theres not turning back
just a matter of time before we crash
out of control
like a runaway train
on a dead-end track
like a runaway train"
"I don't know why I love women
That love to do me wrong
I don't know why my life sounds like
A heart broke country song
I ain't really happy
Unless the sky starts driving rain
Maybe I just get off on the pain
And my whole life I been picking fights
There ain't no way to win
There's a hundred scars I should have run away
Now tattooed on my skin
There's a side of me that just won't stop
Dancin' in the flame
Maybe I just get off on the pain
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
And hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
I wake up every morning, a thousand miles from home
Praying for forgiveness
For this aching in my bones
It would be so easy
To find a better way
Oh but I know I'll never change
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain
'Cause I love the long shot
And the left out lost causes
Hanging out in the back of the pack with the dark horses
I ride the wrong road just as fast as I can
God knows there's no one else to blame
I know I'm the only one to blame
Sometimes I think I get off on the pain"
"Will Santy come to Shanty town to a poor little boy like me
Will he bring me some toys like the other girls and boys
Will Santy come to Shanty town if he sees our Christmas tree
Mommy said he would if I promised to be good
For we don't have a fireplace or a chimney on our shack
Like the other lucky children have who lived across the track
Now if I say my prayers each day when Christmas rolls around
Will Santy come to Shanty town
[ guitar ]
He didn't stop last Christmas Eve doesn't he know we live here
Will my mommy have to paint my toys the way she did last year
Now if I say my prayers each day..."
"Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Bicycles are made for rain
One hand on handlebars
One on my umbrella
My ankles are getting wet
But I can't help but steer
For the deepest puddle
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Double dutch was made for sunny days
When we've been driving such long hours
Our legs get restless so we need to jump and run
and laugh with one another
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles
Life can be uncertain at the best of times
Try to move quicker by the worst of times
All things are made better when you have some friends
to get by with a little help
Bathing suits are made for sandy beaches
Where the waters warm in the afternoon
I can do no dolphin kick but I can spin in circles
Float till the rise of the moon
Let the waves roll
Wash us to the shore
Nothing can sink our smiles
And if there is no sun
When we're far from home
Nothing will sink our smiles
Let the rain fall
Soak us to the bone
Nothing will sink our smiles

"Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you,
Yeah, my love will follow you
[Chorus]
My love will follow you
Down every highway or your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go
So close to the door, turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you,
Yeah, my love will follow you
[Chorus]
If you should go so far, that you cannot get back
Girl, you may not remember,
But my heart will not lose track
So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh, follow you
My love will follow you"
"Two blue hearts steppin' off a nowhere train
Standin' on a one-way street dreamin' bout a long sea cruise
Gonna have a brand new start
Gonna have a grand new part to play
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
We won't turn back, we got some place to be
A better life ahead for the likes of you and me
Leave our sorrows behind
That was a bad old time we had
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
We were young and we were runnin'
Like our life depended on it
But that ain't no way to live, now is it dear
There were stars a fallin' far and wide
To guide us on our nowhere ride
You don't know where you're goin'
'Til it's the end of the line
Two blue hearts standin' on a dead-end track
Lookin' like the cat drug in dreamin' bout a moonlit kiss
Gonna have a life real sweet
Keep it all nice and neat somehow
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
With this change of reservation
We'll arrive our destination
No memories to haunt us in this world
With these limiles of life behind us
There's no sadness here to bind us
No reason to look back
Now we're just lookin' up ahead
Two blue hearts steppin' off a nowhere train
Standin' on a one way street dreamin' bout a long sea-cruise
Gonna have a life real sweet
Keep it all nice and neat somehow
We're gettin' off a nowhere train
Oh darlin', you and me
We're gettin' off a nowhere train"
"He walked into the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall barstool
And with a long soft Southern drawl said
""I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool""
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down
And she thought ""I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town""
She said ""Hello, country bumpkin""
""How's the frost out on the pumpkin?""
""I've seen some sights but, man, you're somethin'""
""Where'd ya come from, country bumpkin?""
It was just a short year later in a bed of joy-filled tears yet death-like pain
Into this wondrous world of many wonders one more wonder came
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy-child feeding at her breast
And she said ""Hello, country bumpkin""
""Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin""
""I've seen some sights but, babe, you're somethin'""
""Mamma loves her country bumpkin""
Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet and peaceful country place
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face
She was lying on her deathbed knowing fully well her race was nearly run
But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son
And she said ""So long, country bumpkin""
""The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin""
""I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'""
""See you later, country bumpkin""
She said ""So long, country bumpkin""
""The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin""

""I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'"""
"Set up two glasses, Joe
And turn the jukebox low
And let me sit and reminisce
While I pretend that she
Is sittin' here with me
The way she did not long ago
We used to paint the town red
And dance until two
Well I don't paint it red no more
But I'm paintin' it blue
He's stole her love I know
But he can't stop me, Joe
From having just a dream or two
Set up two glasses, Joe
Maybe you didn't know
But there's a memory in the room
A memory that walks
A memory that talks
And haunts me everywhere I go
I'm just a fool who loves her
And will till I die
From the very first hello
Until the last goodbye
And this is that you know
So fill two glasses, Joe
And leave me here alone to cry"

"Farewell Angelina, the bells of the crown
I've been stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles, and the trumpets play slow
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's on fire and I must go
There's no need for anger, there's no need for blame
There's nothing to prove, everything's still the same
Just a table that's empty by the edge of the sea
Farewell, Angelina the sky is trembling, and I must leave
The Jacks and the queens have forsaken the courtyard
2 gypsies now fight passed the guards
In a space where the dukes and the ace once ran wild
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding I'll see you in a while
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting crossed in the sun
Shooting 10 cans with a sort-of shot-gun
And the neighbors they claW and they cheer with each blast
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave fast
Hang calm, little elves on the roof tops they dance
Valentino-type tangos while they make-up man's hands
Shu the eye of the dead, not to embarrass anyone
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's embarrassed and I must be gone
The machine guns are roaring, the prophecy rocks
Avenge nailing time-bombs to the hands of the flock
Call me any name you like, I will never deny
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's erupting, I must go where it's quiet
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is on fire and now I must go"

But having known you I can feel a little stronger

"Way down in the state of Georgia through the swamps and the everglades
There's a big ol' hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had me a girl in waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful way
She made me feel I was unwanted like the birds and the bears in Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me couldn't take her lowdown ways
Before I'll stay with the cheatin' woman I'll go and live with the bears in Miller's Cave
Caught her out one Sunday morning with some guy they call Big Dave
The meanest man in waycross Georgia I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
I said you'll pay both you and Davy I'm a gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
I took their cheatin' schemin' bones to Miller's Cave
That woman made me feel unwanted but I guess I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave"

If you lived here, you'd be on the phone
Talking to your momma
Saying you ain't gone and left here yet
But someday you was gonna
The day I pledged my love for you
Sure raised a few eyebrows
If you lived here, you'd be home now
You keep wanting me to be something that I'm not
What you see is what you get
And I'm the one you got
And I'm tired of breaking these rocks
Up in this field my heart won't plow
If you lived here you'd be home now
If you lived here, you'd be at my throat
Like every time before
Slinging them old hurting words
And walking on out the door
Sometimes I think I might want you back
But there ain't no way, no how
If you lived here, you'd be home now"
"Tell you a little story and it won't take long
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
For that young man was always well
He planted his corn in the month of June
And by July it was up to his eyes
Come September, came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost
His story, kith, had just begun
Said, ""Young man, have you hoed some corn?""
""Well, I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain
But I don't believe I raised no grain""
He went down town to his neighbor's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin', ""Pretty little miss, will you marry me?""
Little miss what do you say?""
""Why do you come for me to wed?
You, can't even make your own corn grain
Single I am and will remain
A lazy man, I won't maintain""
He turned his back and walked away
Sayin', ""Little miss, you'll rue the day
You'll rue the day that you were born
For givin' me the devil, 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn"""
"There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
There's no love left...
[ steel - fiddle ]
When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold
There's no love left...
There's no love left..."
"I'll never tell you I love you I'll never say that I do
I'll never tell you I love you but still you know that I do
Sitting all alone in the moonlight feeling so lonesome and blue
Soft breeze is there in the moonlight brings back sweet mem'ries of you
[ steel ]
I know that you found a new love that's very easy to see
Someone is getting your true love but still I know it's not me
I wonder if you'd be forgiving if you knew that soon I would go
If I can't have you while I'm living I'd be better off down below
I'll never tell you I love you I'll never say that I do
I'll never tell you I love you but still you know that I do"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"
"If when you give the best of your service telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismayed when man don't believe you he'll understand and say well done
Refrain
Oh when I come to the end of my journey weary of life the battle is won
Caring the staff and the cross of redemption he'll understand and say well done
Misunderstood, the savior of sinners, hung on the cross he was God's only son
Oh hear Him call to His father in heaven, let not my will but Thine be done.
If when you've tried and failed in your trying, hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and come quickly to Jesus, He'll understand and say well done."
"Don't choose me because I am kind
If your heart settles on me
I'm for the taking
Take me for longing or leave me behind.
I would be, for you, a fire in a rainbow
I would be, for you, an opening door
Time and hard lessons are one kind of wisdom
Try to forget them or love me no more.
--- Instrumental ---
I'm not asking your heart to believe me
I'm not asking for promise or pledge
Whatever the answer, it's yes that's the question
I am the fool dancin' over the edge.
--- Instrumental ---
Don't choose me because I am faithful
Don't choose me because I am kind
If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking
Take me for longing or leave me behind..."
"Late at night a disc jockey plays a sad song by request
For some lonely girl in a one room world whose tears won't let her rest
For she lives every word of the song she just heard
As she clutches her pillow so tight
She's just one of those lonely people in the night
It's three a.m. in New York City but the wino he doesn't know
His bottle is empty his pockets are empty and where did his pals all go
He shared with them and he cared for them
For a while everything was all right
Now he's one of those lonely people in the night
Just look at the lonely people in this world
There's too many women without a man and boys without a girl
If we lonely people could find one another
What a happy world this could be
For there's too many lonely people just like me"
"Everything I do
Surrounds these pieces of my life
That always change
Or hey, maybe I've changed
Sometimes being happy
Can be self-destructive
Even when you're sane
Yeah you're only insane
But don't bother waking me today
Here I am
I'm so young
Hey I am bitter
I've been jaded
'Cause everyday
I bite my tongue
If you only knew
My mind was full of razors
To cut you like a
Worry from this song
This is my song
This is my song
I live everyday
Like they'll never be a last one
Till they're gone
And they're gone
I'm stick to make me your
Your attention and your friendship
And your time
So you could come and get it from now on
[Chorus:]
This is my song
This is my song
[Chorus:]"
"I know your heart is aching mine is too
I know exactly what you're going through
So helplessly I've had to just stand by
And watched her hurt you so much I could die
So maybe now I'll have the chance to try
To kiss away your tears and help them dry
Please accept my love and take the hand
Of a girl who'll always satisfy her man
Inside my arms it's nice and warm always for you
And I know I'll make you understand
There'll be no doubt you'll never be without a love so true
From a girl who'll always satisfy her man
So come to me I'll hold you tenderly you'll be in the hands
Of a girl who'll always satisfy her man"
"Lonely's To The Bone
I took her keys, she took a cab
She made sure the front door slammed
Between the rain and the whiskey the whole thing was still a blur
She caught a plane to San Antone
I got that far then the trail went cold
Since then I haven?t heard a single word from her
Then I found out that
All I?ve lost is all I want
And all I?ll ever need
And I realize the deepest cut
Can take a while to bleed
'cause suddenly it hit me that
She left me all alone
And leaving?s only skin deep
But lonely?s to the bone
The phone would ring once or twice
It?d be some number I don?t recognize
But nobody?s ever home when I call it back
Door?s unlocked, coffee?s on
The fire?s burnin? but she still ain?t home
Don?t know if I?ll ever learn to live with that
And I found out that
CHORUS
Oh, it would be so easy if
Her memory?d just move on
And leaving?s only skin deep
But lonely?s to the bone
Lonely?s to the bone x3"
"I wish there was some way to tell you I'm sorry
That I didn't leave you a long time ago
But many mistakes are part of the story
And heartache by heartache I've turned you to stone
So call me a traveller, gonna catch me a train
I want to see Frisco feel the sun shine again
If you want true love you can't stand alone
A life here together has turned you to stone
I've held you captive in a life without sunshine
And I've watched the blue in your eyes fade away
All good is gone now, no need to continue
Destroying each other day after day
So call me a traveller, gonna catch me a train
I want to see Frisco feel the sun shine again
If you want true love you can't stand alone
A life here together has turned you to stone"
"Spent a week in Houston and watched it
Spent a day in Dallas missing
Lord, it sure was cold up in Montreal
I thought of you and I should've
Acapulco, lying in the sun
Spending all my gold drinking
Mexicali women, tan and tall
Wish you were here, I should've called
In spite of all my good intentions
I am the one who built the wall
All by myself, who ever thought
I sure miss you, I should've called
California is nice this time of year
Colorado and they got good
Back in Tennessee it's and early fall
I still love you, I should've called"
"I've got some mighty tall tales from livin' hard and fast
I'm a walkin,' talkin,' livin,' breathin,' portrait of my past
I've double-crossed the devil, prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Escaped some early graves by the skin of my teeth
All the deepest secrets of my soul the world can plainly see
'Cause everything I've ever done is written all over me
If you just read between the lines of this well-weathered face of mine
Every wrinkle, every scar was a painful work of art
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
As these souvenirs that livin's left behind
So take a long, hard look at the cover of this book
And read between the lines
And read between the lines
They might be hard to find on this rigid face of stone
There are pleasant deep impressions that are solid as gold
And I'll be the first to tell you that this ol' boy's been blessed
'Cause even the worst of times have turned out for the best
Like roads on a map they cross a battered stretch of skin
You can trace your way through memory lane to anywhere I've been
If you just read between the lines of this well-weathered face of mine
Every wrinkle, every scar was a painful work of art
That reminds me of mistakes that I've made
And no story I can tell can tell it quite as well
As these souvenirs that livin's left behind
So take a long, hard look at the cover of this book
And read between the lines
And read between the lines"
"I'll play second fiddle
To your new love while it lasts
Just like all the others
I've played for in the past
Why can't I be a leader
And play your leading part?
Why must I always have to play
Second fiddle in your heart?
Play fiddle play
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?
Each time you find a new love,
You leave me here to cry
The teardrops tell a story,
Of a love that just won't die.
Like an early mornin' paper,
The news you get just parts
Why must I always have to play
Second fiddle to your heart?
Play fiddle play.
Will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part
Of second fiddle to your heart?"
"Now if you love your mama and you treat her right
But you keep some fussin' ain't you every day and night
She's gonna triflin' on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you gonna lose your mind
Now if your baby's mean take a tip from me
Lock her up at home boy but hang onto the key
She's gonna triflin' on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' Lawd you nearly lose your mind
But if your mama's good I tell you what to do
Give her lots of lovin' boy but watch her closely too
She's gonna triflin' on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you gonna lose your mind
Now you come on to your mama find your clothes ain't clean
You can bet you're slippin' boy forget just what I mean
Cause she's been triflin' on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you nearly lose your mind
Now you may have a mama says she is true
Wait till you get down out and really mean to do
She's gonna triflin' on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' Lawd you nearly lose your mind
I've been a lotta places not much I ain't done
But when it comes to women boy I just don't trust a one
Because they'll trifle on ye well do it every time
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you gonna lose your mind
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you gonna lose your mind
And when your baby starts a steppin' boy you gonna lose your mind"
"All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You can hear Jesus callin' but you won't accept his hand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
When you come to cross the river Jesus won't give the command
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
And that dark rollin' river takes you to the sinkin' sand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray"
"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
Oh but not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, a cold towel,
A dirty hat pulled low across my face (across my face)
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the back roads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind"
"Ahhh... we'll snort with pleasure
Ahhh... we'll forego washing
We'll hold a holiday of love
I'm a green tree you're the air
I'll follow you there
I'll follow you
Engulf me lover
Ahhh... we'll take a tumble
Ahhh... down in the gravel
I'll take your hand to lead me over
Hang our colors in the air
I wanna follow you there
I wanna follow you
Engulf me lover
And loop me into blue
Enfold me lover
Ahhh... we'll taste the nectar
Ahhh... we'll share the bounty
I'll bear the cost of our defense
Never looking back again
I'm gonna follow you in
I wanna follow you
Engulf me lover
And loop me into blue
Enfold me lover
Enclose me lover"
"Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that your out there listening
I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And any time I doubt myself I think of you
'Cause It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Dreams can come true
With God's great angels like you
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
It was your song
It's always been your song"
"there's a green,green place
where you lift your face
to the sound of the waves and the wind
down by the shore
where my soul does endure
where the Mother Sea ends and begins
take me home
to the sand and the foam
where my dreams walk in the mist
i'll fall to the earth and root like a rose
in the salt land
that gave me my birth
though i wander afar
the same sea,the same stars
still shine to the tears in my eyes
they take me home to a land
that my soul understands
where the heart of the rose never dies
take me home
to the sand and the foam
where my dreams walk in the mist
i'll fall to the earth and root like a rose
in the salt land
that gave me my birth"
"Watch that man get up and go to work every day
And watch that woman send their little girl outside to play
And watch and you might see the milkman drive up to the door
While the baby plays with her old ragged doll and sings these words once more
Baby loves her dolly true but who in the world who loves who
And as she combs her dolly's curles sings who loves who in this whole world
Who loves who in this old world
Watch that man come home from work which scared hand's so sore
Watch his woman never look as he comes through the door
And watch that little girl try to climb upon her daddy's knee
As he coldly pushes her away and turns to his tea
Watch that little girl go to bed and slowly search for sleep
Watch her watch her bedroom door but no one comes to peep
And as she listens to the lonely restless dreamless night
She thinks of her tomorrow and holds her dolly tight
Baby loves her dolly true..."
"At first I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought
But I must have been wrong
It could have been the music cause it sounded so sweet
Something sure was sweeping me off of my feet
All night long, it sure was strong
Before I knew what was going on, I was going, going, gone
I suppose it could have the perfume from a honey-suckle vine
Something sure was driving me out of my mind
But I should have known all along
It was your love and it was so strong
I was going, going, gone
It might have been the magic written in the stars
Some gypsy might have read it somewhere in the cards
It really doesn't matter cause whatever it was
It led me straight to your arms
First I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist
After all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought (so I thought)
But I must have been wrong
Before I knew what was going on
I was going, going, gone
Going, going, gone
Going, going, gone"
"Old Joe Clark's a fine old man
Tell you the reason why
He keeps good liquor 'round his house
Good old Rock and Rye
Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
Fare ye well, I say
Fare ye well, Old Joe Clark
I'm a going away
Old Joe Clark, the preacher's son
Preached all over the pain
The only text he ever knew
Was High, low, Jack and the game
Old Joe Clark had a mule
His name was Morgan Brown
And every tooth in that mule's head
Was sixteen inches around
Old Joe Clark had a yellow cat
She would neither sing or pray
She stuck her head in the buttermilk jar
And washed her sins away
Old Joe Clark had a house
Fifteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie
I went down to Old Joe's house
He invited me to supper
I stumped my toe on the table leg
And stuck my nose in the butter
Now I wouldn't marry a wider
Tell you the reason why
She'd have so many children
They'd make those biscuits fly
Sixteen horses in my team
The leaders they are blind
And every time the sun goes down
There's a pretty girl on my mind
Eighteen miles of mountain road
And fifteen miles of sand
If ever travel this road again
I'll be a married man"
"Columbia's unwound
If it gets any worse
Gonna have to go down
Get me some military training
Embark on a little mission
Slap some bicycle together
Got to get the ball rolling
Let's just say
Got to wrap some roses
Snug in a tortilla
Got to pay a little visit
To Fatty Carmello
Helps keep the classical
Up on the radio
Hell, I can't help it
If God don't walk here
Everytime I want to work
But maybe if my bed is made
Or I cast a vote
Take it easy on the wino
Or give up the smoke
Ole Fatty Carmello
Ole Fatty gonna be broke
And I can just use
What's laying around the house"
"I got a letter from my mama just a line or two
She said listen daddy your good girl's leavin' you
That's all she wrote didn't write no more
She'd left the gloom a hanging round my front door
Now I woke up this morning a quarter past three
I just couldn't realize this could happen to me
That's all she wrote
Now listen pretty mama you know you done me wrong
Didn't even give a warning till after you were gone
That's all you wrote
Now someday you'll be sorry your heart will ache with pain
You'd give a million dollars to write that note again
That's all you wrote
Now listen all you ramblers who think your girl is true
Don't ever be too certain or you'll be singing too
That's all she wrote"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down...can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat..."
"Some where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you are
When I look into your eye's
It's so plain to see
Nothin' here on earth describes what you mean to me
Out of this world when I hold you in my arms
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Lucky me to be the one to find
Someone like you this side of paradise
I know how lost I'd be without here sweetheart
Heaven must be wondering where you are
Some where up there beyond the blue
Surely by now somebody's missin' you
I found the angel they must be lookin' for
Heaven must be wondering where you are"
"Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, not something I can get used to
I just have no use
For Christmas without you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
You know that I love you
I need you
I want you
Oh, yes I do!
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you"
"The sun is hot and that ol' clock is movin' slow and so am I
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime but it's July
Gettin' paid by the hour, older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin' but think I'll just call it a day
And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be here to pay, hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation is gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I've just sailed away
And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
I could pay off my tip
Pour myself in a cab and be back to work before 2
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
I say, pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
He don't care and I don't care, it's five o'clock somewhere"
"Walk round town, spending my money, thinking about you
Wondering why, because you were my honey, what did I do
I'm tired, yes I'm tired, why Lord goodbye
I've tried, yes I've tried, why Lord goodbye
You made my life, oh so much better, being with you
Cause since you've been gone, I don't know whether, I'll make it through
Because I'm tired, yes I'm tired, why Lord goodbye
I've tried, yes I've tried, why Lord goodbye"
"Song sung blue everybody knows one
Song sung blue every garden grows on
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
You sing 'em out again
Song sung blue weeping like a willow
Song sung blue sleeping on my pillow
Funny thing but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know it starts the feeling good you simply got no choice
[ strings ]
Me and you are subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
Song sung blue weeping like a willow
Song sung blue sleeping on my pillow
But when you take the blues and make a song you sing 'em out again
Song sung blue"
"I just come into this bar
To have a quick one
Maybe give the bowling game a whirl
Well you sat down next to me
And in a minute I could see
That you're a complicated kinda girl
You say there's someone home waitin' for you
But you don't really care much if he cares
If you're prayin' for a chance
Had a really big romance
I don't think I'm the answer to your prayers
'Cause I've got all the heartaches
I can handle back at home
I got all the pain and sufferin' I can use
While I thank you for your gracious invitation
I'll call you when I'm runnin' short to blues
It's true that you might love me
More than she does
And we might be a whole lot more than friends
But I might start to love you as much as he does
And then you'd be out looking once again
I've been traveling down
Love's rocky road a long time
And I guess that I should know a danger sign
So you stay here try to drown your trouble
And I guess I'll go walking home to mine
'Cause I've got all the heartaches
I'll call you when I'm runnin' out of blues"
"He made it to every ball game
Unless he just had to go to work
He always said a man's got to juggle his time and his money
And he's got to know, what each one is worth
He taught me so many things
Even when he wasn't trying to
And when I'm in a situation I can't figure out
I just ask myself what would he do
I'm walking in my father's shoes
He's never let me down
That's a lot to live up to
Stumbling falling
Tryin' to stand tall in
Walking in my father's shoes
I'm balancing my checkbook, balancing my life
Chasing down a dollar, trying to buy some time
I jump out in the fast lane, sometimes I risk it all
Running myself right down to a crawl
Then I get up on Sunday morning
And get down on my knees
I always feel that he's right there listening
Giving me direction and giving me strength
I'm walking in my father's shoes
He's never let me down
That's a lot to live up to
Stumbling falling
Tryin' to stand tall in
Walking in my father's shoes
Yes I'm stumbling and falling
Trying to stand tall in
Walking in my father's shoes"
"Nobody knows, nobody ever knows
No one ever knows that things won't stay the same.
She's in love with you, and you know you love her, too.
There will come a time when she won't know your name
Chorus:
There's a lot of things that die
Every time a day goes by
There's a lot of things that people can't explain.
You can be in love today
Meaning every word you say
Knowing when tomorrow comes the words you say
Will be a lie....
Nobody knows, nobody ever knows
No one knows that love must go away.
We played the games, never really understood
Never really understood the games we play
Chorus
Repeat first verse"
"Well I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought to
They pass quicker like when I was a child
[Chorus]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time
[Chorus]"
"Richard Fagan-Chris Clark
At the Christmas pot luck dinner
At the Holy Roller Hall
They don't allow no drinkin
Of any alch-ee-hol
So my Aunt Hazel makes a juice
Without the use of liquor
And every year
It seems to disappear
A little quicker
CHORUS
It's Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch
Guaranteed to spread some Christmas cheer
Fill the cup
And drink it up
It doesn't take too much
Of Hazel's homemade Hallelujah Punch
When everyone's done eatin'
And they're had a glass or two
The strangest things start happenin'
Just like they always do
The spirit of the season
Flows throughout the congregation
There must be some magic in that bowl
To cause such a sensation
CHORUS
She swears there's nothing in it
But the juice of fruits and berries
Some raisins, dates, a few yeast cakes, and maraschino cherries
She corks up two five-gallon jugs
And seals them every spring
And when she opens them up for Christmas
The cheer starts to sing
Ah
HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH
Hallelujah punch
Aunt Hazel makes
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
An amazing punch
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You'll hurl your lunch
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
If you drink too much
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And every sip tastes better and better
And better
And better
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
CHORUS
Hazel's homemade Hallelujah punch"
"Saw your picture on a poster in a cafe out in Phoenix
Guess you're still the sweetheart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home
And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind
But, oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Well, Old Red, he's getting older and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey, she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know
Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all
But then sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure you're gonna know the cost
'Cause for everything you win, there's somethin' lost
But, oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Everything that glitters is not gold"
"Who started this? I don't know
You're already packed and ready to go
I hope she's worth it, after all we've been through
You're breakin' my heart but I have to be strong
So go right ahead, I'll get along
Just one thing, you better know it's true
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna wish you had me back
Late at night, when you're starin' at the stars above
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
Will she hold you close like I used to do
And think that look in your eyes is true?
Does she believe those words you used to say to me?
Do you even know how it makes me feel
To watch you throw away the dreams we built?
Well, I hope she's everything you ever need
'Cause you're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna wish you had me back
Late at night, when you're starin' at the stars above
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
There's no use wastin' words anymore
I know it's over, what are you waitin' for?
Just remember
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna wish you had me back
When you're lying there, starin' at the stars above
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love
You're gonna miss a whole lotta love"
"I can be your midnight ""are you up?"" every time that he does, he does you like he does
I can let you dry your tears, tell you what you wanna hear,
but when you've had enough,
baby I, I can be that shot of whiskey, your memory Novocain
I can be the sunshine shining through the rain
let me be the on addiction running in your veins,
you don't have to hurt no more
baby I can ease your pain

I can't read your mind, girl its up to you
We can take the edge off, if that's what's you wanna do
Bring your misery .. lay it all on me
You don't need no 100 proof
Baby I am
I can be that shot of whiskey, your memory Novocain
I can be the sunshine shining through the rain

you don't have to hurt no more

"Invisible tears in my eyes incredible pain in my heart
Indestructible memories are passing in review
Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you
You're back again so I'll let you in
Although I'm only stealing pictures from the past
Those arms are not real but somehow I feel
If I'd just close my eyes then maybe it will last
Invisible tears in my eyes...
Invisible tears in my eyes..."
"Coffee keeps me up and I can't sleep
And when I drink too much then I can't eat
Losing you has led me to believe
Everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' me
I guess I made a big mistake
Thinkin' you're a habit I can break
Well, I'm addicted to you now I see
Everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love is killin' me
Cigarettes, Jack Daniels and caffeine
And that's the way you're turnin' out to be
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' me
Everything I love gonna have to give up
Cause everything I love is killin' me"
"Pretty soon we're gonna be all alone on our honeymoon
In some little secret hideaway place for two
That's the day you're gonna be all mine on our honeymoon
And that's when we'll find heaven for me and you
I'm gonna love you love you gonna turtle dove you
Squeeze you tease you tell you how I love you
Kiss you like you never been kissed before
And then we're walkin' talkin' spoon neath the moonlight
Arm in arm like lovers on the June night
Then I'll hug and kiss you some more
I can hardly wait for that happy day it can't be too soon
Till we cuddle and we snuggle on our honeymoon
[ guitar - steel ]
I'm gonna love you love you..."
"You wanted to know that you could break my heart but I could have told you you could
You just had to see if I'd go to pieces but I could have told you I would
Just think of the time not to mention the trouble
That you threw away on a heart like mine
If you just have to prove that you could destroy me I could have saved you the time
[ steel ]
And so now you know that I can be foolish but I could have told you it's true
And so now you see that I have a glass heart but I could have told you I do
There may come a time you may run into trouble
You might find the need for a love like mine
If you're wondering which fool will be waiting for you I could have saved you the time"
"I'd like you for Christmas
Please make my wish come true
'Cuz I'd trim trees and deck the hallways
If I knew you'd be mine for always
I won't be blue on christmas
If old Saint Nick comes through
And remembers that I'd like you for Christmas,
New Years, Easter, too
We'd like you for Christmas
Please make our wish come true
We'd trim trees and deck the hallways
If we knew you'd be ours for always
I wont be blue on Christmas
If old Saint Nick comes through
and he remembers that I'd like you
for Christmas, New Years, Easter, too
New Years, Easter, too"
"I Believe in Life, love and true pursuit of happiness
No ones gunna tell me that a smiles' ever meaningless
I find a drop of hope when the rain falls down
Even when the clouds are insisting on sticking around
I believe in holding on tight to your innocence
Taking leaps of faith when it doesn't even make sense
Don't wanna be a tear on a circus clown
I wanna laugh like a kid on the play ground
Baby come on lets go for a ride,
I know a road that'll change your mind
Look what it's done to this heart of mine
I'm an absolute dedicated follower of Sunshine
I used to be a slave to the ways of the shades of gray
Addicted to the weight of a ball and chain
Everybody telling me to cut it loose
Then I looked up to the sky and saw something I could use
A little bit of prayer a little bit of inspiration
A little something different like a new vibration
Shook me up like a leaf in a hurricane
Woke me up like a fall from an air plane
Baby come on lets go for a ride
I know a road that'll change your mind
Look what it's done to this heart of mine
I'm an absolute dedicated follower of sunshine
Yeah-eah
Oo-oo
Baby come on lets go for a ride
I know a road that'll change your mind
Look what it's done to this heart of mine
I'm an absolute dedicated follower of sunshine
I Believe in Life, love and true pursuit of happiness

Absolute dedicated follower of sunshine

"You'll find me hanging around it's where I'll be found down on the corner of love
Neath the stars that shine and the neon signs I'll be down on the corner of love
When I start to ball and love starts to call down on the corner of love
You'll find me hanging around it's where I'll be found down on the corner of love
When it's late in the evenin' and I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a stealin' neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down and moon comes around I'll be down on the corner of love
When you're passin' by too lonely to cry down on the corner of love
Just stop for a while I'll teach you to smile down on the corner of love
Ever love that you had has treated you bad down on the corner of love
Forget what you knew we'll start life anew down on the corner of love
When it's late in the evenin'
When it's late in the evenin'"
"I've been rained on I've been wind blown
Took a wrong road every now and then
I've been passed up once or twice stuck
And I thought love was just around the bend
But lately my hope was wearing thin
It's a lonesome and endless highway I've been searching for so long
After all the miles I've travelled loving you's like coming home
I've been left flat I've been laughed at
Wound up right back where I started from
Been the wrong way down a one way
And I thought some day my day would come
But lately I'd almost given up
It's a lonesome and endless highway...
Well I've been flagged down I've been turned round
And all that I found was a dead end street
I've been stranded marked and branded
Treated underhanded by everyone I meet
But lately my dream is gettin' weak
'Cause it's a lonesome and endless highway...
It's a lonesome and endless highway..."
"Well, it could be anywhere in the U.S.A.
Texas, Tennessee down in F.L.A.
When the weekend falls and all the girls come out
Well, that's what a country boys life is all about
Well, there's a band or a jukebox everywhere we go
Get in the car turn up the radio
Country music playing out in the streets
Everybody's dancin' to the cowboy beat
Well way out west they get a burning desire
When the guitars play it really feeds the fire
Arizona California down the Vegas way
They're even feeling the beat through the heat of the day
You know they're fallin' in love all over this land
From Alaska to the Rio Grande
So hold on to your baby while you move your feet
Everybody's dancin' to the cowboy beat
Well, they're sellin' like hotcakes everywhere we go
Showing up in honky tonks and rodeos
Twangin' and a kickin' on the movie screens
Lord it's takin' over everything
Well it could be anywhere in the U.S.A
Texas, Tennessee down in F.L.A
Way up in New York City at the Broadway show
They're wearin' boots and buckles while they do si do
You know they're bringin' the whole world down to its knees
So move a little closer and hold on to me
We'll dance down the isle life'll be so sweet
Raisin' our kids to the cowboy beat
To the cowboy beat
We'll be dancin' to the cowboy beat"
"If somebody would've told me
One woman could hold me
And leave me weak as a baby
I'd have told 'em they were crazy
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I used to play it so cool
Lord knows that I was no fool
No chains would ever bind me
But those days are all behind me-
you see
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I never saw love's power
Just the hearts and the flowers
When I fell it was frightening
It struck me down like lightning-
when
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
I used to live like a rolling stone
Nobody had a hold on me
All it took was a kiss from you
To bring me right to my knees
Love hit me like a
ten pound hammer
A ten pound hammer
with a five foot swing
Yeah, that's all she wrote"
"(Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in)
I'd rather live a life of lies and fantasy
Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving me
You built me up so high my heart can't stand the fall
And life without your love just isn't life at all
So walk out backwards if you must go
And please don't wave goodbye just wave one last hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can't just pretend
So walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in
You walked into my heart in search of sympathy
And from that day down to this you've walked all over me
And now you're walking out to find somebody new
But you're not by yourself cause my heart's leaving too
Walk out backwards
Walk out backwards and I'll think you're walking in"
"Last night was the worst night of my life no doubt
Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
While I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
[ steel ]
Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light
Did they miss me like I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands..."
"It's a source of speculation
Mornin' noon and night
Who is and who isn't
Which way's wrong and which way's right
I might try to describe the actual feelin'
But I don't have a clue
And if the truth be known darlin'
Neither do you
'Cause I been watchin' the whole rigamarol
For a long time now
Seems to be nothing written in stone
About where and why and how
Love takes it's willing victims
And turns 'em upside down
It's all bar-b-que sauce and mud and
Guts and finger paintin' the town
It's the strongest attraction in the universe
Ain't nothin' better baby, ain't nothing worse
Study after study, nobody understands
The gravitational pull between a woman and a man
It'll knock you down then lift you up
It'll make you dizzy and take your common sense
Or it'll plant your feet on solid ground
And fill your empty heart as a consequence
Her words will make you thirsty
Yearn to drink from her deep well
His tears will burn you like hot lava
Make you feel like
It's the strongest attraction in the universe
Ain't nothin' better baby, ain't nothing worse
Study after study, nobody understands
The gravitational pull between a woman and a man
So when it comes to you and me baby
And the kinda love we've fallen in
I ain't much interested in betty crocker
Without a dash of mae west thrown in
I want to go outside and dance around with you
Barefoot in the pourin' rain
Sparks flyin' from the telephone poles
Neighbors swearin' we're insane
It's the strongest attraction in the universe
Ain't nothin' better baby, ain't nothing worse
Study after study, nobody understands
The gravitational pull between a woman and a man"
"Seems like only yesterday we fell in love just barely old enough to be sincere
Back then I thought I loved you all I could
But I've grown to love you more through the years
Through the years I've had you to keep me happy
Hand in hand we face tomorrow with no fear
Side by side we've walked the road of life together
And each step has grown us closer through the years
Now we've raised all our children and they're gone once again you and I are all alone
But I never will be lonely while you're here
Cause we've got a love that's lasted through the years
Through the years...
And each step has grown us closer through the years"
"The honeymoon is over
The honeymoon is over
Back in the dance halls again
Back in the dance halls again
The kids are all so violent
The kids are all so violent
I'm a fool for the latest trends
I'm a fool for the latest trends
Robitussin and an 808
Slow dancing, with a stranger's date
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be back again
The girls in strange attire
I really love Richard Pryor
I don't care about anything
Smooth jazz in the evening
In the room you made a mess
On the floor is a cocktail dress
I always thought I was born
To die young and blow a horn
A line of K and a diet Sprite
Take my hand, lets drift through this night
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to good
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be back"
"I've been waiting here for her for my sentence
And I haven't said a word of anger here
And I didn't see her running till it hit me
She's been livin' right behind me all these years
I never found an ending to my suffering
She opened every door I should have closed
With the mercy of a hundred hungry animals
Sorrow she shows dressed in crinolines and bows
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight?
I studied every wrinkle on the pillow at my head
And sucked the sunken breath from deep within
She carved it to the body of my memory and said
""Let not your sorrows die though I am dead""
And I'm living with her now inside the temple
She moves enough to let my patience grow
And then I hear the ringing in the tower
Sorrow she shows dressed in crinolines and bows
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight?
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
(sorrow my baby)
I know what I know
Can we fall apart together tonight?
Can we fall apart together?"
"You're home with me one hour of the day you're in my arms one hour of the night
In the morning in the evening one little kiss
Seems to me there ought to be more to love than this
Your coffee cup tells the story much too much
Half a cup left yet it's warmer than your touch
You read the papers wave goodbye throw me a kiss
Seems to me there ought to be more to love than this
Seems to me there ought to be the sound of little feet on the floor
Instead of mine they hardly know where to goin' anymore
If love has meaning then I wonder oh just where it is
Seems to me there ought to be more to love than this"
"Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Put a song of love and laughter on your face
Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Cause the way you're talkin' now is a digrace
I've heard enough o' your talk about the world that is to be
You say it's sick and sinful and then any fool should see
You sing songs of agitation and usin' funny rhymes
The whole new trend and your preachin' friend is a great big waste of time
Talk me some sense talk me some sense
Just call me a illiterate or any other name
But no matter how you bug me up I'll tell you without shame
Don't know where your world is but it sounds quite a mess
But here on earth we waste our time on things like happiness
Talk me some sense talk me some sense"
"If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again"
"If I had a bird, a little bird
I would teach that bird to sing your name
Prettiest song that you have ever heard
And your indifferent heart I will claim
So be off, my little bird
Fly away, fly away
And when my love you see
Only then, my little bird
Cry away, cry away, and bring that heart to me
If I had a moon in the sky
I would light the world and pull the tide
And when the moon is full like my heart
It will surely pull you to my side
But in the darkest night I pine away
Pine away until your face I see
So throw your light, my lovely moon
Shine away, shine away, and pull his heart to me
If I had a wagon made of gold
Pretty painted horses numbered four
With a silver harness I would hitch them up
And drive that wagon to your door
And if my hand you choose to hold
Ride away, ride away with the pretty horses four
But, darlin', if you heart's still cold
Hide away, hide away till trouble you no more
Trouble you no more"
"Skippin' rocks, skippin' rope
Laughin' at all my best friends jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street
Things have changed a lot but I never did
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die
Livin' right, livin' in this little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams
Standin' proud, standin' tall
Standin' smack dab in the middle of it all
I don't worry 'bout things that I can't change
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die
And everything around me are
Things I dearly love
And every night I get on my knees and thank
The lord above
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die"
"I know you're going, I know this is goodbye
And I can't make you stay no matter how hard I try
And ooh, if your leaving, please grant me this one request
And leave my heart with some happiness
If this is the last kiss
Let's make it last all night
If this is the last time that I'm ever gonna hold you
Let me hold you tight 'til the morning light
If this is the last time, ooh, we?ll ever be together
Then kiss me and baby, give me something to remember you by
Pull down the shades
Put your heart next to mine
Tonight, give me a chance to feel heaven just one more time
And ooh, if your leavin?, well honey, I?ll set you free
Just leave my arms with one sweet memory
If this is the last kiss
Let's make it last all night
If this is the last time that I'm ever gonna hold you
Let me hold you tight 'til the morning light
If this is the last time, ooh, we?ll ever be together
Then kiss me and baby, give me something to remember you by
If I can't be with you, baby, all my life
The next best thing is you next to me all through the night
If this is the last kiss
Let's make it last all night
If this is the last time that I'm ever gonna hold you
Let me hold you tight 'til the morning light
If this is the last time, ooh, we?ll ever be together
Then kiss me and baby, give me something to remember you by"
"Ugh...
I saw you last night with your handsome new dude
Kissing and smiling last night
I would rather have poisoned beaked sparrows
Pluck out my cryin' eyes
One of us has got to go, babe
One of us has got to go...
How it pains me to tell you so, babe
One of us has got to go...
One of us has got to go...
I climbed to the top of the Golden Gate bridge...
But, I forgot I'm afraid of heights
I put bullets in the pistol put that pistol in my mouth...
But, the barrel just didn't taste right
One of us has got to go, babe
One of us has got to go...
How it pains me to tell you so, babe
One of us has got to go...
One of us has got to go...
No suicide for the courage of a coward...
And one of us has got to go
Sitting here outside your window thinking...
One of us has got to go
You don't see me but I can see you...
And one of us has got go
With the hammer pulled back my finger shakes on the trigger...
And one of us has got to go
You smile so true while he's rubbing on you...
And one of us has got to
One is not enough and three is to many...
And one of us has got to...
Boom!"
"Girl getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Yeah, first of all we came here to forget
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with you before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget"
"Misery and gin
Here I am drunk again
And gone gone gone
Man I hate these songs
Silver wings
And old lonesome memory
The music plays on
I hate these songs
[Chorus]
Cause I sit in my car
And I bathe in their sorrow
Try to wash away my pain
Just to get through tomorrow
Note by note
Line by line
It cuts to the bone
Man I hate these songs
Crazy four walls
He stopped loving her today
And old lonely street
Ain't it funny how time slips away
And born to loose
Am I losing you
I'm just hanging on
Man I hate these songs
[Chorus]
The music plays on
Man I hate these songs"
"If you need someone to take you by the hand
And help you heal your broken heart
Show you how to find the faith in love again
So you can make a brand new start
If you're looking for the man to chase away your clouds
And be your morning sun
Oh, baby I'm the one
Believing in tomorrow is so hard
When all your yesterdays are filled with pain
Trusting in the future isn't easy
When the past is just pouring rain
All you need it someone to take away
The memory of what he's done
Oh, baby I'm the one
I'm the one who longs to kiss your lips
And hold you tight
I'm the one who longs to love you
For the rest of your life
So if you're looking for the kind of man who loves
Forever and will never run
Oh, baby I'm the one
I'm the one who longs to kiss your lips
And hold you tight
I'm the one who longs to love you
For the rest of your life
So if you're looking for the kind of man who loves
Forever and will never run
Oh, baby I'm the one
Oh, baby I'm the one"
"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream"
"Everyone has heard me say I don't miss her much today
Cause there's so much more to do than sit and cry
I said many times before I don't love her anymore but to tell the truth I told a lie
It feels so good to get it off my conscience to admit that she's still on my mind
I've tried keeping inside all the bitter tears I've cried
Oh I just laughed it up or at least I gave it a try
Oh when I thought I was at my best I sat and thought of her less and less
But to tell the truth I told a lie
It feels so good to get it off my conscience to admit that she's still on my mind
When I thought I was at my best"
"Three hearts in a tangle one heart will have to break
Tonight as I sit by my window watching the people go by
I'm trying to reach a decision but I know I can't do what's right
Three hearts in a tangle which heart should I take
Three hearts in a tangle which heart will I break
If I choose the one that I should choose then the other heart would break
But if I'll leave them both then I'd suffer which heart will pay for my mistake
Three hearts in a tangle..."
"Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now and never sayin' what they mean
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da la da da da
People walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
Then they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da la da da da
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity and you don't give a da da da
Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la da da da"
"You always hurt the one you love the one you shouldn't turn at all
You always take the sweetest rose and crash it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart with hasty words you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night it's because I love you most of all
You always break the kindest heart"
"Before you take another step there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
Then there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me
[Steel]
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure that's what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansion..."
"Oh I've come to the point where I've had one too many
And one short of having too few
Oh my bottle of freedom is one drink from empty
And I'm back down to hung up on you
I come here to escape and some say too often
But not as much as I would like to
Cause as high as I get is how low I'll be fallin'
Oh back down to hung up on you
Feeling nothing at all for awhile sure feels better
Than the hurtin' you're puttin' me through
But as sure as I am of the sunrise tomorrow
I'll be back down to hung up on you
[ steel ]
Feeling nothing at all...
Yes as sure as I am of the sunrise tomorrow
I'll be back down to hung up on you"
"Tudo errado
Eu joguei
Os meus sonhos pro alto
No momento em que te deixei
Quatro anos de paix?o
S? serviram pra mostrar
Que n?o se brinca com o cora??o
E o desespero bate forte...
Te envio nossas fotos das f?rias em Salvador
Te mando mil mensagens pra falar do meu amor
N?o durmo mais na cama, pois seu cheiro ali est?
A solid?o n?o quer mais me deixar
Procuro em outros olhos encontrar o brilho seu
No som do carro ainda toca o CD que me deu
Simples detalhes de uma vida ? dois
O amor ficou s? que voc? se foi
Voc? se foi ...
Tudo errado
Jogo aberto
S? menti pra adiar o final que j? era certo
Aventura, sem sentido.
S? me fez perder voc?
Minhas l?grimas est?o caindo
E o desespero bate forte
Te envio nossas fotos das f?rias em Salvador
Te mando mil mensagens pra falar do meu amor
N?o durmo mais na cama pois seu cheiro ali est?
A solid?o n?o quer mais me deixar
Procuro em outros olhos encontrar o brilho seu
No som do carro ainda toca o CD que me deu
Simples detalhes de uma vida a dois
O amor ficou s? que voc? se foi
Voc? se foi ...
Filmagens, flashes, momentos.
Recorda??es tatuadas no peito
A gente pode voltar, deve haver algum jeito"
"Same old place
Same old city
What can I do?
I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around, oh Lord
I've got all this and Heaven above
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
I get a feeling in me
When I remember all those crazy days and crazier nights
Can't you hear the music playing?
You must have heard them saying
We're gonna rip 'em up and light up the night
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
Same old place
It's the same old city
What can I do?
I'm falling in love
I'm just an old hound dog
Roaming around, Lord, Lord
I've got all this and Heaven above
Oh, Atlanta
I hear you calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia
Oh, Atlanta
Hear me calling
I'm coming back to you one fine day, hey
No need to worry
There ain't no hurry cause I'm
On my way back to Georgia
On my way back to Georgia"
"That night will live forever
Their first time to lie together
They were finally where desire dared them to go
Both belonging to another
But longing to be lovers
Promising each other that the night will only know
Parked on some old backstreet
They laid down in the back seat
And fell into the fire down below
But they would pay for their deceiving
For a deadly web was weaving
Why they picked that spot that evening
Lord, the night will only know
Well within the innuendos
Just outside the steamy windows
The night was shattered by a woman's scream
Motionless and frightened
The grip of fate had tightened
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam
They saw a woman pleading
Stumbling, begging and retreating'
Til she became the victim of her foe
And they watched her fall in silence
To save their own alliance
But the reason for the violence
Just the night will only know
And every paper ran the story
She was stripped of all her glory
And the told exactly how the woman died
Abandoned and forsaken
Too many pills were taken
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide
Bound by their behavior
They could have been her savior
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe
But another crime was committed
And it's never been admitted
Have the guilty been acquitted
Lord, the night will only know"
"Sit by my side come as close as the air sharing a memory of grey
And wander in my words and dream about the pictures that I play of changes
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall to brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die trapped within the circle time parade of changes
Moments of magic will glow in the night all fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes
Passions will part to a warm melody as fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind we're puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes"
"I've slipped around, dear, two-timing you
Having fun now, like some guys do
But now I'm sorry and now I'm true
Forgive me, darling, its up to you
Well I don't blame you if you two-time, too
Because I'm guilty for the things I do
I've slipped around, love, played every game
And if you leave me I'll take the blame
I ain't got much money, I'm just a pauper guy
Trying to go on, dear without your love, I'll die
So please don't leave me, whatever you do
Just squeeze me, darling, while I'm loving you"
"She didn't have to marry down so far
[Incomprehensible] with raising babies or driving older car
She didn't have to give so much and be so underpaid
Lord, I don't know how she's living with the choices she made
She didn't have to wear those bargain threads
[Incomprehensible] those dandy hands, moping floors and changing beds
She had a sweet on easy street, with her hand she could have played
But she threw out all her aces for the choices she made
She'll stand there in defiance of a logic she ignored
The springs lay peaceful smile upon her face
Using up her youth on some old cowboy
Would finally pay the bills on hope and faith
Time goes by, it doesn't change a thing
But she still thinks it's worth it all to wear that little ring
And I still lay beside her wishing I was worth the price she paid
All teary eyed and thankful for the choices she made"
"Well it's rainin out on Rebecca Street
And I aint doin that well
I was gonna do a whole lot better this time
That's what I told myself
And I'm waiting for the lights to change
These days they never do
And all the girls on Rebecca street
Look by you
I saw Katie Kinkade
She said to say hello
And she said she was sorry
When I told her the story
She said that she didn't know
Funny how she's wearing her hair these days
The same way you used to
And all the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you
And every magazine
And every mezzanine
Is starin right back at me
And everywhere I go
Everybody that I know
Every picture on TV
And the light used to turn from red to green
But these days they just turn blue
And all of the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you
And all of the girls on Rebecca street
Look like you"

"I'm Gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna buy me a dance,
first lovely lady that I see,
And when the dance is through
I'll say, ""will you marry me""
I'm gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around
I'm gonna find me a game,
Of hold 'em if I can,
and fold 'em all night long,
til I got me a hand
I'm gonna buy us a ranch,
With a Palomino Herd
And I won't mean no harm,
babe and I won't say a word.
When misery comes to call,
A gift to him, my life
I'll sit with him awhile,
and share my horse, my hole, my wife
I'm gonna shine up my boots,
I'm gonna go into town,
I'm gonna scrape up 20 dollars,
I'm gonna throw it around.
I'm gonna buy me a dance,
first lovely lady that i see,
and when the dance is through,
I'll say ""will you marry me"""
"A scarecrow and yellow moon and road house on the edge of town
Hear that midnight rooster crow well I have one more before I go
But Honey don't turn out the light cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
The night is cool beneath the stars I'm ridin' home in John's old car
Got my head out in the wind here I am drunk up again
But Honey don't turn out the light cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
Me and John in a pickup truck a bottle of gin and a paper cup
Runnin' wild and livin' hard and I passed out in our front yard
But Honey don't turn out the light cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
The moon is high the sun is down honey came out in her old night gown
On a porch at a quarter o'three talkin' to the deputy sheriff and me
But Honey don't turn out the light cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
I said honey don't turn out the light cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight"
"Days pass me by just like moments
They're here and then they're gone
For good, for good
I work so hard at where I'm going
I wonder what I've missed
I can't remember the last time
I picked up the phone just to talk
For hours on end
Or sent a birthday card un-belated
Maybe I should slow down
Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal
I've always got a big to-do list
Oh, but there's so much more to do
To see I want to
Know that I didn't leave 'I love you's'
Trapped within my heart
There won't always be another day to
Say all the things you want to say
So don't, don't wait
Wait for the perfect moment
It will never come around
Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal
When the show is over
And they lay me down
I wanna be remembered
For the love I spread around
Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone
So I'm gonna do my best
And make the most of it, avoid regrets
Take a breath, realize
Time is irreversible
This ain't no dress rehearsal
This ain't no dress rehearsal"
"I want a lasting love that's guarantee to stay
I'm tired of having fun just loving anyone
Not more and good be holding hands with me when midnight comes
It may seem all right then but when it's said and done
This old heart of mine is right back where it started from
I want a lasting love no more goodbye love
I'm through with temporary love that's undependable
Goodbye to yesterdays hello to better days
I want a lasting love that's guarantee to stay
I've truly had my share of insincere affair
Yet that's same old emptiness inside it's always there
I'm glad I've finally seen a change just had to be
Here today and gone tomorrow love is not for me
I want a lasting love...
I want a lasting love that's guarantee to stay"
"You have painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is goin' down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
For it wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
Oh I know Ruby that I'm not the man I used to be but Ruby I still need your company
And she's leaving now cause I've just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
If I could move I get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town don't take your love to town"

"Living down here they throw me down and count me
I'm making this up, it keeps my feathers clean
And the black boys they kick my ass and tell me
That the women their ruby lips are dry.
I get angry and I get sad
And I lose this sweetness that I used to have
And I boil my strings
To get them back to gold
Sleeping in here they give me plenty to eat
Don't make trouble, make something with the concrete
So I fill my pipes with it to break them black boys heads
Lord, but I wish I had a gun."
"I'm a rock nobody can roll
You say I got a heart as solid as stone
I ain't lonely, just alone
Yeah and I like it that way
I've been burned with ashes before
I don't play with matches no more
Keep those flames far from my door
The thrill is gone anyway
And then you come around
And everything changes
My will gets weak
And the crazy thing is
All you do is smile
And there I go
Showin' my tender side
Showin' my tender side
I can walk and I can talk tough
I say that you can look
But you better not touch
And I swear I've had it with love
Yeah, only fools fall for that
But then you come around
And everything changes
My will gets weak
And the crazy thing is
All you do is smile
And there I go
Showin' my tender side
Showin' my tender side
There's a part of me
The tender heart of me
That can't help but want to believe
Maybe you could be the one
'Cause when you come around
Everything changes
My will gets weak
And the crazy thing is
All you do is smile
And there I go
Showin' my tender side
I keep showin' my tender side
I keep showin' my tender side

"You walked in with me but you walked out with someone else
And left me sitting here alone all by myself
I thought you were over him but I was wrong
My world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
They just keep playin' they don't notice you were gone
You walked right out on me while they played our favorite song
And before you reached the door my teardrops hit the floor
My world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
[ steel - fiddle ]
Well you said you'd forgotten him and no more did you care
But when we walked in your eyes lit up as you saw him sitting there
Well he asked you to dance and just like that you were gone
And my world stopped but the band keeps playin' on
They just keep playin'.."
"We use to pull off highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go hide on a Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Sonebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"". and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs
[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage of that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs
There was always a line stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singing it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feeling of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinking songs we could do 'em all night long
But the ones i remember the most
[Chorus]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs
[Chorus]
Always the love songs
Always the love songs"

With a wink of your eye,
Ya make it all right

Let me take you along for the ride
ain't nothin' that stays the same
Won't ask it a' you
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose

Oh ya taught me this much, Mona Lisa

For for when you need remindin'
ain't nothin' that stays the same
Won't ask it a' you
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose"
"Daylight falls
And I'm lost in the big parade
Hold my hand, darling
I'm afraid of the daylight
Shade is dark
Cool and languid for life or long
Safe in shadow,
It's never as dark as the daylight
As the daylight
When I was just knee high
My momma told me never try to be
Someone that I am not
Yet over time I had forgot
A wandering child, so lost at play
He's found himself,
But he can't find his way
In the daylight, oh the daylight
Oh daylight, oh daylight
Life is short
And there's no turning back the time
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb
In that daylight
In my mind
There's a corner I need to turn
Lessons left is a lesson learned
In the daylight
In the daylight
I miss the forest shade
That took me there
The promise I made
Can never leave the dark so dear
Safe and soothing yet I fear
As I recall and I reflect
I see it's safer to connect
To the daylight
Oh the daylight
Oh daylight, oh daylight
Daylight falls
And I'm lost in the big parade
Hold my hand darling, I'm afraid
Of the daylight, of the day ..."
"I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
We can do some livin'
or spend our whole lives hopin'
In the end we're left with
The ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open"
"Hey it was bumper to bumper on the town square
Windows rolled down feel the summer air
We would bark the tires peeling outta there
To make the girls stare, make the girls stare
Drive from the Sonic across the railroad tracks
Down to the mall then make your way back
Take your Route 44 coke and pour out half
Make room for Jack, fill it up with Jack and it was
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this town
Hot little honey climbing up on in my truck
Rolling along sitting shotgun
Look like a firecracker coming undone
Make your heart jump, jump, jump, like
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this town
And every time I come back here
It takes me back to the years
When we would drive around and around
And around and around singing
Oh oh
Yeah, were kings and queens
Oh oh
Cruising South Jackson Street
Oh oh
Riding up and down that all night merry go round
Oh oh
Just more of the same old same
Oh oh
Making memories with time to waste
Oh oh
And it ran out we took
One last lap around this town"
"If you're afraid to touch my hand,
That's all right I understand,
All the changes you been through,
I've been rained on to,
You don't know you can't be sure
Believe me I've been there before,
Trust in me that's all you do,
I've been rained on to.
Like you I really loved some one,
Only to be walked upon,
By that lonely look I see,
You've been rained on just like me,
But I have made it through the storm
I know where you're coming from,
I'll take special care of you,
Cause I've been rained on to.
Music
Like you I really loved some one,
Only to be walked upon,
By that lonely look I see,
You've been rained on just like me,
But I have made it through the storm
I know where you're coming from,
I'll take special care of you,
Cause I've been rained on to.
I've been rained on to."
"If I pour your cup, that is friendship
If I add your milk, that is manners
If I stop there, claiming ignorance of taste,
That is tea
But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love,
But if I measure the sugar
To satisfy your expectant tongue
Then that is love,
Sitting untouched and growing cold"
"Do you know how glad I am to be in love with you
For the first time in my life I've found a love that's true
Can you feel the my heart speaking to you
It's so hard to tell you it's like a wall you see right through
Thanks for reading my mind
You know just what need to say
Time after time before the moments slip away
When I'm lost for words you say the very ones that I can't find
Thanks for reading my mind
Do you feel what I feel when we're making love
A thousand words can be heard with just a simple touch
When there's only silence do you understand
And you reach for my hand it's so good to know of course you can
Thanks for reading my mind
You know just what need to say
Time after time before the moments slip away
When I'm lost for words you say the very ones that I can't find
Thanks for reading my mind
Thanks for reading my mind
You know just what need to say
Time after time before the moments slip away
When I'm lost for words you say the very ones that I can't find
Thanks for reading my mind"
"Well, I can feel your heartbeat when your lying by my side
I can see foever when I look into your eyes
Each day beside you, girl you take my breath away
Right here in your arms is where I wanna stay
It's the way that you look girl
When you're reading late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
Watching you walk in
yeah, you're dancing through your world
Got your heart on my hands 'cause you're daddy's bittle girl
Baby, I've loved you from our very first hello
At first, you stole my heart, baby, here's my soul
It's the way that you look girl
When you're readying late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
I never knew love could be so sweet
I never knew, girl, that you could love me
But I'll spend each day just to make your dreams come true
'Cause it's just you and me
Baby, it's me and you
It's the way that you look girl
When you're reading late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
It's just you and me, baby
It's you and me, darlin'
its you and me and girl your all i need"
"She still sits out on the range
Sun sets, she looks like a rose in the rain
Waiting and praying he's coming again
He rode like the breath of Nero
A real man - laid down his life for a friend
Fought for her life to the bitter end
And she won't care how long or where or when
She still believes he's coming 'round the bend
Until the last real cowboy rides again
She's saving all her sun sets until then love never ends
Six years since he's been gone
Some say they heard her calling her name
Dancing with him through the window pane
It can't be she must be crazy
Must be that she's got a heart that won't mend
But I think she visits him in the wind
When a cool breeze is rushing through her hair
There's one hand on her heart
The other she's waving in the air"
"He's not lookin' for your kind of love
I got a hand in his heart like a fist in a glove
You say you're strong
Well, tough you better be
When he's lookin' for a fight he
Always comes back to me
[Chorus]
'Cause one good lover deserves another
I'm one good lover, one good lover
He's just lookin' for a friendly smile
He got a look in his eye like
A Prisoner with a file
He don't love you, he don't even know your name
It takes two to tango
Three to lose the game
[Chorus]
Try it one more time with feeling
But you can't hurt him like I can
Like I can
Like I can
One good lover deserves another
He's not lookin' for your kind of love
He likes a take and a give, likes a pull and a shove
You're experienced, advice is what you need
Listen closely I've got two words for you for free
[Chorus]"
"Little one when you grow old
Keep alive these precious years
Remember all our fields of gold
And the silver of my tears
Little one when shadows falls
And the time for my departure nears
Say a prayer and gather all
The silver of my tears
Tears of joy and thankfulness
From the wealth of love inside
Shining in the eyes you bless
Are tears to sweet to hide
While you live
Apart of me
Will be with you
Through out the years
Shining in your eyes
Will be
The silver of my tears"
"Whistle, midnight screaming
Cross a squeaking trestle
Lonesome whistle
Hobo, tin cup, drink up
Bedroll, good ol' hobo
Where did they all go
Gone but not forgotten
Cowboys, riding, roping
Real cow poking cowboys
Where are you now boys
Heroes, good guys, white hat
Fist fight, take that heroes
It's hard to find those
Gone but not forgotten
The wheels of time just keep on moving on
Too many things we love too soon are gone
But not forgotten
Daddy, strong back, rough hands
Soft heart, good man, Daddy
I miss you, Daddy
Gone but not forgotten
Yes, he's gone but not forgotten"
"She bloomed for me near a little village
In a cabin on the hill
We made our vows we'd love each other
And I know we always will
She's my rose of old Kentucky
I watched her bloom as the years roll by
And to me there'll never be another
I'll love her 'til the day I die
Oh in dreams I see my darling
In a gingham dress she looks so sweet
Oh I long for old Kentucky
And my darling was more to me
Oh I know you often wonder
So I'll tell you the reason why
She's my rose of old Kentucky
And I know she'll never lie"
"Talk to him everyday
Even though he's oh-so-far away
And every night I lay in bed
And hug the pillow where he laid his head
And in my dreams I drift back to that high school kiss
And the night he put his class ring on my hand
I see our wedding day and it takes my breath away
Once again, like it did back then
I'm living on the love her left me
And he gave me so much love in such a little time
And that kind of love is hard to find
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by
But till we're back together
I'm living on the love he left behind
Our little boy down the hall
Is trying to teach me how to play baseball
Yesterday, I got choked up
When he said, Mommy, You use daddy's glove
I turned down a thousand bucks
For his old pick-up truck
I'm hangin' on to everything that's part of him
I'll hold him in my heart
Till I can hold him in my arms
Once again
But till then
I'm living on the love her left me
And he gave me so much love in such a little time
And that kind of love is hard to find
One day we'll meet again in that sweet by-and-by
But till we're back together
I'm living on the love he left behind"
"You walked away from me and this child
I dried her tears last night
Gently I rocked her while I quietly cooed
With a heart that won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Deep in the night our baby screamed
She sought for mommy to come
I told her I hoped that daddy will do
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Now here you stand pleading with me
You ask if I can forgive
My mind is shouting not to try to
But my heart won't stop loving you
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
What will it change if I take you back
How can I know you'll try
I can't let go of the good times we had
Tell me, have your feelings died
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
I'm feeling helpless, I do
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I've got a heart that won't stop loving you
Why did you leave, I'm so confused
I got a heart that won't stop loving you"
"Sunny yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh the dark days're done and the bright days're here
My Sunny one she's so sincere
Oh Sunny one so true I love you
Sunny I thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true I love you
Sunny thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true I love you
Sunny thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny thank you for the gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire you're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true I love you Sunny one so true I love you"
"Like red on a rose
When your lips first smiled at me
I was captured instantly
To each his own
Like blue in the sky
The gaze of your willing eyes
Touched something deep inside
And the truth be known
That I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you 'cause I know that
I can't do anything wrong
You're where I belong
Like red on a rose
And I love you
Like all little children love pennies
And I love you
Like good times of which
I've known many
And I love you
'cause I know you give me
A heart of my own
You make my blood flow
Like red on a rose"
"We got a bucket of Corona,
Enough stories to last all night,
About the trials and tribulations,
Of findin' Mr. Right:
Of findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The ""I love ya"" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Blind dates an' horror stories;
Pushy gals and fast movers.
Let's dedicate this girl's night out,
To big-talkers; bad losers,
It's so hard findin' a good man.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The ""I love ya"" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Julie, I know you want perfection;
Angie, you want a listener.
Lisa, your list is gettin' long,
And girls, you know me:I just want a good kisser.
Here's to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters;
To the Momma's boys who can't make a stand.
Here's to the superficial players;
The ""I love ya"" too-soon-sayers;
If you hear me girls, raise your hand:
Let's have a toast;
Let's have a toast:
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man.
Here's to findin' a good man."
"You're the end of the of the rainbow, my pot of gold
You're daddy's little girl to hand and hold
A precious gem is what you are
Your mommy's bright and shining star
You're the spirit of Christmas, my star on the tree
You're the Easter bunny to mommy and me
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice
And you're daddy's little girl
Like angels that sing a heavenly thing
And you're daddy's little girl"
"I was counting time, Marking days on the wall. I was sleeping late, when I woke up at dawn. Before I met you, I was clinging to the ground. I would sing my songs, just to see if I still made sound.
Save for you, I'm lost, and lonely.
Save for you, I'm a crumbling shack.
Save for you, I'm empty, and phony.
Save for you, I'm flat on my back, I'm a living artifact.
Guess I could get up, brush my teeth, comb my hair.
Call upon old friends, see a movie, get some air.
What could anyone say, that would matter anyhow?
I recall before you, that's where I am heading now.
Save for you, I'm lost, and lonely.
Save for you, I'm a crumbling shack.
Save for you, I'm empty, and phony.
Save for you, I'm flat on my back, I'm a living artifact.
I say you look pretty, you say I am man enough to carry the load,
isn't itty-bitty.
We drove home, when a drunk was on the road.
You were in my dream, though I never saw your face.
You're a reason to know, cause you still had the same grace.
It didn't need to be said, I knew just what I should do.
Next morning I started living, living big enough for two.
Save for you, I'm lost, and lonely.
Save for you, I'm a crumbling shack.
Save for you, I'm empty, and phony.
Save for you, I'm flat on my back, I'm under attack, I'm a living artifact."
"I'm only a dreamer of romance
My love dreams can never come true
I'll just pretend that I'm happy
And smile through these tears dear at you
I dreamed of a cabin of love dear
Where all of our dreams would come true
But another has taken my cabin
And left me so lonely and blue
Nestled around my cabin
That means all the world to me
Our love sweet heart will always linger
For you are a part dear of me
Where is the love we once cherished
Why didn't our love dreams come true
All I can do now is dream dear
Of a cabin sweetheart dear and you"
"Why must I love the heartless
One who'll never know the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room
But no one meets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on
These walls will hide me when I cry
And hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on"
"Well tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that
When you look out in the morning you might see
Clouds rollin' by like memories
And a big old sky above you lookin' back
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind
I can picture you in his arms tonight
But as for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
It may work for you
But I'm a little bluer than that
Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind
So tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that"
"GREAT GREAT DAY
(Bill Anderson)
'67 Moss Rose Publications
RECORDED BY DEL REEVES
There's gonna be a great great day
All of my troubles will pass away
I read the book and the book did say
Oh there's gonna be a great great day
On my back no more burdens
On my shoulders no more cares
In my heart no more sadness
And the bells of peace will ring out everywhere
Oh there's gonna be a great great day...
I'm gonna rest beside the waters
Fill my cup till it overflows
Oh how sweet just to see the sunshine
How I suffered in this world nobody knows
But there's gonna be a great great day...
Ah there's gonna be a great great day"
"Doctor, you ain't got a pill
For whatever's making this world ill
You can't get forgiveness at the store
And peace, it's a politician's war
You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle
In the stars or Aristotle, the only answer to the problem is...
People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Words aren't what they seem to be
Talk is cheap but lies are free
We fear what we don't understand
And we've been scared since time began
All the colors and the cultures circle 'round us on a spindle
It's a complicated riddle, the solution is so simple...
It's people loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
You can pawn it off on kings and queens and those behind the curtain
Say what can make a difference in a world so full of hurting
But I believe the remedy starts right here with you and me
People loving people
That's the enemy of everything's that's evil
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle
It's just people loving people
It's just people loving people
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
Whoa, woah, woah, woah
It's just people loving people"
"I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love
Every hour of the day you're all I'm a thinkin' of
All week along when you're gone I sit around so blue
I just can't wait on Saturday that's my holiday with you
Monday Tuesday Wednesday wonder if you miss me too
Thursday Friday Saturday making plans just to be with you
Oh I'm a gonna be so sweet to you neath the moon above
I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love
Well I'd like to make everyday with you...
I'd like to make everyday with you a holiday for love"
"All the boys he played cards with
Couldn't wait til he came
But they haven't seen him
Since I got his last name
He plays at home now
And he always wins
Those swingin' doors
Don't do nothin' for him
[Chorus]
Cause he don't do bars anymore
That ol' jukebox
Don't turn him on like before
We dance to our radio
On our own hardwood floor
No he don't do bars anymore
He used to sit on a bar stool
Keepin' sad company
Now he lays on the couch
And he watches TV
When he's wrapped up in my arms
He knows what he's found
So don't bother askin'
For him to come 'round
[Chorus]"
"Moon coming through the pines, cranking up a country song,
Heaven right by your side, and a Saturday night barely hanging on.
Sun shining through the stained glass, humming just as I am.
I'm praying that feeling would last, that feeling that saves you,
Makes you wanna raise your hands.
That's the way it was, and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did.
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go.
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know.
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row.
I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times, there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads, where momma saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls
That's the way it was, and that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and buck the way we did.
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go.
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know.
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row."
"When we first started on our way through love
We thought we were two of a kind
We thought forever was just you and me
And always a matter of time
Time has a way of changin' it's mind
We're givin' on each others heart
Our love grew till it ran out of room
Now it looks like we're growing apart
We had a mountain of our very own
That turned out we just couldn't climb
We've just been waiting for something to give
And we've been standing in line
Time has a way of changin' it's mind
We're givin' on each others heart
Our love grew till it ran out of room
Now it looks like we're growing apart"
"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are"
"I know you said when I left
I'd regret every word, every breathe, every step, every minute without you
Go do what you have to
I know I said you were wrong I'd move on
It was only a matter of time, til I'd make it without you
But this wasn't about you
I said I needed space, a change of place to go out and live my life
[Chorus]
I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
I admit I was wrong all along now you're gone with all that I'd been living for
I don't wanna live without you, anymore
For a couple of nights I was fine
I was high off the wine and the lights and my new found freedom, that I thought I needed
But that cold lonely room that I headed home to, it felt like a tomb
I just stared at the ceiling, what an empty feeling
And baby I, apologize, and tell me its not too late
[Chorus x2]
No, I don't wanna live without you, anymore"
"When you broke my heart, I wanted to
Cut the breakline on your four-wheel drive
And poison your Pabst Blue Ribbon
When you drug my name all through the mud
I was dying to do the same, but I held my tongue
'Cause that ain't Christian
And you might be laughing now
But what goes around comes around
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl, just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch, so I hope you have a daughter
When them boys pick her up wearing cheap cologne
Younger versions of yourself so you'll know when they drive off
What they're thinking
You had some real good lines and they will too
I bet you'll have a come-to-Jesus when they're being used
On your baby
And you'll want to kick their ass, but hey pot, that kettle's black
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
You get a little grayer every time you hear a knock
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch, so I hope you have a daughter
Yeah, it kind of makes me sad
That she'll be the one to get you back
So I hope you have a daughter and I hope that she's a fox
Daddy's little girl, just as sweet as she is hot
She can't help but love them boys
Who love to love and leave them girls just like her father
Yeah, karma's a bitch, so I hope you have a daughter
You son-of-a-bitch, I hope you have a daughter"
"I rolled off the Frisco mint in 1909
The last one they ever made, you should've seen me shine
When I landed on the counter they gave me to a kid
Making change for a jaw breaker was the first thing that I did
I got traded for a pocket knife, two marbles and some string
Wound up on a railroad track waiting for a train
Snatched up by a hobo and turned right into wine
Pitched up against the wall at least a thousand times
Round and round a penny goes
Round and back again
Listen and I'll tell you
The places that I've been
I was stolen from a banker by Pretty Boy Floyd and then
He gave me to a farmer who was trying to save his land
I was good luck to a soldier back in world war two
He lost me in a poker game the day the war was through
I got stuck behind the back seat of a '51 Chevrolet
Spare change in the sixties, getting worthless every day
Not it's piggy banks and gum machines and occasional wishing wells
Or laying on a bar room floor
As far and wide
So both of us can dare
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have to share
A chance to sail among the stars
That few will ever see
To feel the deepest missing you
That most think cannot be
A heart that beats for only one
And loves you fast and true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
These things I have to give to you
Their value isn't much
Just things that you can barely see
And rarely ever touch
A hand to hold when we're alone
And no one seems to care
A gentle touch to reassure
And tell you I'm still there
To try my best to reminisce
Our dreams that all come true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
My promise I will love and bide
This I give to you"
"The way you kissed me this morning
It told me that you soon would be going
You didn't even look in my eyes
When you said goodbye
And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises
That I knew you would never keep
Now I'm reading the letter which you placed on the dresser
And you're five hundred miles down the road
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced
Yeah, I remember when we said 'forever'
Was the craziest word that we knew
But I think that I like it much better than I do 'goodbye'
And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons
Why you are not by my side
Instead I'll go to the kitchen, find a strong chair to sit in
And drink myself far, far away
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced"
"Someone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must've fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant
Oh, I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I'd been feeling over you
But they said it really loud and said it on the air
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...
Now don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be coming home real soon
Oh... he kinda a made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it for yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really mean
'Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh...
Now if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
He found he really lied he said he really lied
On the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh... on the radio
Oh..."
"He'll buy you lots of pretty things fancy clothes and fancy rings
But he will never love you never more than I
Your pillard home all dressed in white will be cold on the summer's night
Cause he will never love you never more than I
Wealth and possession I admit I don't have very much of
I was born and raised a poor boy and all we had was love
So if you want what's made of clay take his hand and walk away
But he will never love you never more than I
[ ac.guitar ]
Wealth and possession I admit...
But he will never love you never more than I"
"I ain't ever been accused of recusing myself from a Friday night
Don't need no excuse to go out and cut loose beneath the neon light
Ain't got to twist my arm to get me off the farm
Just give me the word, I bet I beat you to the bar
Chorus:
I'm up for just about anything as long as it's almost legal
I can fit in with any old crowd, long as there's a party, they're my kind of people
If you're down with painting the town, I'll be around all night
You know I'm always good for a good time
I'm a pretty good guy in my nine to five, always walking the line
I'll lend a helping hand to a stranger or a friend if they need mine
You can count on me buddy, I'm free
If you've got a bead on a party in need
Repeat Chorus"
"Once I lived a life of wine and roses and I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends would help me make me turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses a victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I'd planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
While I watched the bottle slowly take command
But now I'm paying for..."
"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till we know
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
It's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
"I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I gave all my love to you and I took all your hurt
I treated you so good but you treated me like dirt
They say love is give and take now my poor heart is breaking
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I always gave you everything that I knew how to give
You always took advantage of me you knew I would forgive
I treated you too good for my own good now I'm alone and left forsaken
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
The giving and the taking have caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give and I've taken all that I can take
[ guitar ]
The givng and the taking..."
"I'm goin' down down down goin' down down down got nobody to love me now
I'm a sorrow bound bound bound cause you're not around
Since you left I'm a goin' down down down
Well I never thought my life would be so lonely
Hmm I never thought my head would hang so low
Well I love you my darling and you only
Don't know where you are but that's where I'd like to go
I'm goin' down down down...
[ steel - guitar ]
Well quarrels so many was your reason could it be you never gave us time
For in your heart you desire a new one if so then your heart is not with mine
I'm goin' down down down...
Since you left I'm a goin' down down down"
"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair.""
All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare.
In our town, no scarlet ribbons,
Not one ribbon for her hair.
Through the night my heart was aching.
And just before the dawn was breaking,
I peeked in and on her bed,
In gay profusion lying there,
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.
Scarlet ribbons for her hair.
If I live to be a hundred,
I will never, never know from where,
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair."

"Send me the pillow that you dream on
Don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely
I share your love in dream that once was true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow that you dream on
Maybe time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
I've waited so long for you to write me
But just a memory's all that's left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on
So darling I can dream on it too
So darling I can dream on it too"
"Have you seen the silver raven she has wings and she can fly
Far above the the darkened waters far above the troubled sky
Have you seen the changing rivers now they wait their turn to die
But they turn their tide upon you when the sea begins to cry
Have you seen the changing windows
Of the sea beyond the stars
And the sky beyond the sunbeams and the world beyond your dreams
Have you seen the old world dying
Which was once what new worlds seem
Have you seen the silver raven she has wings that barely gleam
They barely gleam they barely glimmer
As she circles past the sun
And she tries to tell her sister that her trials have just begun
Have you seen the silver raven she has wings and she can fly
Far above the the darkened waters far above the troubled sky
Have you seen the changing rivers now they wait their turn to die
But they turn their tide upon you when the sea begins to cry"
"Run away to the seashore it doesn't matter
anymore
Doesn't matter anymore
Words dry up and fly away with the passing of
the days
Eventually you just let the stone fall
I dreamed that I saw you you were down at the corner store
You were looking through magazines and you
flew out the door
I was trying to wave to you but you wouldn't
wave back
Now you know I understand you're with me only
in the past
Only in the past
My palms are not open they're closed they're
closed
My palms are not open they're closed they're
closed
I dreamed that I saw you you were down at the corner store
You were looking through magazines and you
flew out the door
I was trying to wave to you but you wouldn't
wave back
Now you know I understand you're with me only
in the past
Only in the past
Colours streak the sky we laugh and we cry
And we dance in the cool grass with the
fireflies
And we dance in the cool grass sunset birds
Sweet sweet music swallow our words
You set sail and you left this town
Run away, run away, you're so far from me now
So far from me now
I dreamed that I saw you you were down at the corner store
You were looking through magazines and you
flew out the door
I was trying to wave to you but you wouldn't
wave back
Now you know I understand you're with me only
in the past
Only in the past"
"(I'm goin' home I've been gone so doggone long now at last the rambling fever's gone
I'm goin' home I know that mama'll cry with joy
To see her wanderin' boy I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home I've lived in certain happiness I hadn't met with very much success
I'm goin' home I got holes in both my shoes and a bad case of blues I'm goin' home
I'm goin' home comin' walkin' ridin' when I can
I said I'd be a wealthy man the things don't work out always like you plan
I'm goin' home then maybe back there with my friends
I'll lose this bitterness that burns within
I'm goin' home I got holes in both my shoes and a bad case of blues I'm goin' home)"
"She has the new dress I bought her
And a house for our love used to be
She has the kids after all that she did
But she has no memory of me
She still has my friends around her
And they are looking at her differently
She has a life of her own where I don't belong
But she has no memory of me
She has no memory of me
Forgetting comes easy it seems
After all that she's done she still haven't found
But she has no memory of me
She looks in the mirror in her room
There's a smile where the tears used to be
Her life hasn't changed, it's just rearranged
But she has no memory of me
She has no memory of me
Forgetting comes easy it seems
After all that she's done she's still haven't found
But she has no memory of me
After all she's done she's still haven't found
But she has no memory of me

"I was shaking with laughter
Scared the bratty children
Did I destroy the ambiance
I'm sure for that hoity-toity patron
It wasn't pretty when I looked into the face
Oops, into the eyes, ruptured icy chaos
What's the, what's the, who's the prick
We was hidden in the potted plants
I know and we was no obnoxious
But I could see, there in the sun room
The growing storm of disapproval
It wasn't pretty when I looked into the face
Oops, into the eyes, ruptured icy chaos
What's the, what's the, who's the prick"
"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
His song's too blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry
Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry"
"Daylight has found me here again
You can ask me anything, but where I've been
Things that used to matter seem so small
When you're looking for a soft place to fall
Don't misunderstand me, baby, please
I didn't mean to bring back memories
You should know the reason why I called
I was looking for a soft place to fall
Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you
No, no, no
Looking out your window at the dawn
Baby, when you wake up, I'll be gone
You're the one who taught me after all
How to find a soft place to fall"
"If I'd leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
And if I'd stayed here with you, girl
Well, things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Bye, bye, baby, its been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause the good Lord knows that I'm to blame
And if I'd stayed here with you, girl
Things just could not be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
No, no, I can't change, ain't no way that I can't change
Why don't you fly on freebird?
Fly on freebird
Why don't you fly on freebird?"
"I'm dreaming tonight of a place that I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
This I promise you
I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams"
"Long way going to
Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
I found it in the street
At first I did not see
Lying at my feet
A trampled rose
Passing the hat in church
It never stops going around
You never pay just once
To get the job done
What I done to me,
I done to you
What happened to the trampled rose?
In the muddy street
With the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'
I know that rose,
Like I know my name
The one I gave my love,
It was the same
Now I find it in the street,
A trampled rose"
"(Dolly Parton)
Her two little feet would come running into
Our bedroom almost every night
Her soft little face would be wet from her tears
And her little heart pounding with fright
She'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
In her small voice, we'd hear her remark
""Mommie and Daddy, can I sleep here with you
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
One day in the summer, we took some flowers
To place on some old family graves
Jeannie said, ""Mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
Oh, Daddy, I'd be so afraid""
Then she looked up at her daddy and me
And said somethin' that broke both our hearts
She said, ""When I die, please don't bury me
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
Jeannie was always afraid of the dark
And we never could understand why
'Cause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of care
Because Jeannie was our only child
Perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'Cause it took her one dark stormy night
I think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grown
'Cause it seemed she was destined to die
But on Jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
That glows and never loses its spark
And on the darkest night, there's always a light
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark
Our Jeannie's afraid of the dark"
"Maybe I don't love you quite as much
As I believe I love you, baby
But don't tell me 'cause lovin' you's
A happy state of mind.
Maybe I don't need you quite as much
As I profess to need you, baby
But don't leave me needin' you's
A happy state of mind.
And who's to say anyway
That love is not a game we play
Why's it always gotta be considered
A condition of the heart. hmm hmm
As long as I feel warm inside
Wanted, filled and satisfied
Who am I to be denied this feelin'
Be it love or be it just a happy state of mind.
Maybe it's just something I've imagined
In the hours when I'm sleepin'
But don't wake me cause dreamin' is
A happy state of mind.
Maybe I just gotta have somebody
And you're close and you're somebody
But don't leave me, you've put me in
A happy state of mind.
And who's to say anyway
That love is not a game we play
Why's it always gotta be considered
A condition of the heart. hmm hmm
As long as I feel warm inside
Wanted, filled and satisfied
Who am I to be denied this feelin'
Be it love or be it just a happy state of mind.
You've put me in a happy state of mind
Lovin' you's a happy state of mind
Havin' you's a happy state of mind
Don't take away my happy state of mind"

The one I give my life to
Who are you,
That loves as deep as I do

Who takes me through the flood and through the fire

"Well I made my way from Nasheville, the loving of the Georgia pines
Worked my way to Alabam, didn't even make a dime
Well I wish I was right there with you, my brand new shirt and shoes
Talking about our next move, thinking about these blues
Well if I had a thousand dollars, I'd fly home to you take you
To the Suwannee river, take you on a trip for two
But I'm a sad, lonesome rambler
My money's almost spent
Thinking about my baby's... forgot to pay the rent
Can't you see that little bird flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his true love, just like I mourn for mine
Too many motel rooms, from bar to bar I go
Ain't paying a cent here, having a drink before the show
i'm feeling weary, weary to the bone
Everyone looks so cheery, but me I'm all alone
But I'm a sad, lonesome rambler
My money's almost spent
Thinking about my baby's... forgot to pay the rent"
"If you'd had made a tag on the back
Of those designer jeans she's wearin'
It's some big name brand you can't buy at a Wal-mart
And you from what she's got on
From her Versace to her Louis Vuitton
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by
heart
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
Well she comes pullin' up to you at a red light
In some high-fallutin fancy foreign car
Rich lady shades and a little dog in the window
You'd never know she was born and raised right down on her
grandaddy's farm
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
Oh there ain't no doubt, she's an All American country girl
There's somethin' bout her slow southern twang
It sweet talks me into anything
Her smile, her wink, and her pretty please
Brings any country boy down to his knees
But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie

"This mornin' I jumped on my horse and went out for a ride
Some wild outlaws chased me and they shot me in the side
So I crawled into a wild cat's cave to find a place to hide
But some pirates found me a sleepin' there and soon they had me tied
Till a lady zombie cut me loose and begged to be my bride
So I said I'd come back Wednesday but I must admit I lied
Cause I run away into the swamp but I forgot my guide
And I stepped into some quicksand and no matter how I tried
I couldn't get out until I met a crocodile named Clyde
Who took me to some cannibals who planned to have me fried
They built a fire under me and I swear I almost cried
Till an eagle come and swooped me up and through the air we flied
But he dropped me in a boilin' lake a thousand miles wide
And you know what happened then I died"
"I let my mind wander
And what did it do
I just kept right on goin'
Until it got right to you
Can't trust it one minute
It's worst than a child
This old face without conscience
And it's driving me wild
When I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today but
In terrible memories
Seem to lure it away
My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way
Cause I let my mind wander"
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early
Boys, we oughta shut her down
Just take it to the house
Before anybody starts getting crazy
So I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of Patron, hang on
I just might have to stay
Aw naw, look at the time y'all
What happened to coats on, long gone...
I should be halfway home but aw naw
Yeah, girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cuttin' up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah, I got my boys with me
But we're just blowin' off steam
Not lookin' to pick up anybody
So I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes
Aw naw, did you hear that song,
Oh the one that just came on
Come on, DJ, what you trying to do?
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one
Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw, aw naw
No, I didn't mean to be here this long
I tried to leave so it ain't my fault.
No I didn't mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I supposed to do?
Aw naw, somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron, hang on
We've been here all night long
Aw naw, it would be so wrong
If we didn't dance one more song
Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw
Yeah, aw naw
Those jeans you painted on, aw naw"
"i been playin root-five for most of the night
and most of the times, well, i don't really mind
but once in awhile i get the chance to shine
and look out, baby, when the stage is mine
the good lord knows i do the best i can
on the big, bitch, butch, bull fiddle baby here i am
i got the black horsehair on my big bass bow
a little meaner than the sorrel that was on it before
sawin back and forth to meet the big bass drum
and pretty soon you can hear the rhythm section hum
i gotta buy an extra seat when i ride the airplane
or the womens and the childrens and the pilot complain
cuz it sure dont fit in the overhead bin
and leavin her behind is bassically a sin
yes, leavin her behind might save a little space
and i ain't no slouch on the electrical bass
but somethin kinda happens when the f-holes sing
with the snappin and the poppin of the flat wound strings"
"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare
I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?
I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?"
"I come home every night and she meets me with a great big kiss
And she says I love you and how was your day
She brings me my slippers cooks my dinner and holds my hand
And vows her love for me won't ever fade away
Tell it like it was tell it like it was
Not like it is cause it ain't no more tell it like it was
I told her once I was born with a restless streak in me
But she laughed it off and said honey you're just a man
Go where you have to go do what you have to do
I love you and I'll wait for you and I'll understand
Tell it like it was...
[ steel ]
I called her up last night from down in Mexico
She said baby it's cold tonight and I'm alone
I'm not gonna hold anybody I'm not gonna kiss anybody
I'm saving me for you till you get home
Tell it like it was tell it like it was...
Yeah tell it like it was tell it like it was..."
"All gathered 'round in our Sunday best
After the service on them old church steps
Congregation spilling into the streets
Ain't it funny how the preacher's words
Disappear out here on the curb
Once the weight of an old friend's body and your hands meet
Tending bar up in Syracuse
Momma called when she got the news
Hell, I don't know who she'll miss more, you or me
No, it didn't feel real, no not 'til now
Behind this long black Lincoln in our little town
Rolling by buildings I never thought again I'd see
Chorus:
And I can't help but think about all that we could have been
Had you not stayed here and settled for a life with him
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Buried is the secret that was us
I can still see you standing there
Swollen eyes and snow in your hair
And your shaking voice say you couldn't get past the shame
Eight weeks into a nine month ride
Either way it's still a lie
Carrying your child with another man's name
Repeat Chorus
I walk up and shake his hand, tell him just how sorry I am
And what I wouldn't give to have you back
I wonder if you're looking down on all who is gathered 'round
Knowing one day I too will find peace
Repeat Chorus
Buried is the secret that was us"
"I was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town
Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down
I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309
I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309
Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road
Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight
Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white
Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago
At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel
Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309
But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309"
"Sheriff pulled me over and he started his jive
In a 20 mile zone I was doin 25
Son keep your lead foot off the accelerator
If you don't slow down you'll have to Pay the Alligator
I was countin my money in the back of my store
IRS came a knockin at my door
He found me hidin down behind my own refrigerator
If you don't pay me you gotta Pay the Alligator(whining - Not again!)
Pay the Alligator (Pay the Alligator)
Pay the Alligator (Pay the Alligator)
Might be sooner Might be later
One thing for sure you gotta Pay the Alligator
The afterlife come and it scared me half to death
I heard Saint Peter mutter underneath his breath
Take this bucket well talk about it later
You can paint the pearly gate or Pay the Alligator
Devil caught me lookin at the thermostat
I told him Id never touch nothin like that
He said shut the hell up and do what I say
Or you gonna have the alligator to pay
Order in the Court! Suspect on the Stand!
He said he saw the witness with a whistle in his hand
The Judge said I hate to implicate the perpetrator
But if you jack with the Judge, you gotta pay the Alligator
Walk on razors and sleep on on nails
Talk like ducks and walk like quails
Go blindfolded backwards through the Disconbobulater
If you don't do it right you gotta Pay the Alligator"
"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.
Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go.
Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.
Massa and missis have long gone before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more."
"Most everybody's got
A secret dresser drawer
Or an old shoebox
A back bedroom closet door
And maybe when it rains
Or when nobody else is home
We open it
And find we're really not alone
If you could see me now
Kneeling on this floor
Watching the memories dance
Holding the flower you wore
You said I would forget
You said that was your greatest fear
But you're still here
Baby, you're still here.
And in my heart,
You are not forgotten.
A love this strong
Will hold you close to me
I know you're gone
But Heaven doesn't really seem that far
Even worlds apart
Please know you're not
Forgotten.
Oh
Some people take the past
And make it disappear
They pack their heartaches up
Through out the laughter with the tears
But I don't wanna lose
How good we used to be
So you're still here
You're still here with me
And in my heart,
You are not forgotten.
A love this strong
Will hold you close to me
I know you're gone
But Heaven doesn't really seem that far
Even worlds apart
Please know you're not
Forgotten.
But now you're gone
But Heaven doesn't really seem that far
Even worlds apart
Please know you're not
Forgotten
Ooh"
"McKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doc said, ""McKinley I can't find the cause
You're bound to die, you're bound to die""
Doc told the horse, he'd throw down his rein
He said to the horse, ""You gotta outrun the train
From Buffalo to Washington""
The Doc came a-running, he took off his specs
He said, ""Mr McKinley better cash in your checks
You've bound to die, you're bound to die""
Look here, you rascal, you see what you've done
You shot my husband and I've got your gun
I'm carrying you back, to Washington"
"Even your losses can count for anything
Paid in your crosses to look like other things
All of your best thoughts can't seem to find a home
It's harder to fight them when you can't get one alone
It's something on your mind won't let them be
You feel it inside, you're not that free
Even salvation can cost your everything
When all your temptations just leave you settling
It's something on your mind won't let them be
You feel it inside, you're not that free
[Guitar]
It's something on your mind won't let them be
You feel it inside, you're not... that free
Aaahhh"

"How I ever made it to you heaven only knows
With the doors and the windows to my inside closed
I don't now how you got in
But I'll never let you out again
[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel every single drop of rain
My heart's revealed every time I hear your name
I feel your touch in the sunlight on my skin
The subtle brush of your kisses in the wind
You take my dreams and you make them even more
You make me feel like I never loved before
You lift me high light me on fire
You set me free you let me see
You make me feel
Now it seems like everything you do surprises me
I never thought I'd ever really love reality
But you gave me a taste for love
That I couldn't imagine of
[Chorus]"
"If I had a great big mansion
I'd rather live in a shotgun shack with you
And if I drove a red Ferrari
I'd rather ride in an Oldsmobile with you
If I won a million dollars
I'd give it away to spend more time with you
And if I had a million lovers
I would trade 'em all
For just one night with you
With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like putting on my favorite pair of shoes
Oh, I like to be with me when I'm with you
If I owned the finest vineyard
I'd rather sit and drink cheap wine with you
If I could live on the moon
I would rather stay in Tennessee with you
If I could sail across the ocean
The ocean would just be blue without you
And if I climbed up Mount Everest
I would turn around and climb in bed with you
With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like putting on my favorite pair of shoes
Oh, I like to be with me when I'm with you
If I could be like Albert Einstein
I'd rather just be dumb and be with you
If I could sing like Frank Sinatra
I would rather just sit and talk with you
With you I can be myself
With you I don't have to be somebody else
It's like putting on my favorite pair of shoes
Oh, I like to be with me when I'm with you"
"I've been a moonshiner for seventeen long years
I spent all my money on whiskey and beers
I go to some hollow and put up my stilt
I'll make you one gallon for two dollar bill
I go to some grocery and drink with my friends
No women to follow to see what I spent
God bless those women I wish they were mine
Their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine
I'll eat when I'm hungry and drink when I'm dry
If moonshine don't kill me I'll live till I die
God bless those moonshiners, I wish they were mine
Their breath smells as sweet as the good ol' moonshine
I might go to heaven, I might go to hell
Till I meet my maker don't know where I'll [Incomprehensible]
It feels like stirred whiskey, I'll live in the sky
High upon the mountain with some sweet moonshine"
"I watch the sky that brightens with the dawn
And I know this night with you is almost gone
And I memorize each moment of the special thing that's been
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
A daylight call the rest I struggle through it's changed into a magic time with you
Why once again my hands and eyes take your beauty in
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
It's true we talk of future things to be but beyond this dawn's too far for me to see
So hold me now and love me before the night time ends
Just in case a night like this one never comes again
Just in case a night like this one never comes again"
"Oh sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that or do I ever cross your mind
[ fiddle - mandolin ]
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Cause you miss me do you darling
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind
[ guitar ]
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all or do I ever cross your mind
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mind"
"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners were slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true it's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away where his glory forever I'll share
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross"
"O, there will be peace in the valley for me, one day
There will be peace in the valley for me, I pray
No sadness, no sorrow, no more trouble there will be
There will be peace in the valley for me
You know the bear will be gentle
you know wolves gonna be so tamed
Mighty lion, if you will right now,
will lie down with the lamb, oh yes
I know the horse from the wild
Will be led by a little child
and I'll be changed from this creature"
"The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long
That I lost count of days
When you come home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along
I'm gonna tell you, gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
Not so much as a kiss goodbye
I don't want to think of the reasons why
I don't wanna think of reasons why
Most things I wanna say
They will go unspoken always
But if you look a little closer in my eye
You will know everything there is to know
You're gonna know you're gonna know
Everything I thought
Overcome the sloth, got me a ride to New York
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye
The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long that I lost count of days
But when you come home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along
I'm gonna tell you, gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss goodbye"
"I'm gonna raise the Titanic
Sail across the Atlantic
And this time it ain't gonna sink
I'm gonna sit here in this chair
With this beer and declare
It's the last one I'll ever drink
Buy a pair of dinosaur skin boots
Take a walk across the moon
Yeah that's what I'm gonna do
I can do that with no sweat
You can bet it's a sure bet
I'm telling the Gods honest truth
But I can't undo what I did
Or un-say what I said
Or un-break what I broke in you
'Cause there's just a few things impossible to do
I'm gonna do some soul searching
Put my mind to working
On fixing the hurting I've done
Drop down into first gear
Jump clean into next year
By then you'll be back or still gone
Ride in on a rainbow
Land out side your window
That's what I'm gonna do"
"Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
And make the world, make it go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took you away
Well if you do, then forgive me
And make the world, make it go away
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
And make the world, make it go away
Now I'm sorry if I hurt you
Let me make it up to you day by day
And if you will please forgive me
And make the world, make it go away
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
And make the world, make it go away"
"There's a cabin in the pines in the hills of Caroline
And a blue-eyed girl is waiting there for me
I'll be going back someday and for her I'll never stray
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
Oh the cabin in the shadows of the pines
And a blue-eyed girl way down in Caroline
Someday she'll be my wife and we'll live a happy life
In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
I'm packin' my grip for that long long trip
Back to the hills of Caroline
I want to see that blue-eyed girl she's the sweetest in the world
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline.
And when it's late at night and the moon is shinin' bright
And the whipoorwill is calling from the hill
Then I'll tell her of my love beneath the stars above
How I love her now and I know I always will."
"She's still the angel that I knew before the only difference now is she's mine
In an apron or a nightgown or the wedding dress she wore
She's a perfect angel all the time
You know it's funny how when you first meet a girl
And start likin' her you always see her at her best
All made up her hair just right dressed nicely
And you just assume she's like that 24 hours a day
Then when you get married it's face-cream and body-pins and hair-rollers at night
Makeup eyelashes hairspray in the mornin'
Soapsuds floorwax and bacon grease through the day
And then you stop and think about it
And she's really goin' through all the stuff just for you
And knowin' that makes her all the more beautiful
She's still the angel..."
"If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong
You are all I'll every have
And I'll love you good or bad
Where you go I'll go with you
No matter where you take me to
I'll go through hell And back again
I'll be with you Until the end
If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you...."

Hangin' from the mirror of my ride,
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scannin' through the stations
Lookin' for that country sound
The good stuffs iced up in the back seat,
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
I got my shades on, top back,
Rollin' with the music jacked,
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset, I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up, laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothin' but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with just chillin' it
Nothin' but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine
I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses, you got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right

Sure enough tangled up, laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit

"Pickin' up the pieces of my heart
Love to you is nothing but a fashion that stays in style util you change your mind
And when you think it's time to try a new love
You go and leave my broken heart behind
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces
I'm just pickin' up the pieces of my broken heart
You've got me pickin' up the pieces I've been pickin' up the pieces

"Let the beer bottle
Rattle on my pistol
On the seat of my Chevy pick up truck
And I'm taking these gravel roads
As fast as my truck will go
I'm running like a scared white tail buck
It was a long night card game
With Earl Ray and Bobby
And some ol boy they worked with from Adair
That boy didnt like me
Then he said I was cheatin
Gun shots rang out on the midnight air
I dont wanna see the day light
But my Becky's alone tonight
I wonder if shes waiting up for me
I'm gonna hide out in the bottom
Where I hunted deer and turkey
I know that swamp like the back of my hand
Hell I was born and raised here
Just wanted to be a good ol boy
Never thought I'd ever be a wanted man
But soon they gonna catch me
Aint no way around that
Cause I dont know any other place to hide
I wonder if Becky's Bible is still in the glove box
Cause I'm sure gonna need it if that boy died
I dont wanna see the daylight
But my Beckys alone tonight
I wonder if she's waiting up for me
Sometime tomorrow morning
When I ought to be fishing
They'll probably be hauling me in
I'll be sittin in the jail house
No need to be wishing
I'll ever get to fish the green river again
I""ll be prayin for some daylight
Cause my Becky's alone tonite
I wonder if she's waiting up for me.
I Wonder if shes waiting up for me."
"Lately Grace hasn't been herself
And he's noticed the change
Like forgetting friends they have known for years and misplacing her things
He'd make a joke; they both laugh
And blame it on old age
It's not funny anymore, She can't remember his name
He believes way down deep she still
Knows is Fourty years of memories
Just can't disappear like this
The doctors say it's hopeless, her
Past has been erased
But he'll spend the rest of his
Life, Saving Grace
Raised five kids on a farmers pay, Vietnam took a son, but watching Grace live like this is the hardest thing he has done
He sits there by her bed sometimes, while she's fast asleep. Tell's her all about herself strokes her hair and weeps
He believes way down deep she still
Knows is. Fourty years of memories
Just can't disappear like this. The
Doctors say it's hopeless, her past
Has been erased. But he'll spend
The rest of his life, Saving Grace
The woman that he's loved for years
Is somewhere trapped in the pain
Tonight he swears she smiled at him and almost spoke his name
The doctors say it's hopeless, her past has been erased. But he'll spend the rest of his life, Saving Grace
He believes way down deep she still
Knows is
But Lately Grace hasn't been herself"
"It's feelin' longer now than it ever has before
Another memory is another slammin' door
It's gettin' too dark now to see
Every photograph is another lesson learned
Every sleepless night is another page I've turned
I wake up to fallin' dreams
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
If I had a chance, I must've missed it long ago
If I could run away, I wouldn't have to let you go
This angel's bound to stray
Like an hourglass, I'm a soul to sinkin' sand
You try to hold my heart and I will slip right through your hands
Time just blows away
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
And the tears forever flow
And the petals start to fade by the picket fences
Just another shade of miles and miles to go
And this angel's bound to stray
It's another shade of miles and miles to go"
"It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still on the river are the old folks still the same
And by the way did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came do you remember if she cried a tear or two
Is the homesteam still on fire do they still win all their games
And by the way did she mention my name
[ steel - guitar ]
Is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high did the look in her eyes seem far away
Won't you say hello for someone there'll be no need to explain
And by the way did she mention my name oh by the way did she mention my name"
"I'm glad you called me, I still feel your voice
Touch something inside me but I have no choice
But to tell you I'm no longer one of boys
And I can't get to you from here
Now I don't think you'd know me if you saw me up close
I've built me a family and I don't like to boast
But I'm all settled in to what I need the most
And I can't get to you from here
I can't turn back the years
And get crazy again and have nothing to fear
Easy as it might appear
I just can't turn my back and get there from here
I only bet when I've got all the cards
I don't take on all comers when they come on too hard
I'm a daddy and a voter and I go to bed tired
And I can't get to you from here
I can't turn back the years
And get crazy again and have nothing to fear
Easy as it might appear
I just can't turn my back and get there from here
Well I only bet when I've got all the cards
I don't take on all comers when they come on too hard
I'm a daddy and a voter and I go to bed tired
And I can't get to you from here"
"Hallways and staircases everyday to climb
To go up to my white walled room out on the end of time
Where I can be with my love for she is all that is mine
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time
I laugh with her, cry with her, hold her close she is mine
The way she tells me of her love and never is she trying
She don't have to be assured of many good things to find
And she'll always be there, my love don't care about time
Her eyes are dark and deep with love, her hair hangs long and fine
She walks with ease and all she sees is never wrong or right
And with her arms around me tight I see her all in my mind
And she'll always be there my love don't care about time"
"Love on the rocks that's all he said
As he sat there beside me shaking his head
I said Mister you look like you're taking it rough
The next round's on me he said I don't touch the stuff
Cause these hundred proof mem'ries are stronger than wine
It don't take but one taste to send you out of your mind
No I don't want the whiskey but I could sure use a ride
Cause with hundred proof mem'ries Lord you don't think and drive
[ guitar - steel ]
He said I quit drinkin' the day that she left
I come here out of habit in spite of myself
But there ain't no liquor that money can buy
That's stronger than what's bottled up inside
Cause these hundred proof mem'ries...
No I don't want the whiskey..."
"On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind
Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind
Too long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone
But today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old San Antone
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone
He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight
He'd sent for Carmela to meet him at the banks of the Brazos tonight
She was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago
As he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty Brazos below
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'll walk straight in old San Antone
Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found
As the rangers' badges shone brightly and bandito lay on the ground
Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain
As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again
Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn
Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone
I'm safe when I reach San Antone"
"I make 6, the rent takes 5,
It ain't high livin' but I'm alive
Mac & chesse, Natrual Light,
I don't have it all but I've got time.
To live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do is worry.
I got this girl, I met last week
I've seen her twice and she's calling me
She loves to laugh and drink a little wine
I'm not married yet but I've got time.
I've got time to live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do right now is worry,
I can do whatever rolls across my mind cause I've got time.
Mm yeah,
Life is good, life is tough, it knocks you down, brings you luck
More days and nights mm, I'm just fine
Anythings possible cause I've got time
To live and learn man I ain't in no hurry
The only thing I don't have time to do right now is worry,
I can do whatever rolls across my mind
Yeah, cause I've got
Dreams to spare cause some may fail
But there's one out there bound to serve me well
The good Lord gave me the sense to realize
I've got everything, cause I've got time
Yeah I've got time
Yes I do oh yeah
Mm there ain't no hurry
Oh we ain't got time to worry
Yeah I've got time
Whatever rolls across my mind
I've got time oh yeah"
"Same old man sitting at the mill
The mill turns around of its own free will
Hand in the hopper and the other in the sack
Ladies step forward and the gents fall back
Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome day and a lonesome night
Thought I heard a pretty girl say
Court all night and you sleep next day
Well then, said the raven as she flew
If I was a young one I'd get two
One for to fetch and the other to sew
I'd have a string for my bow, bow, bow
My old man's in Kalamazoo
He don't give no ""yes, I do""
First to the left and then to the right
This old mill grinds day and night"
"Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my dreams with me
I need you so
In life we search
And some of us find
I`ve looked for you
A long, long time
And now that I`ve found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me
Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my dreams with me
I`ve searched for you so
And now that I`ve found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me"
"The nights were dark and long
I spent a million all alone
But I never once stopped loving you
My world was cold and still
My dreams lay unfulfilled
But I never once stopped loving you
[Chorus:]
I never once stopped believing we'd love again
The way we used to do
And today when you came back my patience was rewarded
For I never once stopped loving you
I could have loved another
But I chose the way and suffered
For I never once stopped loving you
And I prayed to God to guide you
Till I could be beside you
And I never once stopped loving you
[Chorus:]"
"Goodnight Irene goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a big notion
To jump in the river and drown.
And say Irene goodnight, Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
I love Irene God knows
I do love her till sea runs dry
And if Irene turns her back on me
I'll lay right down and I'll die.
And say Irene goodnight, Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.

Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife just parted
So I'll take another stroll downtown.
Yeah, Irene goodnight, Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.
Hey, rambler stop your ramblin'
Stop stayin' out late at night
Go home to your wife and the family
Stay by the fireside bright.
Yeah, Irene goodnight, Irene
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams.

"Why do you keep looking out the window?
Is there something left behind or never found?
Mmm do I even want to know?
How, if you knew what I was thinking
I wonder if it'd even draw a tear
Oh, there's just one way to find out
Go, Go, Go
Did Sirens steal your heart when you weren't looking?
Where'd you learn to lie the way you do?
Look's like you made up your mind.
I'd have to say I didn't see this coming
But who does?
You won't see me standing in the door
So Go, Go, Go
I don't want to hurt you
(Do you ever listen?)
I don't want to run.
(You're not the only one)
I don't want to touch you
(I'm tired of being broken)
Oh, Look what we've become
(Look what we've become)
I don't even care
(I really need you)
I don't want to
Go, Go, Go
I don't want to go
(I don't want to stay)
I don't want to stay
(I don't want to go)"
"There is nothing that is wrong
Wanting you to stay here with me
I know you got somewhere to go
Won't you make yourself at home and never leave
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
Sun ain't nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies
Love is all that matters won't you stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you
I long to see the mornin' light
Color in your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
And don't you ever leave
Lay Down Sally resting in my arms
Don't you think you want someone to talk to
Lay Down Sally no need to leave so soon
I been tryin' all night long just to talk to you"
"I spent my lifetime wishin' the waitress would come around
Tellin' jokes and shootin' pool on the other side of town
When the whistle blows at five o'clock there's only one place I'll be found
Down at Ernie's icehouse liftin' longnecks to that good old country sound
And talkin' 'bout the good old times
Braggin' on how it used to be
But I've worn out the same old lines
And now it seems nothing's news to me
There's nothin' like a steel guitar cryin' in the night
There's nothin' like a sawdust floor and a good old friendly fight
I'd finally find my way back home and you'd patch up my face
But that was another time and another place
Repeat chorus
And now we're talkin' 'bout the good old times
I wonder how I came to be the know-it-all I am
And how the world ever got used to me"
"Oh, I wish I had someone to love me
Yes, someone to call me their own
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with
Cause I'm tired of living alone.
Oh, please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Oh, please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told.
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leaving my poor darling alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone.
Now, I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darling would suffer
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold.
Now if I had the wings like an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my darling
And there I'd be willing to die"
"Writers: Doug Supernaw, Allen Huff
Well I wish you could have seen us
One car between us
Too far gone so someone had to go
She called her mama
And I called her a friend
But we couldn't get a hold of either one of them
As luck would have it
She had a habit
Of winning every fight that we get in
So she fired the ignition
but she kept bitchin
until the minute that we pulled in
She was good enough to drive me to drinkin
And drop me off at the bar
She pulled away in our eighty-three Lincoln
And I ain't seen her no more
But at least she knew where my heart was at
For years I never found hers
I drove her to the brink an'
She drove me to drinkin'"
"I'm gonna tear your merry go round down stop your running around town
You're gonna lose your sneaking shoes I'm gonna tear you merry go round down
Well I ain't gonna be your hobby horse to ride
Walk up and down the midway by your side
We're on the road we cross it and love don't have a chance
You're too busy pitching pennies to think about romance
I'm gonna tear...
[ dobro ]
Well too many sideshows upset our plans
Why I'd have to reap your lawn and even hold your hand
In your little world of make believe love can't be real
And we can't keep on ridin' on this great big ferries wheel
So I'm gonna tear...
I'm gonna tear..."
"I really go for you knowin' in my heart you won't be there
I'd cross the seven seas your smallest whim to please
Around the world and then all the way back again
To love the way I do seems so unfair
I really go for you knowin' in my heart you won't be there
I really go for you oh can't you see
How much I want you to go for me
A little love that's true each none and all
I really go for you dream a mighty big to be so small
I really go for you it's more real
I really want you to feell what I feel
The message can't get through my heart could say
I really go for you I wish you go with me all the way"
"Oh the stars are out, and the moon is high
Over your shoulder
Shinin' like a neon halo in your hair
Dancin' in slow motion
To music only you and I can hear
And I've fallen again, like I always do
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
I lose my breath and I can't speak
I never tasted love this sweet
And every time it feels brand new
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
Now I'm wide awake, and I'm dreamin' still
Lost in the moment, all I can do is simply ride the tide
Oh, sweet surrender,
I couldn't stop this goin' under if I tried
And I've fallen again, like I always do
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold you
I lose my breath and I can't speak
I never tasted love this sweet
And every time it feels brand new
That's what happens when I hold you
That's what happens when I hold
That's what happens when I hold you"
"I don't pick up the mail,
I don't pick up the phone,
I don't answer the door,
I just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up,
I just keep the lights down,
I don't live in these rooms,
I just rattled around
I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm shadow upon these walls,
As quietly as a mouse,
I haunt these halls,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house
I don't care if it rains,
I don't care if it's clear,
I don't mind stayin' near,
There's another ghost here,
He sits down in your chair,
And he shines with your light,
And he lays down his head,
On your pillow at night
I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,
I'm just a whisper of smoke,
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,
That once burned out of control,
You took my body and soul,
I'm just a ghost in this house"
"What now my love now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see once I could feel
Now I am numb I've become unreal
I walk the night but without a goal
Stripped of my heart my soul
What now my love now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be
What now my love now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on
No one would care no one would cry
If I should live or die"
"If I Ever Love Again
( Written by Curtis Wright / Billy Spencer )
I felt a little uneasy when you walked in
But I'm glad you agreed to see me once again
If for no one's sake but mine
While I've got the chance this time
I want to tell you just what a fool I've been
There have been a lot of changes in my life
And there's a long list of wrongs I'm making right
But of all the things I've done
Hurting you is still the one
Mistake that I keep making in my dreams every night
Chorus:
But if I ever love again
I know one thing for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
When I think about the man I used to be
It's no wonder that you just gave up on me
But standing here today
I just want to say
It's my belief in what we had that finally set me free
Chorus:
And if I ever love again
I know one thing for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
If I ever love again, I'll tell you honestly
I'll do my best to love her just the way that you loved me
Chorus:
And if I ever love again
I promise you for sure
That if I ever love again
It won't be like before
Cause losing you's the price I paid
To learn that love is only made to give
If I ever love again
If I ever love again"
"We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
With you
Right by my side
I got nothing to hide
From an old yellow moon
And now
As I turn back the years
So little I've learned
About heartache and tears
[Chorus]
But still
I'm making my way
Into the heart
Of an unknown highway
We are
Following stars
Way cross the sky
Round an old yellow moon
[Chorus]
We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon"
"She packed her bags and moved to Florida
I've been blue since she's been gone
And this bowling green motel room
Is now my old Kentucky home
All she left me was some whiskey
And these funny cigarettes she rolled
It must have been her main intention
To watch our dreams go up in smoke
It's another blue grass morning
I'm gonna blow my mind away
In this smoke old motel room looks
Like it's gonna be another blue grass day
She's soakin' up the sun in Florida
I'm smokin' up this motel room
She's sippin' drinks down by the ocean
I'm guzzlin' blue Kentucky moon
It's another blue grass morning..."
"It's been five days since I shaved, I swear
My hair's gettin' long but I don't care
Lawn chair sitting, ain't going nowhere
A big old smile on my face
Pointin' out pictures in a cloudy sky
Craving me a piece of that pecan pie
Might lay in the grass and kill some time
Looking like I'm in a daze
But it ain't no purple haze
Chorus:
I ain't stoned on what you think
Just an afternoon sun that's starting to sink
I ain't drunk on nothing you can buy
Just a kiss from a woman and a look in her eye
What I'm on you don't need much
It's a little goes a long way kinda stuff
Yeah, I'm breathing, yeah, I'm feeling alright
I'm high on life
Gettin' buzzed by this bumble bee flying around
My day in the sun is my night on the town
Just me waking up is me getting down
Spinning like a tilt-a-whirl
Sitting on top of the world
Repeat Chorus
I ain't saying that stuff is bad
But it's so low compared to the highs I have
Counting my blessings, kicking back
Sipping on sweet tea in a glass
And watching my baby laugh
Don't get much better than that
Repeat Chorus
I'm finally believing what I'm seeing
That's why
I'm high on life
Oh, high on life"
"Sometimes you sing for the money sometimes you sing for the show
Sometimes you sing for the dewy eyed darlings
Still makes them cry don't you know
Sometimes you sing for the glory but glory don't last very long
And through the haze of the stage can you look back to days
When you used to sing for the song
Sing for the song boy just like you did when you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the glow
Sing for the song boy just like you did before all of the flash bulbs
And cocaine and bright things and ladies got hold of your soul
But you really don't make too much money and you donn't give much of a show
And them dewy eyed darling next week will be crying
For somebody else don't you know
But the music's become your burden and the words all sound twisted and wrong
And the hits that you sell don't taste quite as well
As when you used to sing for the song
Sing for the song boy...
Sing for the song boy...
Sing for the song"
"There's a difference, in the way she feels when I touch her now
I can tell that something's wrong but I can't put my finger on when, the why, or how
And there's a coldness in the way she swears I'm not the reason she's not in the mood
And it tears me up inside to lie here next to her while she lies to me about you
She thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise, 'cause I'm hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink its on me, then get up and walk away
You see I've known her long enough to know how she was before she was mine
And I'm not oblivious its just I've been the only one for all this time
So now you know the reason I came in here tonight to put an end to this romance
There's nothing you can say or do to prove to me that shes not worth a second chance
She still thinks I don't know but I'm about to lose control
She's the kinda love that builds you up enough but she can't stand to be alone
Hell's what I'm gonna raise, 'cause I'm hell bent on a change
Buddy finish your drink hell its on me, then get up and walk away"
"In my adobe hacienda there's a touch of Mexico
Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio
Soft desert stars the strum of guitars make every evening seem so sweet
In my adobe hacienda life and love are more complete
[ ac.guitar - steel ]
In my adobe hacienda nested in the western hills
Evening breezes softly murmur harmony with whippoorwills
Soft desert stars the strum of guitars...
Life and love are more complete"
"We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had might've set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down
Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
I've been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes, it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine"
"Chorus:
A heartsong melody play like a symphony
The sweetest music I have ever known
A song of joy and pain
The mountain angels sing
A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong
Farmer's daughter if you will
And I often wonder still
In memories where I rammbled as a child
Makes me cry and makes me laugh
My reflections on the past
And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life
Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs
Just enough to go around
But the sweetest things in life are always free
Like the songs the birds would sing
And the sweet new grass of spring
And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree
Repeat Chorus
And I recall the thrill and joy
Of a Smokey Mountain boy
I remember my first kiss and my first love
And the songs I'd song and write
And the dreams I'd clutch so tight
And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove
And in that little house 'a prayer
Where I spent many hour
Prassin' God and liftin' up His name
And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me
As I headed up that rocky road to fame
And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world
But it makes no difference just how far I roam
I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart
My faith in God and memories of home
Repeat Chorus"
"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you
I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...
They tell me I must reap just what I have sown but darling I hope it's not true
For once I made plans about living alone but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...
But that was before I met you"
"Deep in the night
I hear the darkness
Bones tell the body
Rest in its arms
I hear the calling
Of life's sweet embrace
Resting too soon
Deep in the night
I feel the stardust
Blue tells the heavens
Fall from the sky
I feel the shadows
Of time's own longing
Falling away
Deep in the night
I pray a candle
To tell the snowfall
Wait for sunrise
I pray a halo
Of man's cold morning
Holds to the light
I pray a halo
Of man's cold morning
Holds through the night"
"Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
You know you got a job and a little bitty check
Six pack of beer and a television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
A little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while"

Miss june's old gray two-story
Stands at the edge of town
Its weathered boards could use a coat of paint
The shudders need a lettin' down
It was a famous boarding house
Back in my daddy's day
That's been more than twenty years ago
Now it's a home for runaways
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
Miss june still wears the wedding ring
Of the man who broke her heart
She closed the house the day he left
And tore her world apart
Broken lives found a commond bond
When she took a young girl in
Now she's using lessons life has taught
Helpin' kids to start again
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
Wounded hearts on broken wings
No longer frightened and alone
In her past, she turned young girls out
Now she's there to guide them home
At the house of fallen angels
You'll find someone to ease your weary mind
There'll be a meal and a bed where you can lay your head
She never turns away a stranger
From the house of fallen angels
From the house of fallen angels
The house of fallen angels"
"Once I had a heart cold as ice love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun
Once I had a trick up my sleeve and a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young girl I found
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love
Now who'd have thought that someone like you could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit"
"(One love one life one dream forever one love for one heart till death do us part)
Forsaking all others till death do us part
Wherever you go I'll follow and whatever you do I want to be part of it
Because you're so much a part of me that I just couldn't live without you
Forsaking all others for better or worse I don't even have to think about it
Because no matter how rough it gets along the way
Every step that I take with you is over a mountain of happiness
Or through a valley of golden sunshine
For richer or poorer I'll never be poor as long as I own your love
Because it's the most priceless possession that I have
You made me the richest girl in the world when you gave your heart to me
Every day with you is a heaven on earth
That neither money can buy not poverty take away
I'm yours to hold to keep and to love forever
With every beat of my heart I live only for you
(One love one life one dream forever one love for one heart till death do us part)
Till death do us part"
"I want to tell you all the story
'Bout the Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
She said, ""Mama, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA""
Well, the note said
""Mrs. Johnson, you're a wearing your dresses way too high""
It's reported you've been
Drinking and a running round with men and goin' wild
We don't believe you ought to be a
Bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when
Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And then she walked up to the blackboard
I still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the
Harper Valley PTA""
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use
A lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us
Why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Payton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No, I wouldn't put you on
Because it really did it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the
Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the
Harper Valley PTA"

Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
I've been savin' my favorite shirt
Savin' it up for a Friday night
This time I'm gonna make it work
Gonna make it work with all my might
So whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Waxin' up my shiny car
Getting' ready for the weekend
Top down we can see the stars
Blowin' that summer wind
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Let's hide away and let the feelin' in
I wanna hear you say you love me
once again
Let's hide away and let the night begin
Oh-watcha gonna do when the sun
goes down
Hop in my back seat way out of town
I know a place we can't be found
Whatcha gonna do when the sun
goes down"
"I left home with a suitcase, my songs and my guitar
Headed down to Nashville gonna try to be a star
The Nashville folks they made me feel like I was right at home
But they couldn't understand my cowboy songs
They said son you've got potential
And we'd like to see you stay
But you've gotta change your style
'Cause cowboy songs don't sell these days
I tried my hand at cheatin' heart and cryin' in my beer
And I think about home and wonder what am I doin' here
But I'd really like to thank y'all for your hospitality
You know I really mean it, you've been mighty good to me
But this ol' country boy
Ain't where he's suppose to be
And this Wyoming cowboy
Don't belong in Nashville Tennessee
Well, there's just too many miles and styles between us I suppose
The kind of songs I'm singin' won't fit in down here I know
I kind of got the feeling it was time to move along
When Ed Bruce sang 'The last cowboy song'
So I'm going back to the country where the west is still alive
Where cowboy's ride the prairie and the mountains touch the sky
I pack up my old guitar and I'll be on my way
But before I go I'd just like to say
Well, I'd really like to thank
Well, this Wyoming cowboy
Don't belong in Nashville Tennessee"
"Remember when we got the news
Confirming our worst fears
I said he wouldn't make it six months
And others gave him a year
And sure enough last Saturday
We paid our last respects
He left us here still in this life
And he's gone on to the next
I'd never seen him wear a tie
But he looked so natural, almost lifelike
The preacher spoke, his mother cried
When he said Son, you may now kiss the bride
Everyone cheered, I thought how odd
I didn't understand
Why with champagne and cake we celebrate
The death of a single man
So many flowers, he was so loved
Prior to the bride
As a matter of fact
The maid of honour should be disqualified
To all his friends, it's a wake-up call
If it happened to him
It can happen to us all
Nothing says it's over man
Like a bad 80's cover band
How can we dance to My Sharona
At the death of a single man
He was so young
So full of dreams
Before the day he fell
Now he's gone on to a better place
Or possibly to hell
Now here we are, seems so unfair
It's poker night and there's one empty chair
So many things we're gonna miss
His happy smile and that great laugh of his
I think of him in the after wife, life
I guess all good things must end
So with Jack and Coke, we'll make a toast
To the death of a single man"
"You're still alive inside somewhere
Or are you just remains?
You're blood muscle skin and bone
So people cause you pain
But when the skies are crashing down
And when my days are dark and grey
When my fires are burning low
When the life inside me fades
I know that I can count on you
Because you never let me lie
You bring the truth back to me now
You bring my back to life
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
There's a place I call my home
Where the sun falls down on me
The light fills in the shadows there
And peace of mind is free
But far below that place
A tear forms in my eye
The shadows have no foe there
And darkness multiplies
I know that I can count on you
Because you've never lead me astray
You bring the truth back to me now
You always light my way
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak"
"MY WHOLE WORLD IS FALLING DOWN
(Bill Anderson - Jerry Crutchfield)
'64 Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH AND BY BRENDA LEE
My whole world is a falling down falling down falling down
My whole world is a falling down I'm losin' my baby
You told me that your love for me was true
Said you would love me your whole life through
But now you're asking me to set you free
You found somebody you love more than me
My whole world is a falling down...
Where did she come from what's her name
What did she do to set your heart a flame
I'm all alone while she's with you
You're having fun my heart's breaking in two
My whole world is a falling down...
I miss your loving that was so fine
I need it I need it oh all the time
I still love you in the same old way
But I'm losin' you a little more every day
My whole world is a falling down...
My whole world is a falling down..."
"Sometimes when life's poison arrows shoot me to the ground
Dreams come fallin' down, friends just can't be found
I don't worry, I don't wonder, I know what to do
I don't go crazy, I just go for you
Surround me with love, I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love, oh and I can make it
Whatever comes, you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with love
Who can say what comes tomorrow, what the future holds?
What lies down the road, heaven only knows
But one thing I know for certain, one thing that's true
One thing I'm sure of is I need you
Surround me with love, I need you beside me
I want you to hold and hide me
When this world is closin' in on me
Surround me with love, oh and I can make it
Whatever comes, you know I can take it
Just as long as you surround me with love"
"I'd been building hopes so long
Honey, I must have lost sight of what went wrong
'Cause in sorrow's blinding light today
Baby, it looks like my dreams were made of clay
Years of yearning spent for you
Honey, I know now were the cravings of a fool
I guess your wants just slipped away
And baby, it looks like my dreams were made of clay
I knew love could toss you down
An' leave you there to crawl around
But never thought that was a fall we'd make
Getting up was nothing new
The kind of thing hearts learn to do
But knowing how doesn't mean it's easy to take
So I'll forget about
Plans we had for me and you
And dwell on thoughts lonely lives pursue
Praying memories don't stay
'Cause baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clay
I knew love could toss you down
An' leave you there to crawl around
But never thought that was a fall we'd make
Getting up was nothing new
The kind of thing hearts learn to do
But knowing how doesn't mean it's easy to take
So I'll forget about
Plans we had for me and you
And dwell on thoughts lonely lives pursue
Praying memories don't stay
Baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clay
Yeah baby, it looks like our dreams were made of clay"
"I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
When you look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes.
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife.
Well the measure of people
Don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty
And still wearin' jeans.
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife."
"The kiss was colder than I remember
When we first said hello
I guess the flame's now a little lower
I can feel you letting go
You know the pain drops a little darker
Then when you first put it on
I guess your love's like some old cheap and magic marker
Said forever nice go
But you don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall
When we first fell, we fell a long way
Summer nights and winter days
Mountain sunrise, ocean sunset
Hand in hand in the haze
Now it's cold heart summer evenings
And there's clouds on my sunrise
But you don't have to smile and say you're happy
I can see what's in your eyes
You don't have to paint me a picture
You don't have to say things at all
You don't have to paint me a picture
I can see in the writing on the wall"
"(Dolly Parton)
Busy signal
That's what I get when I call you
Busy busy
Talking to someone new
I wish I knew
I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother
Or then again it could even be his little brother
On the line
Making me lose my mind
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
Busy signal
How can I tell him I'm sorry
When I said I didn't care
I didn't mean a word I said
Talking outta my head
I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him
All the time
So please somebody quit tying up the line
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you baby
I really really love you baby"
"I didn't wanna be no soldier didn't wanna leave your side
Didn't wanna cross that ocean it's so deep and wide
Now I guess that I'm a bluest soldier in all Germany
Though I'm blue I'm a gonna be true you'll just write to me
You gotta keep those cards and letters coming in honey
Say you love me time and time again honey
It's many a mile from Memphis to Berlin honey
So keep those cards and letters coming in
[ guitar - steel ]
Well you don't know how your letters tear me keep your mem'ry on my mind
Keep my heart from ever thinking about those cute frauleins
For every letter that you write me honey I'll write two
Keep let me know that you miss me so till I get home to you
You gotta keep those cards and letters...
You gotta keep those cards and letters..."
"[Blake]
Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whipper wheel started to sing
So I slipped down the hill
Got into the still
And drank til my ears started to ring
I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
Its my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
Its time that we got to no good
[Chorus: Both]
Now I ain't afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
[Miranda]
My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said that's where bad people go
But me and my sister been talkin'
Shes eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe
[Chorus]
[Blake]
Now I need a woman
[Miranda]
And I need a man
[Both]
We ain't got nobody
An' we ain't even kin
Now I ain't afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug
Come lay down on my bare skin rug"
"It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the Pumpkin Eater
And the party has just begun
I guess you're prince charming
Wasn't after all
'Cause he sure seemed different right after the ball
I guess that more than horses
Are turnin' into rats
And by the way he's walkin'
I can guess where your slippers at
It's midnight Cinderella
Time that you should know
There's gonna be some changes in the way this story goes
It's midnight Cinderella
But don't you worry none
'Cause I'm Peter, Peter the pumpkin eater
And the party has just begun
I'm gonna help you get over
Bein' under that spell
You're gonna learn to love midnight
Inside this pumpkin shell
I gotta few new magic tricks
Your Godmother can't do
And I'll show you want it means to bip, bip, bip, bip, boppity, boo hoo"
"I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always, always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but, always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
And, not for just a year, but, always"
"(Tell 'em that it comes and goes)
Everybody asks me if I still love you and if you're still on my mind
They ask me to tell 'em bout my broken heart I tell 'em that I'm feelin' fine
I lie a little bit and I proudly say our book of love is closed
And your memory seldom bothers me and when it does it comes and goes
It comes and goes all right it comes every morning and it goes all night
I say with lotta pride and I haven't really lied I just tell 'em that it comes and goes
(Tell 'em that it comes and goes)
Everybody asks me if I cried when you left and if I've cried for you since
They hope I have so they can all get together and laughin' up at my expense
So I lie a little bit and I proudly say not one teardrop flows
When there is a little pain it's not a constant pain it kinda just comes and goes
It comes and goes all right
I tell 'em that it comes and goes"
"Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
We'd find a place
In the sunshine
We'd be feeling good
Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
If all the squares
And the junkmen
Think you're out of line
Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man and
The whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld"
"On any given day I'll catch myself
Talking to yur memory that's all I have left
I miss you more than words can say
On any given day
Baby, on any given day goin' crazy alone
I'll happen by your place takin' the long way home
You'll drive me out of my way
On any given day
Once you hold an angel in your arms
It's the devil letting go
Just a taste of heaven on earth
Leaves a hunger in your soul
If I had three wishes, I'd throw away two
If I could be certain just one would come true
On any given day, I'd take one more night with you
Once you hold an angel in your arms
It's the devil letting go
Just a taste of heaven on earth
Leaves a hunger in your soul"
"Why do you like to roam if you've got so much love at home
What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
The whistle of a train does something to your brain
What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
I know you love me as much as you ever could love anyone yet you're still gone
You come back and you vow that you settle down now
Then you're gone with the dawn
Why do you like to roam if you've got so much love at home
What makes a man wander what makes a man wander
I know you love me as much
Why do you like to roam
What makes a man wander what makes a man roam"
"Never thought I'd miss that little old shack where I was born
Never thought I'd miss that little hick town
But then I never thought I'd wander quite this far away
Or my dreams would get turned quite this upside down
Home and things are heavy on my mind tonight
And I'd fly south if only I had wings
This big old world can make you miss the simple life you used to live
Oh, what I'd give to just see home and things
Things like my mama coolin' off her apple pies and the window sill
And dryin' her washin' on a limb from a hickory tree
Things like my daddy takin' his lunch to work in a paper sack
And tellin' all of his buddies how proud he is of me
Things like the preacher standin' in the pulpit early on Sunday morning
Preachin' to the sinners and leadin' everybody in a prayer
Oh, the sun was yellow and the grass was green
And the folks they were warm and friendly
And your soul could take
A good deep breath of God's fresh air
Home and things are heavy [unverified]
Home and things are heavy on my mind tonight"
"Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
I'm goin' to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I froze to death
Suzanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat that stood beside me
through the fray
Through the midnight moon
Saw fit to light my way
Got a lot left to say
But where do I go from here
When I'm lost out on the road
The way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Suzanna
Comin' down the hill
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
Says I'm comin' from the south
Suzanna don't you cry
Where do I go from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Suzanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I should surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Suzanna don't you cry"
"Donald and June enjoyed their brief honeymoon
Then they came home to lead the big baby boom
June wanted boys so Margie wore short hair and corduroys
Soon they had Claire then Linda and Louise a matching pair June liked boys
Donald and June they put some money aside
But all in four years they gave away three young brides
June spent it all Donald tried to keep each wedding small
When they were broke he offered Claire a thousand to elope Claire said Nope
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far
Donald and June had finally emptied their nest
They planned a long trip and then a couple years rest
But Claire had a spat and turned up with her suitcase and her cap
Marg moved next door now she won't need day care anymore and the twins had twins
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far
Donald and June enjoyed their brief honeymoon"
"To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do"
"I was scared but I couldn't admit it
Hatred planted out of fear
Fight or flight no choice but to hit it
The road, it calls on me my dear
I was lost as lost can be
Being praised for being found
But all that praise got lost on me
as the mood swing was headed down
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it
Your touch was nothing more than a child's goodbye and hello
But it always left me feeling worse when it was time to go
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it
And most of us out there got fooled as the gold, it glittered in the night
And we chased it fast like drunk buffoons
The banker lived, the artist died
And all our clothes were washed in grey
All our buildings and our cars
And the florescent lights of day bleached the sky and took the stars
Part from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me where I'm going
Apart you'll see how true it is and how back then
it possibly was impossible for you or me to know it"
"When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When you see that moon above don't just stand there
You gotta laugh and dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there
When the moon is shinin' bright in your Saturday night
You're not havin' any fun then maybe you're out with the wrong one
When you feel like you're in love hold her tighter
And the moon and stars above all shine brighter
You gotta laugh and dance and sing you gotta get that gal a ring
When you feel like you're in love don't just stand there

"Leaving here's been a long time coming
But I'm packed and my motor's running
There's nothing here I'm still needing
So I'm gonna let my heart lead me on
By the time you find me gone
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured out
I'm living my life now
No more wasting my time regretting
Just giving and never getting
I'm taking my change at winning
I'm making a new beginning now
And before the sun goes down
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured I'm living my life now
Everybody knows better what's better for me
And it's time that I'm breaking these chains so I can be free
I'll be living my life doing things my way
Taking the highway south
I lost my track but I'm getting it back
I've got it figured out
I'm living my life now"
"This could be our last goodnight together
We may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy 'till its over
Or forever
Please don't tell me how the story ends
See the way our shadows come together
Softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday this may be all
That we'll remember
Of each other
Please don't tell me how the story ends
Never's just the echo of forever
Lonesome as the love that might have been
Just let me go on loving and believing
'Till it's over
Please don't tell me how the story ends
Please don't tell me how the story ends"
"Take hold of my hand
And I'll do what I can
To make everything right
At least for tonight
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Press your lips against mine
And I promise to find
A way out of the pain
Some place safe from the rain
If you'll just press your lips against mine
I've lusted for love but lust is so blind
And trust for a heart is a hard thing to find
But what's left of yours might help to heal mine
Come and lay here by me
And I swear you will see
That the hurt from before
Don't live here no more
If you'll just come and lay here by me
I've lusted for love but lust is so blind
And trust for a heart is a hard thing to find
But what's left of yours might help to heal mine
Take hold of my hand
And I'll do what I can
To make everything right
At least for tonight
If you'll just take hold of my hand
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
If you'll just take hold of my hand
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Sha la la la la la
If you'll just take hold of my hand"
"The hopeful; the possibilities have come an' gone away.
We've both run out of reasons to stay.
Who we are and who we thought we were has somehow changed.
We kept tryin' anyway.
It's just not gonna work; it's just not gonna fly.
We've been frozen on the edge starin' at goodbye.
We've both reached for the stars;
Shared the victories, shared the scars;
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do my dreamin' without you.
Oh, you'll go one way an I'll go mine an' take some awkward steps.
Almost free except for these regrets; oh yeah.
An' movin' on's the only thing that we have left to do.
No-one can say we didn't see this through.
But it's just not gonna work; it's just not gonna fly.
We've been frozen on the edge starin' at goodbye.
We've both reached for the stars;
Shared the victories, shared the scars;
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do my dreamin' without you.
No.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you.
We've both reached for the stars;
Shared the victories, shared the scars;
Made each other's dreams come true.
I never thought I'd do, oh, my dreamin' without you.
Mmmm"
"We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee and we don't take trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
Cause we like living right and being free
And we don't make a party out of loving but we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Ol' Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
And I'm proud to be an OK
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all (in Muskogee Oklahoma USA)"
"I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
Shimmering lips that kiss me
And a body to make a fool of any man
I'd like to run away, but
I just haven't had all that I can stand
Our love is like the darkness,
It just keeps on getting deeper with the night
And though we'd never say ""I love you"",
You know it feels so good when we get it right
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
There's no reason for us to be here,
But we are and we have been for some time
Yeah, we both have other lovers, but
What they don't know they sure don't seem to mind
So we throw it to the wind
We don't worry bout these pleasures that we steal
'Cause there's oh so many reasons, but
It's really how we make each other feel
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways
I love you for all the wrong reasons
I need you every night and every day
Yes, I love you for all the wrong reasons
'Cause you love me in all the right ways..."
"People laugh and love and cry and I'm still missing you
The paper boy still comes around just like he used to do
But he's a little taller now and I'm still missing you
The leaves are piled against the fence the sky is hazy blue
There's talk about an early snow and I'm still missing you I'm still missing you
The swirling winds of time bring many changes
But for me they only blow across the surface of my heart
And they can't cool this memory of you that burns so deep inside me
Dick and Jane came by today their baby's almost due
People laugh and love and cry and I'm still missing you I'm still missing you"
"One more time
Yeah, that's what I said back a couple of times ago
Thank you
Kindly for reminding me I'm good to go
I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone, gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone, gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad
That's right
This party isn't all that it's cracked up to be
Yeah, boy
You gotta grab yourself a partner but don't look at me
I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone, gone
You'll never get it back
I'm gone, gone
Been a long time coming
Bet you're gonna miss me bad
Hey you
Yeah, you there with that smug look smeared across your face
That's right
I've got better things to do then hang around this place
I'm gone
And I'm taking all my good stuff
Gone, gone
You'll never get it back

"You close the door in front of me, I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage, and who's not being fair?
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there?
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in
Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one
But my heart, it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice calling out, and I'll cover up my ears
'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in"
"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail
Waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face
With my own destiny
Ohh, and we sat there talkin'
Just like we were old friends
And ohh, then I asked her
""Can I see you again?""
She said, ""Yes"" and I said, ""Wow""
And she said ""When?"" and I said, ""How about right now?""
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said ""Yes""
The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me
The man I wanna be
And she's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her it's just like breathing
It's easy and it obvious
She was made for me
Ohh, then it happened one night
Looking in her eyes
Ohh, and I popped the question
Much to my surprise
She said, ""Yes"" and I said, ""Wow""
And she said ""When?"" and I said, ""How about right now?""
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said ""Yes""
So we called the preacher
Family, and friends
And nothing's been the same
Since
She said, ""Yes"" and I said, ""Wow""
And she said ""When?"" and I said, ""How about right now?""
Love can't wait, then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said ""Yes"", she said ""Yes"""
"She's got tattoes on her backside and a car jacked up out front
my neighbor next door is an old old whore and she's off on a husband hunt
spends her days in the laundra mat washing and drying tube tops
i ain't real crazy about my old lady but i don't really think i'd swap
spends her nights in a strip joint doing an exotic dance in an out of date pair of platform shoes and worn out spandex pants
her kids still live with her mother and her step-brother who is unemployed
drives an old chartruse pinto, sleeps with a dude named Floyd
Chorus
She's a trailer park women
she's a mobile home princess
the queen of manufactored housing
she's a trailer park women
she's a mobile home princess and
me i'm the trailer park king
she's got a bad reputation she's the talk of the neighborhood
yea maybe her place ain't graceland but the furniture is just as good
i often stare in her window when she is getting dressed inside
but she don't mind she looks up to me cause i own a double wide
i got a concrete block foundation and it impresses her so
she always comes a-knocking whenever there's a tornado

"I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane"
"Hold up, there you go again
Puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this and doin' that
Always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break
So fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby, fall
Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder, let it fade away
And if you wanna let go, baby, it's okay
Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby, fall
Hold on, hold on, hold on to me
Fall, go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear
I'm right here
Baby, fall"
"It's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And it's too soon to know
Time passes slow, will I ever know
If I can forget her and not let it show?
It's too soon to know
News travels fast when love affair ends
People keep asking what happened to them
But it's too soon to know if I can forget her
My heart's been broken in too many pieces
And it's too soon to know"
"On top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for courtin' too slow
Oh courtin's a pleasure parting is grief
And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief
A thief will just rob you take all that you have
But false hearted lovers take you to your grave
The grave will decay you turn you into dust
And it just isn't one girl a poor boy can trust
[ steel ]
So come all you lovers and listen to me
Don't place your affection on a green willow tree
The leaves will all wither the roots will all die
Then you'll be forgotten but you'll never know why
On top of old Smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for a courtin' too slow"

Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
And I know I'm goin' home
Snowflakes a fallin'
My old home's a callin'
Tall pines a hummin'
Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringin'
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home
Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming
And I know I'm goin' home
Holly's in the window
Home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for runnin'

Can't you hear them bells ringin'
Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'
When it's snowin' I'll be goin'
Back to my country home

For the folks at home when

Bringin' joy to all, hear them singin'

"I can lose myself in the beauty of a song
I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly
I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind
I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while
In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you
I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake
And I can take December and turn it into June
In my mind I can be anything I want to be..."
"Well the hammer fell down on a forty-four primer
Now there's one less problem in South Carolina tonight
Wrong or right
She just looked at me as she finished her tale
And her blank expression went another shade pale of grey
There was nothin' to say
In the shadows of her face, I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said
Don't you sit and judge me
From some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug off
Until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
'Cause there are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play
Well I put the cuffs on her
And I put her in the car
And I walked in and he was on the floor
Stone dead
Shot in the head
There were whiskey bottles and dope by his chair
And a starving baby with nothin' to wear
But tears
You know, the picture was clear
He had finally pushed her farther than the line
And the badge I wore had lost all of it's shine
Don't you sit and judge me
From some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug off
Until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
'Cause there are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play
Well I stood there thinkin' how justice was blind
But I didn't see any and I could see just fine
And I made up my mind
So I took the cuffs off her
And I took her back in
I wiped off the gun
And wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been
And the morning paper told in black and white
Just another senseless case of suicide
Oh, just a suicide
Oh but don't you sit and judge me
From some high and mighty seat
Don't you shrug off
Until you've walked a mile on my beat
'Cause there are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play
Yeah the hammer fell down on a forty-four primer
Now there's one less problem in South Carolina tonight"
"Oh, it's going down the road feeling bad
Bad luck's all I've ever had

This old jailer he sure is hard to please
Feed me corn, bread and peas, Lord, Lord
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

Lord, she's left me with these lonesome jailhouse blues
My sweet mama won't buy me no shoes, Lord, Lord

There's no burden like the love you make me live without

More and more, every day,
As heaven would miss the stars above,
With every heartbeat
I still think of you,
And remember our faded love.
I think of the past
And all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat
I still think of you
And remember our faded love"

You said that you was gonna laugh every time I cried

I just can't sleep no more

He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind"
"It must be winter in my heart
There's nothing warm in there at all
I miss the summer and the spring
The floating, yellow leaves of fall
A million colors fill my eyes
The roman candles and the stars
Calendar says July 4th
But it's still winter in my heart
They say flowers bloom in spring
Red and golden, blue and pink
They say seasons turn in time
Theirs our changing, why won't mine?
It must be winter in my heart
There's nothing warm in there at all
I miss the summer and spring
The floating, yellow leaves of fall
The air in there is frigid cold

They say flowers bloom in spring
Red and golden, blue and pink
They say seasons turn in time
Theirs our changing, why won't mine?
It must be winter in my heart
It must be winter in my heart
It must be winter in my heart
It must be winter in my heart

Love is a sometimes thing...

I sing for my
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
This old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Hey, Georgia, oh, yeah, yeah, Georgia
And a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly, yeah
Still in peaceful dreams I see
On another road, it leads back to you
Hey, Georgia, I say oh, Georgia
No, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song, God is this song long
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
Busy road, the road leads back to you now
Oh, Georgia, don't do that, had to know well
No peace I find, won't you hear me now
It's just an old sweet song, I said, oh, I said that
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind, yeah, it won't be so
Keeps Georgia on my mind
You know the little girls that are on my mind
Yes, it is"
"You can't see a mem'ry of love trhat's untrue hear a tearfall or a heart break in two
You can't draw on paper the picture of pain
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappers when it dies
A heart sheds no tears still you know that it cries
You can't see how empty a soul is inside
There are some things words just won't describe

You can't see the future though you've known the past
Or know how long a love hurt will last
Blue mem'ries burn though you don't see the flame
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappers...
There are some things you just can't explain"
"The strangest thing in all the world is a heart so small
It will just keep right on breaking if you ever let it fall
And I guess I've never known how to solve the mystery
Oh how a thing so tiny could control so much of me
A little bitty love can grow the strongest
A little bitty time away from you can be the longest
Oh how I wish I had never come to know how a little bitty heart can break so big
I wish that I could find a way to get a heart that's new
I would lock it deep inside me just out of reach of you
But I guess there is no way how to solve the mystery
Oh how a thing so tiny could control so much of me
A little bitty love can grow
How a little bitty heart can break so big"

Gettin' stoned all alone
On my favorite memory
Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
I'll start with lovin' you
But I don't know when to stop"
"Can you smell that McDonell it don't smell so well
Or the one in the cage tipped over and fell
And if we lived to see Sunday be able to tell
Of the terror below and the place we call Hell
'Cause it's a shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
Now I fear for my children, I fear for my wife
And if I don't make it back now I've had a good life
For there's a cave in behind us only one way to go
Down deep in the shaft so far below
'Cause it's the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
What do you say to a family of one
Who don't come back up with the rest
Is it better to let them just mourn by themselves
Or tell 'em he was one of the best
There's a flash above head, is it fire or light
McDonell lies seethin' the draggers in sight
And a few hours later we'll be smellin' sweet air
With all of our children the stores we'll share
Of the shaft that will feed us and the shaft that will kill
Our brothers and fathers who die by her will
The fishing is slow and there's work to be done
So I'll put on my hat and I'll go underground
So I put on my hat and I go underground"
"You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and
I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore"
"Folks in Nashville slammed the door
Said we don't want you anymore
Find your own way down the road
Pack your fiddle and your guitar
Take a train or take a car
Find someone else to keep you from the cold
Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride
Oh, he always sang the blues
Like it was all he ever knew
He didn't sing at all that night
He was pale and as he dozed
He didn't know his time had closed
Slumped in the back seat to the right
Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride
So they send him on night train south
Through the cities and the rural routes
Just one more place to go
Ah, the whistle sang the bluest note
Like it came from his own throat
Moanin' sad and cryin' low
Rollin' and ramblin'
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a child's
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride
Rollin' and ramblin'
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobo's drifted up the rail
He's taken his last ride, oh, oh, oh"
"You took me out so far that i can't swim to shore
I've been holding on but you're not anymore
Our love would always lead us home
Constant as the northern star
Here's a storm we won't get through cause it's not in your heart
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If i could be what's missing, that's all i'd want to be
I can feel you drifting
In the silence that's become the company we keep
I've realized how far we are from what we used to be
Part of you has gone somewhere i can't seem to touch
I could stay and take what's left, but baby, that's not us
I can feel you drifting slowly out of reach
Out there in the distance, there's something else you need
If i could be what's missing, that's all i'd want to be
I can feel you drifting"
"There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
I'm as low as they come
I'm what shouldn't be done
Filthy and lost
Still up for trying
You're the one reason why
I look up and smile
Wishing alone
And I'm ready to forge ahead
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
Dark thoughts are hidden
Masked in the shadows
Times they estrange
Colors are full
We all will fit in
Climb in our armor
Traveling fast
The judgement is past
Now it's time to go on
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night
Limbs that won't turn
When the fire won't burn
Like it did when we felt it
Deep in our hearts
Untie the rudder
Guide them away
Take me off sir
Take me off sir
There is a sea and I am a captain
Of something unknown, waves high as mountains
There is a key and there is a lie
Here's to times that I catch it
May it last through the night"
"Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashin' everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water
On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And your a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water
Oh let'er go boys
Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue
You can stay right there
When the daylight's gone
Play truth or dare
And it won't take long
'Fore you and her got nothin' on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water"
"They say there he sits in his big white wicker rocker
Eatin' candy coated cashews sippin' orange lemonade
While a sweet young thing fans the flies from off his eyebrows
He's dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Lord they say that Jesse Langtree's got it made
A little bit south of the Okechobee there's a story that the swamp folks tell
About a mean old man named Jesse Langtree
And a sweet young maid and a bottomless well
That water's cold but that don't matter how deep it is no one can tell
Just drop a stone you'll never hear it splatter
It just falls down down forever in the bottomless well
Through fifteen miles of snakes and gators
With the raging fever and the trembling chills
I wandered lost through the Okechobee
And there I seen 'em sittin' there by the bottomless well
Yeah now there he sits...
(Oh let's hear it for Jesse now hey Jesse)
I asked her for a drink of water and as Jesse slept me and her we talked a spell
She said that she was his wife and daughter Lord Lord
But his heart was cold cold and dark as the bottomless well
And as he slept I bent to kiss her I heard a loud and jealous yell
Felt my head explode in darkness two big hairy arms picked me up
And dragged me to the bottomless well
I woke up in fear and trembling I was staring down into the jaws of hell
As he held me high above his shoulders
A gonna throw me down down down to the bottomless well
Now here I sit in Jesse's big white wicker rocker
Eatin' his candy coated cashews sippin' his orange lemonade
While that sweet young thing fans the flies from off my eyebrows
I'm dozin' in the green catalpa shade
Enjoying things that Jesse Langtree made oh God bless you Jesse
Now some folks say that sweet thing pushed him but I was there and I'd swear he fell
But it ain't murder cause he ain't dead cause he's still a fallin'
Goin' down down forever in the bottomless well
Goin' down down down down down bye Jesse"
"I'm a lone country mile from bein' style
Dirty hat an cowboy boots
I cut my teeth on them old outlaw songs
My daddy used to listen to
Guess it's in my genes

And when I do I drink too much
Wind up on my back

You can polish up an shine me but the real things gonna shine through

"Red light traffic standing still
Keeping me from you
Tough days always in this town but this one will soon be through
Cause right around the bend on the porch there by the drive
There's an angel out there waiting to bring me back to life
She always saves me from all of my crazy
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
So I need to be on my way
Red to green and finally I'm moving again
Faster than this backbone should be traveling
Up ahead I see her hand waiving in the air
Faded cut back denim and tangled auburn hair
She opens up the door
All I want and more
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
Where I need to be on my way
She can't sit still for the thrill of the night that's coming on
It's only a matter of time until my troubles are gone
Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
Oh can't you see I'm on my way
I'm on my way"
"Well hello there come on in I'm expecting you my friend
Yes you came to see the house that is for sale
All the neighbors are so fine they're the friendly helpfull kind
There's so many extras here that you'll enjoy
See the fireplace in the den have the bar she had filled in
And the paintings aren't they pretty on the wall
All the curtains and the shades all she had them custom made
You can have them don't want nothing left at all
A home where love once lived and died where a million mem'ries hide
It revolves to talk a story they could tell
Now a stranger came to town and my world came tumbling down
Now our home is just a pretty house for sale

A home where love once lived...
Yes our home is just a pretty house for sale"
"I've walked the straight and narrow and I've worn a rebel's brand
Sometimes I've had to go without for bein' my own man
I've rallied to the cause when I knew the cause was right
I've cut against the grain, but I've kept my peace of mind
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad until my dyin' day
I wouldn't have it any other way
Oh, I wouldn't have it any other way
I could have taken a beaten path every time trouble starts
I'd rather take a beatin' than to ever cross my heart
Stickin' to my guns, can't be sold or bought
Holdin' to my honor no matter what the cost
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me, that's one I'll have to pay

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

"I'm tempted my darling, to steal you away,
Don't let me crossover, stay out of my way.
You know that I love you, and I'm not the stealing kind,
But I'm faced with heartaches, at love's cheating line.
Chorus:
Don't let me crossover, loves cheating line,
You belong to another, and could never be mine.
I know one step closer, would be heaven divine,
Don't let me crossover, loves cheating line.
I tried to forget you, but what else can I do,
When your eyes keep saying, that you love me too.
I know if I lose you, not a dream will I have left,
I don't want to cheat dear, but I can't help myself.

You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten

I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on"

Lord, she could

I, I had me a boy
Who buttoned me down
Threw me a line
He, he washed me as clean
As a sinner could be
Showed me the light
Ooo that boy, he taught me to pray
But for all of his spit-shinin' ways
Lord, he could
Oooooooo
Ooooooohhhhohhhh
Ooooooo
Ooooohhhhhhhhhh
I had me a girl
Like cigarette smoke
She came and she went
I slipped through his hands
To my back door man
Under his chin
Oh that woman taught me to pray
But for all her wandering ways
She could

Ooooooohhhhohhhh
Ooooooo

With that look on his face

He's a bad one him always breakin the law

Couple out of town boys lookin for a fight
It was 2 on 1 but Jack evened the score

Aint that what the old folks say
Dont go lookin, dont go lookin for trouble

Heres some thread and a needle in case you do

"When you're sittin' with your honey just as cozy as can be
And you ask her can I kiss you once or twice
If she doesn't make you kiss but she quickly answers yes
That do make it nice
When you take her to a party and the fellows buzz her down
But she holds 'em off and treats some cold as ice
Then she gets you all alone whispers honey take me home
That do make it nice
When you say goodnight and you hold her tight
While you're standing at her front door
When you want to stay and she says okay
She let's you stay a couple of kisses more man you're livin'
If she doesn't care for diamonds or a lotta fancy things
'Cause she understands you haven't got the price
And just being by your side keeps her more than satisfied
That do make it nice
On the night you meet her parents and her daddy shakes your hand
And her mother looks you over once or twice
Dawn and evening's just begun if they start to call you son
That do make it nice
When you wanna pop the question but you're feelin' kinda shy
'Cause you wonder if she'll go for shoes or rice
While you're planning everything she goes out and buys the ring
Ha ha ha ha that do make it nice"
"In the stillness of the dawn
Our love is dead and gone
The sunrise warms my heart
With memories of you
It's the sweetest thing--remembering
There's a picture in the hall
That I'm leaving on the wall
'Cause there's a look in your eyes
That always made me fall apart
It's the sweetest thing--remembering
When I close my eyes to cry
I can't help but feel a smile
'Cause I think of you and I forget
It hurt to say goodbye
But after all we've been through
It's amazing to me
The sweetest thing's remembering
Oh the sweetest thing--remembering
We wanted love to last forever
And the good lord knows we tried
But when the rain came pouring down
There was no place left to hide
But after all we've been through
It's amazing to me
The sweetest thing's remembering
Oh the sweetest thing--remembering
It's the sweetest thing--remembering"
"The right to remain silent, perfect stranger
Can I have this dance my you're looking pretty
Is there something wrong did he leave you hurting
I don't mean to pry but that tear in your eye gave you away
If you don't want to talk we'll keep it quiet
But sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it
I think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain
You have the right to remain silent
Anything that you say as I hold you against me
Will forever be a secret between us two
I've been wanting you but you didn't know it
And now that he's gone at last I can show it
If your heart is tired for the rest of your life
Lay your love on me
So many times my eyes have held you
Tonight please give my arms that chance
If you don't feel the need for conversation
We'll just let our hearts talk while we dance"
"Verse One:
Alarm clock rings, can't hit the snooze,
Too much to do and no time to lose,
Fly out of my bed and into my shoes,
Hit the door, on the move,
Cell phone rings, it never ends,
One more thing if I can work it in,
I'm running a rat race that I can't win,
This big ole world takes another spin,
Then I do it all again,
Chorus:
I spent all my time making time,
To work on life's assembly line,
Try to find one more minute,
Squeeze one more thing in it,
On track for a heart attack,
If I don't do some kicking back,
Now I think it's high time,
To make a little more time for that,
Verse Two:
I got a great big list in front of me,
Things to do, folks to see,
I'm checkin them off one-two-three,
Dot the I's and cross the T's,
I just wanna get home to you,
And get right back to my honey do's,
Take a look, enjoy the view,
Catch a game, take a snooze,
Anything I choose,
Chorus:
I spent all my time making time,
To work on life's assembly line,
Try to find one more minute,
Squeeze one more thing in it,
On track for a heart attack,
If I don't do some kicking back,
Now I think it's high time,
To make a little more time,
For king pole, napping by a fishin' hole,
Slow it all down to a crawl,
For a Sunday drive gettin' lost in my baby's eyes,
And I might even try doing nothing at all,
Chorus:
I spent all my time making time,
To work on life's assembly line,
Try to find one more minute,
Squeeze one more thing in it,
On track for a heart attack,
If I don't do some kicking back,
Don't you think it's high time,
To make a little more time for that,
Don't you think it's high time,
Yeah I need a little more time for that."
"Workin' hard all my life
Always tried to get it right
Every day and every night
Hey hey hey carry me home
Singin' in a honky tonk
People dancin' getting drunk
Never knowin' what I want
Hey hey hey carry me home
I just want a little
Give me just a little
Just a little piece of mind
Can't somebody tell me
Please somebody tell me
How long does this road unwind
Sis white Cadillacs
Crossin' on the railroad track
Angels in the front and back
Hey hey hey carry me home"
"It happens to a mother
She is giving birth
Her heart is filled with joy
While her body's filled with hurt
She holds the baby close to her
Despite the pain he caused
When it comes to love, you don't count the cost
It happens to a soldier
Fighting for his home
Fear wells up inside him
And yet he still goes on
Even though he knows
He may be the next to fall
When it comes to love, you don't count the cost
You don't count the heartache
You don't count the sacrifice
All that counts is what you feel inside
It doesn't really matter what is gained or what is lost
When it comes to love, you don't count the cost
It happens all around us
Each and every day
Someone's giving all they got
For someone else's sake
If you ever doubt it
Just think about the cross
When it comes to love, you don't count the cost"

But I can't stop believing
Hanging on to what we got
Is still a better way to go
Than leaving
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go
So please don't let this be the end
Hold out some hope that we can try again
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go"
"Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy had a hand in a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus:
Well the ""G"" men, ""T"" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
--- Instrumental ---
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
Shhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus:
Well the ""G"" men, ""T"" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Well a city slicker came and he said ""I'm tough""
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff
He took one g-g-glug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'
Chorus:
Well the ""G"" men, ""T"" men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
but my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'..."
"When we're all alone dear and I'm in your arms are you teasing me
When you're telling me how you thrill to my charms are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you when we're apart are you free
Tell me darling while our love is still young are you teasing me
[ steel ]
You tell me my love could make your life complete are you teasing me
And near from my arms would you long to be free are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you when we're apart are you free
Oh tell me darling while our love is still young are you teasing me"
"You asked me if I had to pick
What would my favorite flower be
And as for my response
I thought about it very carefully
I ain't one for ""two-lips"",
I already have those,
And I'd want a silver wedding band,
So baby, not ""marrygolds"",
I don't need a buttercup
to know that I have luck, I have you,
And I'm hydrated and healthy
So forget the ""IV""
Black-Eyed Susans remind me of a bully I once knew,
And while we're on the subject let's cross off pansies too.
So yeah roses really are red,
And violets are so very blue,
But you can forget about the bouquet,
Because no matter what day, it's true
I'll always pick you.
You'd make me think we're a was,
If you got ""begone-ias"",
And I've got a loud mouth but not a green thumb,
so I hate keeping ""mum"".
I don't mind ""lie-lacs"",
But I'd rather stay honest,
Jasmine's nice but I prefer Pocahontas.
You say forget me not- you know I won't ever,
And we can save ""or kid"" as a future endeavor,
And while we're on the subject of family trees,
Let's add to the list ""baby's breath"" and ""poppies"".
And I don't like words that I can't spell,
So that means rhododendrons are incontrovertibly out as well.
So yeah roses really are red,
And violets are so very blue,
But you can forget about the bouquet,
Because no matter what day, it's true
I'll always pick you.
I'm not a fan of sweetpea or brussel sprout,
""car""nations are ""auto""matically out.
I like the hill not so much the valley, so lets just add lily to the tally,
And ""Queene Anne can keep her Lace"" it was ""for Sythia"" anyways.
I got two sisters not ""tuberose"" from my paps,
And Edelweiss was taken by the Von Trapps,
The bird of paradise can stay in his tree and take the snapdragon with it cuz they ain't for me,
The guy who named sunflowers had his physics askew,
Because we'd all explode if the sun ever grew.
(it makes me nervous)
But sure roses really are red,
And violets are so very blue,
But you can forget about the bouquet,
Because no matter what day, it's true
I'll always pick you."
"We three kings of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I my gift of love and sacrifice
Pray'r and praising all men raising worship in God most high
Oh star of wonder star of night..."
"Before the ice was broken
I thought it was only me
Before the words were spoken
We crept into other dreams
Now our shadows whisper
We're getting closer
We know we're falling
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the ground
Don't try to understand it
The pleasure is worth the fear
They'll watch us launch our rockets
We'll grow wings and disappear
Cause our shadows whisper
We're getting closer
We know we're falling
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the ground
We can go on forever
We can go on forever
We can go on 'til we hit the ground"
"Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I'm tempted, my darling
To steal you away
Don't let me cross over
Stay out of my way
You know that I love you
And I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartaches
And love's cheating line
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And can never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I've tried to forget you
But what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying
That you love me too
I know if I lose you
Not a dream will be left
I don't want to cheat dear
But I can't help myself
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And can never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line"
"You're the hand that waved goodbye you're the tears that fill my eyes
You're the love I had that went wrong
You're the lump that fills my throat and when I sing you're my blue note
And baby you're the sad in my song
I've often wondered why when people sing they cry
I didn't know that love could go wrong
But now I've sadly learned I'm among the hearts that yearn
Because darling you're the sad in my songs
[ dobro ]
You're the pain that's in my heart and you're the hours we spend apart
You're the sleep I never find all night long
You're the lips I used to kiss and you're the girl that I still miss
Darling you're the sad in my song
I've often wondered why..."
"Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein, Fraulein
Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you"
"Precious Lord take my hand lead me on let me stand
I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storm through the night lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
When my way groweth drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry hear my call hold my hand last I fall
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
When the darkness appears and the night draweth near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand guide my feet hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
(Lead me home)"
"Tonight doesn't feel like it did last night
I'm feeling warm and different inside
Since I saw your face
Since I looked in your eyes
There's a change in this place
I think the love factor's high
[Chorus]
When the love factor's high
And too hard to collide
You don't even try
And that's when you'll find
The one that feels right
The one for all time
It's hard to deny
When the love factor's high
Sometimes it flies and sometimes it falls
Sometimes your back
Ends up against the wall
As I hold you close
We dance in time
And I think I know the love factor's high
[Chorus]"
"A little boy not much more than a baby
Found a rose and picked it like a child would do
Proudly he went running to his mommy
And with a grin he said, ""Look what me find for you""
A teenage boy packed groceries at the market
A rebel kid sometimes a little wild
But every year on Mother's Day and birthdays
He'd bring her a rose just like that little child
A single crimson rose
In time became a symbol of
Endless love shared between
A mother and her son
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
At eighteen, he enlisted in the army
To fight a war he felt needed to be won
Sometimes he'd write on Mother's Days and birthdays
He never failed to send a rose to mom
That soldier now is coming home a hero
With his medals to the mother that he loves
With tear-filled eyes, she tells him how she's missed him
And on his casket lays a single crimson rose
A single crimson rose
In time became a symbol of
Endless love shared between
A mother and her son
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
A single crimson rose
Was a special way to say
I'll always love you come what may
A single crimson rose
A little boy not much more than a baby
Found a rose and picked it like a child would do"
"When the sun comes up and it's time to get up in the mornin'
Will you think of me and how it ought a be in the mornin'
Well I don't know why you could say goodbye
And I can't see how you could be anywhere but here with me in the mornin'
Where was I when you made your move to go away
Where was I I didn't hear the things I've always heard or always said
Well it's no lie I never thought about it not a day
And I'll tell you why I really thought we always tried to say what should be said
When the sun comes up"
"Condemned without trial no chance to explain
Sentenced to be lonely despised
Condemned without trial to heartaches and pain
I thought that you demand me from the life
As heaven's my judge and the world is my jury
I'm faithful I swear that I am
Condemned without trial someday you may be
Then you'll think of me and understand
[ guitar - piano ]
As heavens my chance..."
"Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song
(One, two, three, four)
There's a seven-forty-seven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whisky power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home
'Cause we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Yeah, don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Oh, yeah, we're just getting started"
"Have you heard there's a place called the Young Land
Where a kiss is worth more than pure gold
Lovers walkin' in hand in search of this land
Where true love will never grow old
Ask me how do I know of the Young Land
Well now I've had a love of my own
But she left me one day now I can't find my way
So I'll search for the Young Land alone
Lovers who seek soon find
That the Young Land's a state of mind
Take a word from the wise and be careful
To be sure and love all you can
Where the love you can share you will find everywhere
Everywhere in the world is a Young Land
Everywhere in the world is a Young Land"
"Oh my darling, I miss you so.
How I loved you, you'll never know.
Though it's time for me to let you go.
Oh my darling, I'll miss you so.
Can't believe you're really gone for good.
I still hold on to places you once stood.
I should move on, but I never could,
Really believe you're gone for good.
Oh my friend, what could I do?
I just came home to bury you.
The road is long, the road is rough.
Your in my heart, that's not close enough.
All those years, disappear
All my tears, are not enough, not enough.
How can it be the ties that bind,
Cut down deep and are so unkind?
When we lose them we will never find,
Anything stronger than the ties that bind."
"I'll give you three guesses who loves you
Who's loved you right from the start
And not your mother who likes to baby you so
And not the boy back home you used to know oh no
There's somebody special who needs you together or apart
Bet you don't need three guesses and not even two
To know that I'm the one sweetheart
[ guitar ]
Oh yes there's somebody special..."
"You're gettin' heavy on my mind you've made me warmer than the sunshine
I think about you all the time you're gettin' heavy on my mind
Not long ago it seemed impossible for me to fall in love again
But lately it's been hard for me to think of you as just a friend
You're gettin' heavy on my mind
Well only thing that love has given me is loneliness and sleepless nights
But something has been telling me to give my heart another try
You're gettin' heavy on my mind
You're gettin' heavy on my mind"
"(David Olney)
Man you should have seen me way back then
I could tell a tale, I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why
Back then I could really tel a lie
Well I'd hire a kid to say he was lame
Then I'd touch him and make him walk again
Then I'd pull some magic trick I'd pretend to heal the sick
I was takin' everything they had to give
It wasn't all that bad a way to live
Well I'm in this desert town and it's hot as hell
But no one's buyin' what I got to sell
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
I'm preachin' up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that I'm only wasting time
So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
You're pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin' else
Instead of callin' out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And I'll tell you somethin' funny He didn't want nobody's money
Now I'm not exactly sure what this all means
But it's the damndest thing I swear I've ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I can't make a dime, I don't know why I came
I decide I'll go and find him And find out who's behind him
He has everyone convinced that he's for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says I'll get paid off on down the line
Well I guess I'll string along Don't see how too much can go wrong
As long as he pays my way I guess I'll follow
We're headed for Jerusalem tomorrow"
"Got a little story for you
(bet it's about a woman)
Listen up
Let's begin with the day I met her
And how fast this good ol' boy's world got better
The sky got bluer the grass got greener
In just the first few seconds after I first seen her
Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump-shot that's nothin' but net
She's a handful of aces when the dealer's done dealin'
And I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feelin'
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money
She's the best cook that ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect
She's right on the money"
"I heard the bells on Christmas Day their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought as now this day had come the belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head there is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep God is not dead nor doth he sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men"
"I had the world in my hand when you were in my arms
And our love seems to grow everyday
Then like a fool I wasn't true brought shame and hurt to you
Now the time has come for me to pay
Now the whole world is empty without you you're my life my dreams and my plans
I'll do anything to make it up to you and put back my ring on your hand
[ fiddle ]
There was a time I made you cry each time you said goodbye
And walked away leaving me all alone
I broke your heart hurt your pride and now you're not here by my side
Now I see I've done the same thing to me
Now the whole world is empty..."
"I'm out walking in dark alleys
Searching for shadows in the valleys
You were my Heaven, you were my home
So what am I supposed to do when Heaven is gone?
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
I've heard stories 'bout honky tonk angels
Picking up pieces of broken strangers
I'm at rock bottom with a smoke and a sin
When the party is over, then I'm lonely again
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
If I can't see the light
In the neon glow
If there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?
No, there ain't enough whiskey
To kill the fire in my soul
If the devil don't want me
Where the hell do I go?"
"Yippee-yay there'll be no wedding bells, for today
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Lily Bell, oh, Lily Bell,
Though I may have done some foolin, this is why I never fell
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Mary Ann, oh, Mary Ann
Though I've done some moonlight walking this is why I up and went
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Sally Jane, oh, Sally Jane
Though I'd love to stay forever this is why I can't remain
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad, you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
Oh, Bessy Lou, oh, Bessy Lou
Though we've done a heap of dreamin' this is why it won't come true
I got spurs that jingle, jangle, jingle
As I go ridin' merrily along
And they sing, 'Oh ain't you glad, you're single'
And that song ain't so very far from wrong
So I'll go jingling, a-jangling a-jingling along"
"We were twins to be born that day
But I could never let it be that way
Mama's life line proved a good noose
With a taste for killing, I was on the loose
My folks hated me for what I did that day
So I slit their throats, sent 'em to their grave
I headed for the Smokie's in Tennessee
Yeah, lot of good killing was ahead of me
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Met a mountain girl from a mining town
Our first time when the sun went down
All she wanted was to marry me
So I cut her where she loved me
And watched her bleed
Her daddy from the holler saw her blood so red
So I drug him in the river and I drowned him dead
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
Wore out my welcome in Arkansas
Killed a Christian family of the Pentecost
Georgia Cracker was a talking at me
So I cut out his tongue, hung from a tree
Now the southern law wants to put me in jail
But I'll still be killing when I'm burning in hell
I'm a killer on the lamb
Hey, I don't mind living with some blood on my hands
Your life to me ain't worth a damn
To this killer on the lamb
To this killer on the lamb
To this killer on the lamb"
"There's a lot of strange men in cell Block 10 but the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who just spent his time staring at the wall
(Staring at the wall)
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote and it proved that crime don't pay
Twas the very same gal he robbed and stole for name in her weddin' day
(Name in her weddin' day)
As he looked at the wall so strong and tall I could hear him softly curse
Nobody a tall ever climbed that wall but I'm gonna be the first
(I'm gonna be the first)
The warden walked by and said son don't try I would hate to see you fall
There is no doubt they would carry you out if you ever touch that wall
(Ever touch that wall )
A year's gone by since he made his try but I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died but he never made that wall
(Never made that wall)
There's never been a man ever shook this can but I know a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan but I know it was suicide
Know it was suicide"
"The moon hid its light and the midnight was still
And they had their last quarrel on top of the hill
And she said to him, please, as they stood in the mist
If we must part this way, come, give Jeannie one last kiss
But in anger he turned, with no kiss and no care
There she stood on the cliff, with the wind in her hair
The next mornin' they learned that his Jeannie was dead
Girl climbin' and slipped, all the newspapers said
Then night after night, when the moon hides its light
The wind's in the mist, seem to cry out his name and call him again
Come, give Jeannie one last kiss
Years have gone by and they talk of him still
And the voice that was callin' from the top of the hill
And they tell of the night that he ran from his door
How he ran toward the cliff, then was heard from, no more
Now, night after night, when the moon hides its light
And the wind's in the mist, all the old people swear
That he's out there somewhere"
"I thought if you weren't busy we might have lunch tomorrow
And talk about a few things laying heavy on my mind
I'll get the corner table in that cozy little cafe
Where we used to go back in the better times when you are mine
The years rolled by like thunder, we're not getting any younger
And I think it's time I made a few amends
I'd like to look you in the eyes and tell you I apologize
Besides I want us to be friends
[Chorus]
Forgiveness, this phone call's all about forgiveness
It's too late to work things out for me and you
But there's still somethings I feel I've got to do
Like say 'I'm sorry' and ask forgiveness
I could make up a lot of excuses for the way that I acted
I could blame it on impatiences, arrogance or on my youth
But the bottom line is I was simply a fool
And there is no excuse for the truth
But I just wanna make sure that
Before any more water runs under the bridge
And anymore time passes us by that you understand
How much I regret everything that happened
That I still love you and I will till the day that I die
[Chorus]
Forgiveness, this phone call's all about forgiveness"
"I love to say your name even when you're not around
I just love the way it sounds it's music to me
I love to dream of you even when I'm not asleep
Baby your love just keeps gettin' deeper in me
Darlin' you are always there
No matter where I am you're never far away from me
And baby you are always there
You're everywhere and you've become a part of me
[ piano ]
When I have to leave your side you know it doesn't worry me
I've got your love inside of me each and every day
When I have to face the world you know I'll feel so secure
Cause baby I know for sure you're with me all the way
Darlin' you are always there..."
"Well it was Sunday morning, past Saturday night
And I was sneakin' out my door
I slipped on my best Sunday dress
And I was ready for a little bit more
It's shiny red like the sheets on my bed
It might turn a head or two
It's no mystery the man's history
And I'm ready for something new
Well I've been looking all around this whole damn town
And I've got my eyes on you
And if you're lookin' for adventure and a little romance
Baby, baby let me lay it out for you
Oh I know you know what I'm talkin' about
'Cause you're grinnin' like a crocodile
Yeah think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Eye to eye, face to face, dancin' around all over the place
Oh I know you know what I'm talkin' about
'Cause you ain't no baby child
Hey, think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Hey come a little closer, they're playin' our song
We're a couple of shootin' stars
Take a trip around the world a time or two
Take a rocket ship to Mars
We don't have to be angels to spread our wings
Defy the laws of gravity
Oh the atmosphere is so sweet up here
Oh darling, we were meant to be
Well I've been looking all around this whole damn town
And I've got my eyes on you
And if you're lookin' for adventure and a little romance
Baby, baby let me lay it out for you
Oh I know you know what I'm talkin' about
'Cause you ain't no baby child
Hey, think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Go wild
Hey think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Eye to eye, face to face, dancin' around all over the place
Oh I know you know what I'm talkin' about
'Cause you're grinnin' like a crocodile
Yeah think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Yeah think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Yeah think about it sugar, honey let your mind go wild
Go wild, go wild"
"There was a time when I thought of no other and we sang our own love's refrain
Our hearts beat as one and we had our fun but time changes everything
When you left me my poor heart was broken our romance it seemed all in vain
The dark coulds're gone and there's blue skies again
'Cause time changes everything
Time has passed I've forgot you mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you 'cause time changes everything
You change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it a swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything
Good luck to you may God bless you I can't say I won't love again
But you go your way and now I'll go mine cause time changes everything"
"She puts up with my coffee cup
Ringing her dining room table
And she don't mind those Friday nights
When she has to drive 'cause I'm unstable
She goes to church while I oversleep
I'm not sure what she sees in me
Thank God for small favors
Sunday paper and the taste of homemade wine
Second chances and the healing hands of time
Thank God love is blind
Somehow she knows, I love her so
Though I don't always show her
She only sees the good in me
But with me she has to look closer
Lord, I guess I owe you one
She thinks I hung the moon and the sun
Thank God for small favors
Sunday paper and the taste of homemade wine
Second chances and the healing hands of time
And thank God love is blind
Thank God for small favors
Sunday paper and the taste of homemade wine
Second chances and the healing hands of time
And thank God love is blind"
"Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ry of her lingers ev'rywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care
But if she's happy thinkin' I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh where would she get such an idea
Just because I ask a friend about her
And just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care
She thinks I still care"
"One among the three of us is always in the way
People talk but still I walk like a queen with all her charms
When I'm alone I know what's wrong he's somewhere in your arms
Don't know my friend where this will end but all we have to say
Yes one among the three of us is always in the way
One among the three of us is always in the way
Yesterday I was the one so today must be my day
There'll come a time these tangled minds will all have dues to pay
Cause one among the three of us is always in the way
He tells me that he loves me and that his love is true
But he tells me the same old thing but he can't be true to two
Oh it's a cryin' shame but we're all to blame in this crazy game we play
Cause one among the three of us is always in the way
One among the three of us..."

Well Duggan was a purebred hill country kicker
He loved to shoot his pistols
And he loved to drink his liquor
His daddy had long since given up on tryin'
To tame him
He knew he hated sweatin' in the fields
He couldn't blame him
But when his only son robbed the Chillicothe Flyer
He guessed the days were numbered
Till he'd have to face the fire
Well Duggan rode up to the house
His pa ran out to meet him
He said ""Son, why'd you do it?""
Duggan said ""I had my reasons""
His daddy told him, ""Boy, you've always been
So full of juice, but any day your neck
It will be hangin' in a noose.""
Duggan winked and mounted, stirred his
Horse into a lather
He never looked back... guess it really didn't matter
It wasn't too long till a team of Texas Rangers
Pounded on the door, man, faces
Filled with anger
Duggan's papa opened up, said ""No need to shout,
I don't know where he is
But I know what he's all about.""
He likes to dance out to the edge
He likes to cut to the chase
You see he's never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where he's bound
Well, boys, I just can't respond
But from the look in his eyes
It's a safe bet he's headed
To the border and beyond.
Well the moral of this tale
Is you can't change a leopard's spots
Don't blame a man for failing to be
Something that he's not
So girl, with that in mind
Won't you step into the light
We'll move just left of center
Till we finally get it right
Remember I'm a push it to the limit
Kind of guy
You may ask me how we'll do it
But no need to ask me why
I like to dance out to the edge
I like to cut to the chase
You see, I've never been one for reinin' back
To a slow and steady pace
If you ask me where we're bound
Well, honey, I just can't respond
But from the look in your eyes
It's a safe bet we're headed
To the border and beyond."

This piece was written by seeing the journey
of the wise men. The opening note on the piano
is the Star of Bethlehem. The shimmering is our
trip down from the Star to the sands that are lit
by the midnight sky. The first melody of music
is the first camel as it slowly passes by. When
the melody begins to harmonize with itself, we
see the secong camel pass. The third and final
camel begins the majority of the piece. In the
faces of the wise men we see weariness driven
by faith. The gifts they are bearing are ones of
request and honor. The music slows to reveal,
over the last hill of sand, the little town of
Bethlehem , the end of their journey and the
beginning of hope."
"I learned how to write it
When I first started school
Some bully didn't like it,
He said it didn't sound too cool
So I had to hit him
And all I said when the blood came
It's my last name
Grandpa took it off to Europe
To fight the Germans in the war
It came back on some dog tags
Nobody wears no more
It's written on a headstone
In the field where he was slain
It's my last name
Passed down from generations
Too far back to trace
I can see all my relations
When I look into my face
May never make it famous
But I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name
Daddy always told me far back as I recall
Son, you're part of somethin',
You represent us all
So keep it how you got it, as solid as it came
It's my last name
Passed down from generations
Too far back to trace
I can see all my relations
When I look into my face
May never make it famous
But I'll never bring it shame
It's my last name
So darlin' if you're wonderin'
Why I've got you here tonight
I want to be your husband, I want you to be my wife
I ain't got much to give you
But what I've got means everything
It's my last name
Oh, it's my last name
I learned how to write it
When I first started school"
"Here we all are at the end of ""the century of beauty lost"".
We greedily ate what you gave us, the rest we tossed.
We've trapped all your rivers, paved every pass,
Pulled at your sky till we caused it to rip.
But you've got Jimi Hendrix so lets call it an even split.
I've met a girl who has turned my whole world upside down.
The stars i once stretched for, now litter the ground.
I am cursed by too little, or is it too much belief,
In the strength of another man's words.
But I've got a girl, thank you lord.
Here we all are at the start of another thousand years.
All those love stories, yet to be told.
Ours is this river asleep at our feet,
Blessed by this wet autumn day.
Here we all are"
"I'm good at leaving
It's all I do
I'll hang around a day or two
And like the wild wind, I'll be gone
I've always been a rolling stone
I'm good at walkin' out the door
And I don't love you anymore
You're a fool for not believing
I'm good at leaving
I've tried and I've tried
To keep 'em all satisfied
I've prayed and I've stayed too long
If something comes over me
I got a knack for being free
I'm just following a feeling
I'm good at leaving
A couple times I said I do
A couple times I said we're through
I never really seem to get what I was needing
I'm good at packing up my car
I'm good at honky tonks and bars
I'm bad at staying home and cleaning
I'm good at leaving
I've tried and I've tried
To keep 'em all satisfied
I've prayed and I've stayed too long
If something comes over me
I got a knack for being free
I'm just following a feeling
I'm good at leaving"
"Written by dave bartholemew and pearl king.
One night with you
Is what I'm now prayin'for
All the things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I need your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide
(chorus)
Always lived a very quiet life
And I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
(repeat chorus)"
"Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
'Cause no matter how far away your roam
If you long for the sunshine and a friendly gaze
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home
I met a man who lived in Tennessee
And he was looking for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
Now in Pennsylvania folks are traveling
Down to Dixie's sunny shore
The Atlantic to Pacific
Oh, the season is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
For the holidays you can't beat home sweet home"
"Hold tight with a leather fist
Watch out when he starts to twist
That's what their daddies' used to tell them boys
How to ride them bulls
I got a jingle in my jeans
Sore places in between
And I'm leavin' on a saw blade
With a push and a pull
10-4 buddy, come on back
A horse trailer on a Cadillac
Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy
In the coupe de ville
Chug-a-luggin' up one side
Slidin' down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
Turn up that radio
Don't wanna think about a rodeo
Don't wanna think about a round-up
Up in old cheyenne
It's a crazy circuit
But still you work it
Turn down that sound, boys
Let's get up and check the scan
10-4 buddy, come on back
A horse trailer on a Cadillac
Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy
In the coupe de ville
Chug-a-luggin' up one side
Slidin' down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
Bandana hangin' mirror
Still wet from ear to ear
We'll, I guess it's true then
What the wise men say
When you ride your last one
Make sure he's the best one
Jump while he's movin'
Tip your hat boys and walk away
I'm a lover of the other
Side of the hill
I'm a lover of the other
Side of the hill"
"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razer
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
That you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"
"Nothing's prettier than Rose is she's the sunshine of my day
Nothing's prettier than Rose is she's my everything to say
Rose has always been a plain me they say beauty once was her desire
Rose to me has so much altere one look in her eyes sets me on fire
Nothing's prettier than Rose is...
[ ac.guitar ]
Rose will always be my special one she got much more than I deserve
Rose will always be my morning sun she mends my strenght and gives me nerve
Nothing's prettier than Rose is..."
"If all of my life I try and I try
Baby I could never show you
All this love I have inside
'Cause every day when we wake
I look deep into your eyes, I realize
[Chorus]
I could kiss you in the rain forever
Turn all of your pain to pleasure
Fill up all your days with sunlight
Make the passion last every night
Give you my every possession
Make you my only obsession
Climb up to the sky
And pull down all the stars above
But I could never love you enough
If I could have one wish it would just be this
That I could take you to my soul
And show you all the love there is
This never ending sea deep inside of me
There's no stopping it baby, even if
[Chorus]
No matter what I do
It's never as much as I want to
Baby it could never be enough
[Chorus]"
"The first time I met her
She walked right up to me and said you're who I've wanted to find.
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here
And I've passed this so many times.
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in her eyes
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.
She still calls it her lucky night,
Yes someone was lucky she's right
But it was me.
It was me
It was me"
"A house not a home was a picture satin painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside a house of God
For Satin held his hand down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying dear God make it right
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night"
"There was a bad boy in the school yard
Waited on you every day
Seemed like every time you turned around
Well he was standin' in your way
Well he broke your glasses
The girls all laughed
As he pushed you to the floor
But then you stood up one day knowin'
You couldn't stand it anymore
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage
You were face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
Your date showed up with flowers
And you thought your dreams had come
But with every passing hour
You felt it come undone
Then the night exploded and you begged him no
But he forever changed your life
And now he waits a judge and jury
Thinkin' you'll break down inside
And with a finger you can put his fists away
And you're face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well little sister wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Drivin' by the grave yard
On a wicked winter's eve
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith
Is whistlin' nervously
Then you stop the car
And you hold your heart
'Cause you finally realize
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness
He's a'rattlin' 'round inside
And with folded hands you truly start to pray
And you're face to face
Face to face with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face
'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Face to face"
"I saw a little beam of sunlight
Steal across a purple sky
And bent down to kiss a rose bud
Oh, it made me wanna cry
And to think that I've been permitted
To see a part of nature's plan
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Little children painting pictures
Of the blooms and apple trees
Oh, why can't the grown up people
Have faith of one thing?
And to think those tiny fingers
Might become a killer's hand
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man
Why can't we see the folly?
And the uselessness of pain
Love could lead to understanding
Maybe it's not too late
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man
Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man"
"Did you say that you've been searching for
A place you've never been?
Well here it is
Here it is
And you've been down there on the bottom
And looking out for a friend
Here I am
Here I am
[Chorus]
We've both grown tired
Of running after rainbows
Here we are
Darling, here we are
When it feels like you've been driftin'
And you don't know where you've been
Come on in
You can come on in
And if all you've seen are back doors
That lead you out of town
Turn around
You can turn around
[Chorus]
We've both grown tired
Of running from each other
Here we are
Darling, here we are
Here we are
Here we are"
"(It's a lovely lovely world since I met you)
Mother nature's opened up the door to lots of things I never saw before
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Never did see everything looking so nice I just learned the meaning of paradise
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Now the sun shines brighter and the sky is a little bit bluer
And my little old rattle trap Ford Coupe even seems a little bit newer
Well my guitar stays a better in tune
The stars snine brighter there's honey on the moon
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
[ ac.guitar ]
Ever since you cuddled in my embrace I've had more fate in the human race
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Now I don't mind working or slaving all day I know tonight there'll be love to pay
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Everything seems real so right since the day I found you
Everything looks rosy and shiny bright in the dreams I'm building around you
Used to think that miracles would never come true
But now I'm happy cause I know they do
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you"
"I've got this sensitive condition
It's aggrivated by, bars and neon lights
And bedroom eyes all painted up
Fast ladies and slow songs
I feel a cheatin' heart attack, comin' on
I feel, a cheatin' heart attack, comin' on
I think it's best I get myself on home
'cause if I stay for one more drink
I won't leave here alone
I feel a, cheatin' heart attack comin' on
I had a real close call with a sweet young thing
She hit me hard took me right off guard
Handed me a drink
I heard the golden band on my hand
Ring against the glass and that
Cheatin' heart attack was gone at last
I felt, a cheatin' heart attack comin' on
And I think it's best I get myself on home
'cause if I stay for one more drink
I won't leave hear alone
I can feel a, cheatin' heart attack comin' on"
"I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main roads
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows that stretch down South
Will never take the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line"
"Wish I could stop these tears I wish I didn't care wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could be set free from all your memories wish I didn't love you anymore
But if wishing really made it so I'd have the different wish I know
I'd wish you still love me just like you did before
But that wish can't come true so all that I can do is wish I didn't love you anymore
Wish I could just forget that we had ever met wish I didn't love you anymore
How I wish I didn't love you anymore"
"Hands across the table while the lines are low
Go you hush your lips your fingertips tell me all I want to know
Hands across the table meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way that you belong to me
Hush your lips your fingertips
Yes you belong to me"
"Everybody's heart is torn and tattered
Mine was not designed for giving up
'Cause all I've ever done that really matters
Is what I did for love
So count me with the wounded and the shaken
Even when I'm barely standing up
I've tried to offer more than I have taken
That's what I did for love
What I did for love
I gave everything
And I hope that you can see
All that love has given me
When they sit and list the reasons I existed
I'm afraid it won't add up to very much
'Cause I gathered all I had and gladly risked it
That's what I did for love
Yeah
What I did for love
I gave everything
And I hope that you can see
All that love has given me
Someday I may silently surrender
When this old heart has finally had enough
But I hope that I will always be remembered
By what I did for love
See all I've ever done that really matters
Is what I did for love"
"That old wind that's whipping out there
It's whistlin' your tune
That wind blew pyramids to Egypt
And footprints to the moon
And that old star that you been wishin' on
Is shinin' mighty bright
But it's the fire inside your heart
That's gonna lead you to the light
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold her
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance
You know failure isn't failure
If a lesson from it's learned
I guess love would not be love
Without a risk of being burned
Anything in life worth havin'
Lord, it has its sacrifice
But the gift that you're receiving
Is worth more than a price
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to live there
How you ever gonna know
What you never knew
How you ever gonna know
If you're down here doin'
What the good Lord put you here to do
How you ever gonna know
If you could have done it
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to fly
How you ever gonna know
If you never dare to try
Listen not to the critics
Who put their own dreams on the shelf
If you want to get the truth to admit it
You gotta find out for yourself
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to be there
How you ever gonna know
If you're the best
How you ever gonna know
What you believe in
If you don't put it to the test
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold him
How you ever gonna know
What livin' means
How you ever gonna know
If you never chase the dreams
How you ever gonna know
Your potential
How you ever gonna know victory
How you ever gonna know
What it's like when dreams become reality
How you ever gonna know
How it feels to hold her
How you ever gonna know
What it's like to dance
How you ever gonna know
If you never take a chance"
"Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
It's about a love that's got me blue
A love forsaken for somebody new
He roles through town just like you do
He's just like the river that's only passing through
So roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
I've grown so tired of all those lies
I'm on my way now to find some bluer skies
Gonna find me a ticket far from this town
Far from the river that only brings me down
I've got a broken heart, it's about to mend
Like it always has, time and time again
Gonna send these troubles on down the line
I'm gonna let them spill and flow away like wine
Roll on muddy river, roll to the sea
Take all these memories from me
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground
Take all of the rain that's falling down
Take all of these teardrops splashing on the ground"
"I've lived a lot in my time
I once had a mansion and lived in my glory but now I'm down to my last dime
I once had a sweetheart but I was unfaithful yes I've lived a lot in my time
I fought the Grim Reaper down in the dark valley
I prayed when the sun wouldn't shine
I've looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison oh I've lived a lot in my time
I've been a soldier and I've been a rambler I once thought that everything was fine
I've hoed in the cornfield I've picked in the cotton yes I've lived a lot in my time
I've walked with our Master down in the dark valley and wonderful peace I did find
But now some day I'll journey to Eden's green pastures
Oh I've lived a lot in my time I've lived a lot in my time"
"Oh man, you've gotta watch where you're stepping around here
Yeah I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Connway Twitty
Don't know nothing about grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, yee haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them jeans
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Nah, you ain't gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06,
Or have a Bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Well yeah Bubba all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you gotta let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on you ain't alone, you ain't alone
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, yee haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them jeans
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, yee haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens

All for the love we need

Reach till you know how far
Trust till you know how true
Give till you know how much

Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed
All for the love we want

For this we shed our skin
Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed

Well I've seen miles and miles of beautiful country
Friends I hate to leave
But those northern reaches beckon me
Even as we speak
So it's goodbye Colorado, goodbye Arizon'
Goodbye Nevada, goodbye New Mexico
God bless the west and Texas yes you know I'll miss you so
But it's goodbye Colorado, boys I'm headed home
Well I won't be comin' round much more
I bid you all farewell
Perhaps we may meet up again
On further down the trail
Well it occurs to me before I go
I've one more stop to make
I have some time and after all
How long could one kiss take?
Goodbye Colorado, goodbye Arizon'
Goodbye Nevada, goodbye New Mexico
God bless the west and Texas yes you know I'll miss you so
But it's goodbye Colorado, boys I'm headed home"
"Well I'm back again for another night
Of trying to break free from the sadness
That I can't lay to rest
This old honky tonk sure does feel like home
And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From her memories driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me to forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Now if a tear should fall if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin'
while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owen's song
I know she won't mind she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own
Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From her memories driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me to forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose"

*There comes a time when inquiring minds must know
Just why we have come together as one
There are rumors flying
Even LaToya's psychic line
Could not predict that you would marry me
**Take it Lisa Marie
+You couldn't go on pretending day by day
That you were really the King
You're more feminine than me
From plastic surgery
And Liz was old and overweight so you chose me
We own the world we got gazillions
*You wear the pants I'll wear the glove and LOVE the children
+I'll teach you scientology
Move to Memphis Tennessee
*I swear we're gonna have more clout than Bill and Hillary
*Oh Priscilla was mad
She said your dad
Was weird enough
+But even Elvis didn't try to buy the elephant man
*He gave away big Cadillacks
Ate cheeseburgers by the stacks
+And left me a bloody fortune no you get half
We own the world that's why we're grinning
And if you hear a whirling sound it's Elvis spinning
+Ah he's turning over in his grave
His face has turned blue suede
*And if he ain't really dead this'll kill him now
+We haven't kissed so far we've just held hands
The only ride you've given me was at Disneyland
*Waa waa wellllllllll there's people suing
Oh they're trying to make me pay
I've had to hire more lawyers than OJ
We own the world
Neverland and Graceland
Bubbles the Chimp can have the jungle room to play in
+I'll learn to do the moonwalk too
*And if my nose should come unglues
Or my hair should catch on fire you'll come to my rescue
We own the world
+He loves me tender
Even though I'm still not sure about his gender
*I guess that I'm a cross between Janet and Jermaine
+And I'm a hunka hunka burnin' love straight from the King

"It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart, she is gone
Road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
As on the day that I first met her
That I told her of my love
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart, she is gone
Road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
For I know I'll meet her there
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart, she is gone
Road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
She's the only love I've known
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart, she is gone
Road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart, she is gone
Road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on"
"I was takin' a walk through a small country city
Just seem' what there was to see
I sat down to read a historical marker
When I felt someone sit down by me
He leaned on the tank that was helping his breathing
Said it's bad when your body is gone
I said this is sure a nice town that you've got here
He said yeah, but there's no place like home
I wish I could see Bakersfield
Where the oil wells are pumpin'
The oranges are bloomin'
And the grapevine winds down from the hill
When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies
At the corner where I used to live
Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield
He said you don't ever know where life's gonna lead you
When you go ramblin' off down the track
Sometimes I wish I'd never left California
Then I couldn't want to go back
Recitation:
He said ""You know, I used to be a well-known country singer
Made my first record back in 1953
At one time Buck Owens was my lead guitar player
And ol' Hag once wrote a song about me""
I wish I could see Bakersfield
Where the oil wells are pumpin'
The oranges are bloomin'
And the grapevine winds down from the hill
When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies
At the corner where I used to live
Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield
Oh I wish I could see Bakersfield"
"I'd wish you'd scream
Just say anything
Curse my name, slam the door
There's a stranger where you stood before
And he looks at me
Like I'm not there
I'm floating here in the atmosphere
And you don't care
Knock knock
Lights come on but nobody's home
I talk
But you've turned off some time ago
So we spin like a broken record and your unavailability
Is killing me
No vacancy
Everytime I knock knock
So roll away
That heart of stone
It's turned you cold
You're hard to hold
When you're up in your head
It's about to get
Like we never met
We walk around this ghost town
Just like the living dead
Can you hear me
Can you hear me now
Can you hear me
Beating on the door of your heart
The door of your heart"
"There's a place not too far away from here
Out with the cows and the Lone Star beer
Where the livin' and lovin' is quite all right with me
Well they call it Texas and it's a mighty fine place to be
Runs from Texarkana to El Paso
And Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antone
People in Texas sure do make you feel at home
They just want everybody to leave them alone
While they drink their whiskey and roll their own
And they like their music with a little bit of southern sound
They kick up their heels every evening when the sun goes down
And you can call them country and they don't care
And if you don't like the way they wear their hair
You can take you like and shove 'em on up the line
People in Texas don't care if the sun don't shine"
"I've been humbled by the Glory, and the power of his love
When I've stumbled and I've fallen, he's been there to pick me up
In the face of all temptation, been the strength to stand my ground
Wrapped in His sweet salvation, I know I'm Glory-bound
I'm a man, I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
I've cried tears of jealous sorrow, I have tasted bitter wine
Lost faith in my tomorrow, and I've cursed the hands of time
I wandered through the darkness, surrendered to my doubts
I've been so close to Hell, I've could hear the devil shout
I'm a man, I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time, oh yeah
When all the clouds have parted, and I lie face to face with death
I won't fear the darkness, in the grasp of my last breath
I climb that mighty stairway, that leads to Heaven's gate
The surrender of my soul, will be my final leap of faith
I'm a man, I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
Oh, I'm a man, I'm not an angel
Oh, I've got no wings to fly
But I'll make it up to Heaven
One step at a time
One step at a time
I said, one step at a time"
"An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold"
"When I was a lad an old cowboy told me well son you're sure ridin' well
There's fame and there's fortune
And glory waitin' at the end of the rodeo trail
So I packed up my stuff in my old pickup truck to follow my rodeo dreams
Now I'm finally on the top but I feel like a flop
Cause I've spent all the fortune I've seen
Now where is the glory in drivin' all night
Down a highway that's headed to nowhere
What good's the fame when the fortune's all gone
And the dreams turned into a nightmare
Like Ed Bruce said Mamma's don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
I'm inclined to agree but if you ask me you know I'd go through it again
Now what does it take to be a rodeo cowboy I guess I'm a expert at that
Takes a whole lot of guts and old lady luck but not too much under this hat
Well he thrives on the crowds yellin' real load for him to face dyin' again
But the good Lord takes care of children and fools
He's no kid so what's that make him
Now where is the glory..."
"Yeah, I blame it all on my roots.
I showed up in boots
Ruinin' your black tie affair...
Last one to know, last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there.
And I saw the surprise
That fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne.
I toasted you said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain.
No, cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
The beer chases my blues away
Yeah I'll be okay baby (that's right BK)
Yeah cause I'm not big on social graces
Big I slip on down to the oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(That's right boys, let's go)
I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
Hey but damn, I've been there before.
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door.
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then.
I'll be as high as that Ivory Tower
That you're livin' in
Yeah, cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away.
Yeah we'll be okay baby
Yeah, cause I'm not big on social graces
Big, I slip on down to the oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(Let's break it down)
Yeah, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But damn, I've been there before.
Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door.
No, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait tiI' I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady, I'll be back to the bar
(Come on B)
You can kiss my ass!
Cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns,
The beer chases my blues away
I'll be okay (that's right)
Yeah cause I'm not big on social graces
Big I slip on down to oasis
So I got friends in low places.
(Ya'll know where to chill)
We got friends
(Uh-oh)
In low places, yeah
Go on and ring it out one time"
"Tonight again you'll be holding another tenderly
Whispering soft sweet words you once spoke to me
While I'm here a lonely living old memories
Of the precious love you once gave to me
Then softly and tenderly tears touch my cheeks
Invisible tears no one ever sees
Softly and tenderly my heart still beats
For only you and all the love you gave to me
[ piano ]
It seems to me that you're reaching for a world that don't exist
Searching for new lips that you've never kissed
When I think I find your conscience has suddenly gone blind
I find I wonder who if you were ever really mine
Then softly and tenderly...
For only you and all the love you gave to me"
"Home Remedy
Its a home remedy when you put your arms around me
I know the working day is through
Youre the right recipe never failing to astound me
Time proven tried and true
Passion flowers, love in bloom
Solar power lighting up the room
Youre a soulful feeling, and my natural high
A touch of healing in the night, feels so right
You brought your laughter, I gave my trust
You showed me patience and a healthy dose of lust
Cant advertise it, cant box it up
But I have tried it and Ill never get enough of the
Things we say without a sound
The way you turn my world around"
"Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I ever seen.
Folks down there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene.
I sit alone most every night
Watch them trains roll out of sight
Wish that they were carryin' me
To Abilene, my Abilene.
Crowded city, ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to God that I could be
In Abilene, my Abilene.
How I wish that train would come
Take me back where I come from.
Take me where I want to be
In Abilene, my Abilene.
Rotgut whiskey numbs the brain
If I stay here I'll go insane.
Think I need a change of scene
To Abilene, my Abilene.
Outside my window cold rain falls,
Sit here starin' at the walls;
If I was home, I'd be serene
In Abilene, my Abilene."
"I apologize
I should've kept it hidden
Under wraps and out of sight
At least in the beginning
But I wanted you to see
What you meant to me
Turns out that wasn't smart
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Wish I could take back
the secret that I told you
But it's too late for that
Now you know the whole truth
Three stupid little words
You never should have heard
But I let down my guard
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Take one last look before it's gone
It's time I put it back where it belongs
Next time I will know
Not to let my feelings show
I'll keep them in the dark
A sleeve is no place for a heart"
"Oh, I wish I had someone to love me,
Someone to call me their own.
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with,
'Cause I'm tired of living alone.
Oh, meet me tonight in the moonlight,
Please meet me tonight all alone.
For I have a sad story to tell you,
It's a story that's never been told.
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow,
Leaving my poor darling alone.
With the cold prison bars all around me,
And my head on a pillow of stone.
Now I have a grand ship on the ocean,
All mounted with silver and gold.
And before my poor darling would suffer,
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold."
"Well, the rumor is that you've been seen
Running like and old greyhound
Acting like you're over me
Out there painting the town
And it seems, no matter where I go
Your bark can't be ignored
You show up with a brand new pup
Waggin' your tail out on the floor
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds
Hot doggin all over town
Well, it's clear to see, you got a bone to pick
Ever since I threw you out
And I've heard you've learnt a few new tricks
Living in the old doghouse
Well, you stay out late an' you tell your friends
That you ran away from home
You say you broke your leash
Now you're out of the streets
Like an' old stray that's ready to roam
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds
Hot doggin all over town
Well, it seems, no matter where I go
Your bark can't be ignored
You show up with a brand new pup
Wagging your tail like you're over us
Out on the floor, strutting your stuff
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds
Hot doggin all over town
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Just a-hot doggin (hot doggin)
Showing off, making the rounds
Hot doggin all over town
Hot dog, hee, hee, hee"
"You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
Longs to hold you tight
Oh I am just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me
I never knew the art of making love
No my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you will never know
The one who loves you so
Well you don't know me"
"Drink up baby
Stay up all night
The things you could do
You won't but you might
The potential you'll be
That you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now
And forget all about the pressure of days
Do what I say and I'll make you okay
And drive them away
The images stuck in your head
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
They push, shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
Drink up baby
Look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there
With your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time
And I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest
Where I like you the best
And keeping the things you forgot
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
"
"Last night I come home and I knocked on my door
I called to my love as I oft had before
I knocked and I knocked but no answer it came
No kisses to greet me no voice called my name
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord I couldn't believe it was true
My eyes filled with tears I must have aged ten years
I couldn't believe it was true
I let myself in and I walk to our bed
I found a note there and the message it read
The truth like a bolt from the blue in the dawn
My sweetheart had left me my darling had gone
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord
The shock was so great I am quivering yet
I tried to forgive but I cannot forget
My heartbreaking loss is another man's gain
Her happiness always I hope will remain
I couldn't believe it was true oh Lord"
"So long we've been married last burden we've carried
Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we'd make up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
Oh I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone
When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all with my heart
We may have to leave here
They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here"
"You were a pain girl, a thorn in my side
Drove me insane girl, a white-knuckle ride
So why do I go lookin' through old photographs
And chase you down the hallways of our checkered past
Hold on for dear life and keep the fire fed
I oughta let go but instead
It's like I'm pressing on a bruise
To see if it still hurts
Right now that's all I've got left of you
Everybody knows that just makes it worse
But still I do
I could start a new life, I could move on
I could do a drive by, and see if you're home
Now there's a fine, fine line between a memory
And something any shrink would call an injury
But it's not over long as you're still hurtin' me
And as I turn onto your street
It's like I'm pressing on a bruise
To see if it still hurts
Right now that's all I've got left of you
Anybody knows that just makes it worse
But still I do
Still I do, still I do, still love you
But she's the kind of girl puts your world on hold
Walk the halls and you check your phone
Gave up the ghost and the ghost keeps holdin' on
And you run from the sun but you curse the rain
Lost the love so you nurse the pain
Goin' on and on, singin' that same song
But she's gone
(I can't let it alone)
And you get drunk on those glory days
(I can't just let it heal)
With a broken heart and a bitter taste
(No, I can't just let it go)
Well, you light it up as she burns you down
(I can't just let it heal)
You're smokin' those memories to the ground
(Like I'm pressing on a bruise)
Yeah, that's the thing about love and pain
They may look alike but they're not the same
(No, I can't just let it go)
You've got to let it go go go
(No, I can't just let it heal)"
"He was sittin' at the bar, sippin' on a regular Coke
We were drinkin' and smokin' and makin' him the butt of our jokes
We all said, ""Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?""
He said, ""I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't.""
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot
Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start lookin' hot
And pretty soon I'm bummin' cigarettes, and sweet talkin' some big brunette
Yeah, once I get on a roll, ain't no tellin' where I'll stop
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancin' machine
I get loud, I get proud, and it gets worse
Well, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Naw, there ain't no in-between
'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yep, yep
Hmm, that's what I'm talking about
Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink"
"Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me
See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me
Come home come home ya who are weary come home
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home
Oh for the wonderful love he has promised promised for you and for me
Though we have sinn'd he has mercy and pardon pardon for you and for me
Come home come home"
"Woke up to a beautiful sun
Shining brightly in the east
Want to have it shine on everyone
The way it's shining on me
We got such a long way to go
And we got so much to do
But I made a promise to myself
I'd be right here for you
I feel the cool of the wind
Touching me like a long lost friend
When I hear the music play and I hear the children sing
I know together anything is possible
Time won't slip away, we'll get through all that life can bring
And I know together anything is possible
What do you want from life?
What do you want to be?
You looked me straight in the eye
And you say, ""Happy""
I have to sit down for a while
'Cause it made my heart sink
Realizing for the first time
We wanted the same thing
I hear the cry of the wind
Calling me to this place again
When I hear the music play and I hear the children sing
I know together anything is possible
Time won't slip away, we'll get through all that life can bring
And I know together anything is possible
When I hear the music play and I hear those children sing
I know together anything is possible
We won't let time won't slip away
We'll get through all that life can bring
And I know together anything is possible
Together
(Anything)
Right now I know
(Anything)
I know that
(Anything is possible)
Come on, I know now
(Anything)
Anything is possible
(Anything)
Together anything
(Anything is possible, yeah)"
"Treat me like a fool treat me mean and cruel but love me
Bring my faithful heart tear it all apart but love me
If you'll ever go darling I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue crying over you dear only
I would beg and steal just to feel
Your heart beating close to mine
Every night I pray to the stars that shine above me
Beggin' on my knees all I ask is please, please love me"
"When the princess and the peasants each look back at you the same
When the friend that you had known before can't quite recall your name
When each morning there's a cloudy sky to keep the sun from showing
Then you know you are your own sometimes that's all that keeps ya going
Neath the chimneys and the rooftops of a village safe and sound
No one sees the face nor hears the feet that walk the morning ground
And the stillness of the alleys and the highways keep a growing
So you know you are your own and that alone will keep ya going
Through the dampness of the dawn now by the road you walk alone
And you think on days when you had laughed or of a lovve you'd known
But your head is low avoiding thoughts of times you'll soon be knowing
When to say you are your own ain't quite enough to keep ya going"
"In the unemployment line in the unemployment line
I see a butcher and a baker a faker and a quaker and an old girl friend of mine
There's white collars blue collars and no collars too talking bout the bad new times
And we all get together every Wednesday afternoon in the unemployment line
Now who do you think was there today talking bout food and rent
There was a hard hat a fat cat a girl from the laundromat and one ex-president
I raised my eyes and prayed to the Lord please save this world of mine
Then I turned around and I saw God standin' in the unemployment line
In the unemployment line in the unemployment line
Hey I'll see all of you in a week or two in the unemployment line"
"Ooh
Ooh
Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and my Bob Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for naught on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare
But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)
Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air
She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hand trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)
Well, I do not deny I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear
But there's nobody, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair), yeah yeah yeah
Hey, yeah
Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We were live or die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha
But the foreman of the jury told me honey, don't you worry
It's a Choctaw county affair, yeah
(Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair), yeah
How would you know 'cause you weren't there (Choctaw County affair)
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Mmm, yeah, yeah (Choctaw County affair)"
"On a sleepy endless ocean when the world lay in a dream
There was rhythm in the splash and roll, but not a voice to sing
So the moon shone on the breakers and the morning warmed the waves
Till a single cell did jump and hum for joy as though to say
This is my home, this is my only home
This is the only sacred ground that i have ever known
And should i stray in th dark night alone
Rock me goddess in the gentle arms of eden
Then the day shone bright and rounder til the one turned into two
And the two into ten thousand things, and old things into new
And on some virgin beach head one lonesome critter crawled
And he looked about and shouted out in his most astonished drawl
This is my home ...
Then all the sky was buzzin and the ground was carpet green
And the wary children of the wood went dancin in between
And the people sang rejoicing when the field was glad with grain
This song of celebration from their cities on the plain
This is my home ...
Now there's smoke across the harbor, and there's factories on the shore
And the world is ill with greed and will and enterprise of war
But i will lay my burden in the cradle of your grace
And the shining beaches of your love and the sea of your embrace
This is my home ..."
"From a Jack to a King.
From loneliness to a wedding ring.
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,
An' walked away with your heart.
From a Jack to a King.
With no regrets, I stacked the cards last night.
And Lady Luck played her hand just right:
You made me King of your heart.
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.
From a Jack to a King.
From loneliness to a wedding ring.
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,
You made me King of your heart.
For just a little while, I thought that I might lose again.
Then just in time, I saw the twinkle in your eye.
From a Jack to a King.
From loneliness to a wedding ring.
I played a Ace and I won a Queen,
You made me King of your heart."
"Now the fate takes us both to the crossroads it seems that we two have to part
No matter what happenes my darling you'll always be close to my heart
If troubles and cares overtake you whatever your sorrows may be
No matter what happens my darling I want you to please call on me
[ steel ]
I'll always be ready to guide you if destiny leads you astray
No matter what happens my darling my heart's with you each night and day
So remember that you're always with me in mem'ry you'll be by my side
No matter what happens my darling you'll still be my true love and bride"
"Since you told me yesterday there were things you had to say
I've been waiting for my last chance with you
Something big is on your mind like a spring you must unwind
So I'm waiting for my last chance with you
I'm preparing for tomorrow when you'll break the news to me
I dare not show my sorrow it's not a shoulder that I need
I've a need for you to love me and I tear somebody new
So I'm waiting for my last chance with you
[ steel ]
I've rehearsed the scene all over pretending you were here
I've been practicing the presence of you
I've been wondering how you'd tell me and planning what I'd do
While thinking bout my last chance with you
If I don't win you tomorrow something tells me someone will
Wish I knew where I could borrow some love making skill
I've a need for you to love me and I tear somebody new
So I'm waiting for my last chance with you"
"It ain't nothin' but a concrete jungle with people packed like sardines
Where everybody's tryin' to live beyond their means
Where all the natives hurry and scurry too and fro
And like a fleas on a puppy dog they got no place to go
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Talk about a bummer it's the biggest one around
Sodom and Gommorah was tame to what I found
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang town
Well I ain't seen the sunshine since the day that I arrived
Cause brother I've been busy a tryin' to survive
Nobody knows you've been here till you're six feet under ground
Than you become a statistic if they remember to write you down"
"You got me I got you we got love
When we walk in the room they stop talking
But the looks that we get say a lot
Let them think what they're like you and I both know we're right
They'd give the world if they had what we got
We got love and that's all that matters and it gets a little stronger day by day
There's a ring on your hand you're my girl and I'm your man
You got me I got you we got love
They're just jealous because they know we're happy
And I guess that it does show on my face
So let's smile and say hello to everyone we know
We got something that nothing can replace
We got love and that's all that matters,
There's a ring on your hand,
There's a ring on your hand"
"Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
Bought a motorcycle in his younger days
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew
Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue
A barefoot bearded swamp rat
But a man above all others
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised"
"Oh I must have had rocks in my head well I believed anything that you said
Like a puppy I rolled over and played dead oh I must have had rocks in my head
Many nights I've waited up till twelve o'clock
That's all over now my waitin's gonna stop
I get dressed up and I'll go out on the town
While I'll live it up and you can live it down
Oh I must have had rocks...
[ steel ]
Well I'm tired of talkin' to the walls tired of waitin' all alone for you to call
So when you see me dancing with a brand new girl
Then you'll know that I've got a brand new whirl
Oh I must have had rocks...
Yes I must have had rocks in my head"
"Cadillac smiles in the ladies' styles in this world
They ain't no part of me
A hundred dollar bill can cure your ills in this world
But it ain't no good to me
You see money and clothes are easily burned
People and cars are easily turned around
I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound
I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine
A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be
You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground
I'd give every material thing I own in this life
If I could just hear the sound
I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine
I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine
I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat"
"Well did you ever sleep at the foot of the bed when the weather was whizzin' cold
When the wind was a howlin' round the house and the moon was yeller as gold
And you give your good warm mattress up to Aunt Lizzie and Uncle Fred
How too many kinfolks on a bad night and you went to the foot of the bed
Well I could always wait till the old folks ate and eat the leavin's with grace
The teacher could keep me after school I'd still have a smile on my face
I could wear the big girls' wornout clothes or let sister have my sled
But it always did get my nanny goat to sleep at the foot of the bed
[ ac.guitar ]
It was fine enough when kinfolks come and the kid brought brand new games
You could see how fat all the old folks was and learn all the babies' names
Had biscuits and custard and chicken pie we all got Sunday fed
But I always knew when nighttime come I was headed for the foot of the bed
Now they say some folks don't know what it is havin' company all over the place
To rassle for cover on a winter night with a big foot settin' in your face
Or cold toenails a scratchin' your back and the footboard scrubbin' your head
Well I'll tell the world you ain't lost a thing never sleepin' at the foot of the bed
Well I've done it over and over again in this land of the brave and the free
And in this all fired battle of life it's left its mark on me
For I'm always a strugglin' around at the foot instead of forgin' ahead
And I don't think it's caused from a doggone thing
But a sleepin' at the foot of the bed"
"i dont wanna go to chattanooga
i wanna stay here with you
i dont wanna go to chattanooga
the judge says its what i gotta do
ooh who laying here with you
will you wait 4 weeks for me
will you wait 4 weeks for me
the moon is shining on the water
and the water is all over you
love me one last time in the water
to manchester i will walk with you
ooh who going home with you
will you wait 4 weeks for me
will you wait 4 weeks for me"
"I had dreams that were bigger than the Montana sky
And we were gonna do great in Great Falls
I just knew we were this time
But when winter finally broke, so were we
You'll never know how bad that hurt
'Cause this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
I lost the farm in Kansas
Along with a lot of pride
Then I almost lost my life
Down in that West Virginia mine
And that motel room in Memphis
Was a long way from diamonds and pearls
And that sure ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
[Chorus]
I swear your love is stronger
Than any dream of mine I've ever drug you through
And I swear I wasn't lyin'
They just never did come true
You've always bet on this old gambler
Every time I gave the wheel a whirl
But this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
Now this Shreveport sun is settin'
On another broken dream of mine
And I guess that mansion on the hill
Is pretty hard to see tonight
But as long as there's a breath of life in me
I'm gonna get it for you, girl
'Cause this ain't what I meant
When I promised you the world
[Chorus]"
"Mmm mmm mmm mmm mMm mmm mmm
mMm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
If I had know your heart was down,
The lonely day, in Greenville town,
Then I would have been more concerned,
But later on I truely learned,
How it can feel in every bone,
To really see that you're all alone,
But I'll, I'll kiss you head,
When death finds your bed,
And you are gone,
If I had seen the way it would be,
I'd hushed your cries when you came to me,
If I could do,
What I did to you,
The same to me,
Then I would love for you to see,
That sleep with remorse,
And regret hangs round my door forever more,
If I had known the lowering tide,
Was lowering with the way you felt inside,
If I had known all hope was gone,
A broken heart and a broken home,
That pierced my lovers past,
And carved a lonely path for her to walk,
So if ever someone says to you ""Life isn't fair, get used to it"",
The you should say ""Well it might, If folks like you would let it be""
But I'll, I'll kiss your head,
When death becomes my bed and I am gone....."
"Hold me kiss me whisper to me our love will go on forever
Want me need me tell me sweetly our love will go on forever
Forever and ever my heart will be true forever and ever I'll love only you
Hold me kiss me whisper to me our love will go on forever"
"Dear sweetheart as I write to you my heart is filled with pain
For if those things I hear are true I'll never see you again
They tell me darlin' that tonight you'll wed another man
But if you do I'll tell you true my boat will never land
You promised that you would wait for me that nothin' could come between
That in my arms someday you'd be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands sweet flowers rich and fair
My future hopes are placed in you you've been my guidin' star
Please write and tell me that you're true to the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I'll return and then we'll wed and live a happy life"
"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the green old flowing mountains to the south down along the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome, she's known quite well by all
The regular combination on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Well, the eastern states are dandy, most people always say
From New York to St. Louis and old Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall
No changes need be taken on that Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
In the hills of Tennessee many places throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains 'round him fall
[Incomprehensible] him back to Dixie on that Wabash Cannonball
We came down to Nashville on a warm November day
As we rolled into that station I heard somebody say
There's a boy from Carolina, they're wide and fat and tall
They came down to pick us a few, they rode the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to that jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you ramble across the country on that Wabash Cannonball"

I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slappin' on paint
Don't have a knack for makin' motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
So hand me one more
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the nightlife
I love my Bud Light

"You're a thousand miles away from me tonight and Lord I miss you so
You could be in someone else's arms right now and I would never know
But I'll go lay me down to sleep and never let it cross my mind
Cause I love you and you love me and our love is that rare and special kind
We've got it all we've got it all there's nothing else I could need we've got it all
We're lovers and we're friends through good and bad thick and thin
I said it once and I'll say it again we've got it all
I watched the sun go down this afternoon and paint the city's face all red
Then I wished upon a silver star that crept into the pink sky overhead
And I told myself that someday I won't have to go and leave you all alone
Then I wrote your name upon a frosted window pane and then I wrote this song
We've got it all..."
"I've seen the way you handle other guys
I watched the water fall from their eyes
Your little world of love is so unfair
It'd be a nice place to visit but I'd sure hate to live there
The kisses that you give 'em must be nice
Cause they keep on a coming back to spite the price
Your love is probably something very rare
It'd be a nice place to visit but I'd sure hate to live there
It'd be so nice to taste those kisses you leave layin' round so loose
Bud I'd wake up in the morning with the king size case of the blues
Yeah my mama told me something the way back then
She said if you get burned boy don't go back again
Your beauty keeps on a waggin' me I swear
It'd be a nice place to visit but I'd sure hate to live there
It'd be a nice place to visit but I'd sure hate to live there"
"Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake
But I'm ten times crazier without about your lovin', girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
Well I'm all about a weekend, kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinkin' that I won't leave 'em hanging
'Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy bout a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you"
"Your baby blues
Looking at me tonight
In a brand new light
What a surprise
Was a time when I would have given anything
For you to look at me this way
But as your friend I've got to say
Maybe we should wait
When you say you're over her
I want to believe it
But we both know it's
[Chorus:]
Only the lonely talkin'
Wanting
Me to keep on holding you this way
Baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talkin'
It would be easy for me
To lie in your arms tonight
Oh but in the morning light
Would it be right
'Cause I want all of you
Not just a part of you
So tell me is it
[Chorus:]
Baby we've got time
To make this thing right
But right here, right now
Tonight...it's
[Chorus:]"
"Four men in a big truck came today
They walked right in and took your all things away
And standing at the door I've watched them drive away
Now it all comes back like it was yesterday
I had stopped off for a drink on my way home
Saw an old girl friend at a corner all alone
She said let's have a drink just for old time sake
I sat down with her and that was my mistake
Now where love used to live there's just an empty home
For when jealousy moved in everything went wrong
If you'd only trusted me and had a heart to forgive
There'd be love again where love used to live
But someday I'll be looking out the door
And that same big truck will pull up here once more
I'll watch the same four men as they unload love again
And put it back the way it was before
Then where love used to live there'll be a happy home
With fate and understanding nothing can go wrong
When you've finally realized there's nothing to forgive
There'll be love again where love used to live
There'll be love again where love used to live"
"left Oklahoma drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' on to Arizona, maybe on to California
Where all the people live so fine
My baby said I was crazy, my momma called me lazy
I was goin' to show 'em all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool an' I don't need no more schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well there I was in Hollywood wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies and nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just wastin' time
Well then I got to thinkin', man I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin' and nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know I've been through it
Livin' on Tulsa time"
"The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there
Set in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
Cause there was nothing there
That you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time
I have never been so far out in front
That I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time
Knowing this you found a thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before
And memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you seem me to be
I've set you free this time
I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to win or a thing to lose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
There was only something
You can look at lying in your hand
Now who's wondering what has changed
And why it can not be arranged
To have each thing work fine
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I'll set you free this time"
"How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
[Chorus]
How long,
How how long,
Baby how long?
Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
[Chorus]
I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
[Chorus]
I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
[Chorus]
You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
[Chorus]
Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.
[Chorus]
How long, baby how long
Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?"
"The words of a love song just like a love letter will send your heart's message along
So if you're not gifted to make pretty speeches just sing her a pretty love song
Sing her a love song that tells her you love her don't keep her waiting too long
If you can't say what's your heart wants to tell her just sing her a pretty love song
[ steel - guitar ]
Just call her your darling and tell her you love her a kiss or two wouldn't be wrong
If you can't say how you feel when you hold her just sing her a pretty love song
Sing her a love song..."

In my fathers arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free
It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away"

Did you buy me in a boystore mama where'd you find me
Well Bobby I found you in a smile
And the gentleness hidden in your daddy's eyes
Freddie said a bird came and left me in a tree
Mama where'd I come from that don't sound right to me
Well I'll tell you darling God in all his sweetness smiled on us yes he did
Then an angel and brought you on the wings of love
Did a doctor bring me like John said he did
And if a doctor brought me where they get kids
Well sweetheart can you keep a secret hmmm well just between a mother and her son
I'll tell ye you were born of love and that's where you came from
Well Bobby now do you know where you came from yes...where...love"

"I thought I'd like to lead the bachelor life for a while
Live alone and have some fun
So I told her to take the kids and go back to her mama
(That's how I wanted it to be) and I felt satisfied it was done
I wake up every morning make myself a cup of Jay
Down to the factory that's where I spend my day
Five o'clock the whistle blows and that leaves the evening free
That's how I wanted it to be
Well it didn't take me long to find out just how much I needed her
So I wrote and told her to take the kids
And come on back home cause I was ready to settle down now
Well you see I just got her letter today
And it seems she's found someone else someone she can depend on
(That's how I wanted it to be) and she ain't comin' home no more
I wake up every morning...
That's how I wanted it to be"
"Blue... like your eyes you left me blue
Like my heart you left me blue
On the night you told me
You could never love me
You said you could never let me through
To you that was true
True... I could hold a torch for you
Though you'd never love me true
I could rush to meet you
Every single morning
I can't believe you never knew
A true act of gentleness
A true act of tenderness
True..."
"You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space
[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your price
Start building up your walls and ever let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know
Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say, ""I'm just another fool and this is just another song""
But I know how you are 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again
[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your price
Start building up your walls and ever let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know
[Bridge]
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me
[Chorus]
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feeling things you never felt and spending all your time
Trying to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your price
Start building up your walls and ever let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know"
"Hey baby, let's jump in yo' truck
We'll ride and watch for lightnin' bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now
'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill singin' at night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, (and) don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good
We'll stop on a ol' dirt road bridge
Do you remember when we painted our names on it
And we'll listen to the creek as it runs
And we'll count the stars
Every single one
'Cause there ain't nothin' like the sound
Of a cooler slushin' on the bed 'a yo' truck
And ain't nothin' like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill singin' at night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, (and) don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good"
"She came to me with the summer
whispering gently
hello'.
She looked like she was a star fallen down from the sky.
I can remember her kisses
we didn't say a word.
Time was so precious to me and to my Julie.
Julie
Julie
my happiness was just a moment of time.
Summer is time for all lovers
beautiful month called July.
When you can feel love in the air
there by the seaside.
It was too good to last longer like any good thing in life.
Night passed so quickly for me and for my Tulie.
Julie
Julie
my happiness was just a moment of time.
Walking alone in the moonlight
hearing the wind by the sea.
I am not sure was it real or just a dream.
Numbering my lonely hours
waiting for Iuly ta cams.
Gazin' at flickering stars to find my Julie
Julie
Julie.
Julie
Julie
my happiness was just a moment of time.
Oh
my Julie."
"If I knew I could count on you
I would love you my whole life through
There is nothing that I would not do
If I knew I could count on you
I've been lonely for a long time
I've been looking everywhere
I need someone to believe in
I need someone that will care
And if I see that your love is true
I will gladly put my faith in you
There is nothing I would rather do
If I see that your love is true
I've been searching for a true love
I've been looking high and low
I've got all this love inside me
And it's good, nowhere to go
If I knew I could count on you
I would love you my whole life through
There is nothing that I would not do
If I knew I could count on you
And if I see that your love is true
I will gladly put my faith in you
There is nothing I would rather do
If I see that your love is true
If I knew I could count on you
I would love you my whole life through
There is nothing that I would not do
If I knew I could count on you"
"Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
I want to know you still remember me
The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming
The sweetest days are the days that used to be
The saddest words I've ever heard were words of parting
When you said sweetheart remember me
Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
Remember me at the close of a long long day
It would be so sweet when all alone
I'm dreaming just to know you still remember me
You told me once that you'd be mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity
But all those vows are broken now
And we will never be the same except in memory"
"I know you tried your best to love me
You smiled when your heart told you to weep
You tried to pretend that you were happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You gave the best years of your life, dear
And each precious vow you tried to keep
I love you so much I want you happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
Your heart is yearning for an old love
With new love it's useless to complete
It hurts me to know you are unhappy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You know that you are free to go, dear
And don't mind if I start to weep
I know I can never make you happy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep"
"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I hate going out in this storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow let it snow let it snow"
"Second hand shoes second hand clothes they all call her second hand rose
They all think they're pretty smart but rose don't have a second hand heart
I love a little girl who lives across the way I go to see her nearly every day
But when I get the money I'll take her far away
So they can't gather around her and say
Second hand shoes
They tease her about her clothes and things
It's hard to believe some folks can be so mean
But when I get the money I'll buy her the best
I'll take rose you can have all the rest
Second hand shoes
Second hand shoes"
"I was along neckin' with the boys at the local hot spot
In the midst of celebratin' this newfound freedom I've got
They ain't call them walking papers wasn't even right
So when she brought 'em here tonight
I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce
But she's a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man
How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight
All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time
'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be
This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right
She's a looking like a new woman
She is in neon light
She's gone from every day square
To party hardy, wild thing, overnight
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
Sleek blond with a faking big ten
Sure hits a bad time for me to be her actual man
She's emptying every barstool, got the boys formed in a line
I think I'll slip on back 'cause I can't take the sight
But her a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident
Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hands
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man
She picked a hell of a time for me to be her actual man"
"I'm watching you go from room to room
With all your boxes and your broom
Packing up, sweeping out and taking down
From off the wall
Everything that's part of us
Tear my whole world down if you must
Don't even leave one little speck of dust
Make sure you've got it all
[Chorus]
Take my heart, take my soul
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here to catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all
Don't even leave one photograph
The memory of one smile or laugh
Check the closet up in the attic and down the hall
Take your time, take your rings
Take the sandbox and the swings
Without a family they're just things
Make sure you've got it all
[Chorus]"
"Hey sister moon you shine and shine
You say you need my lovin' but you want to be free
And you've made up your mind
Ah sister moon I am your sun
You have your independence
Except for the one that you depend on
You say you're tired you'll be living without me
You know what it is to be alone
You'll find yourself another companion
You'll never need to be back home
Ah sister moon I am your sun
You have your independence
Except for the one that you depend on
You say you're tired you'll be living without me
You know what it is to be alone
You'll find yourself another companion
You'll never need to be back home
Sister moon sister moon"
"It's heavy down here.
Pressure building day-to-day,
Everyone's got too much to say.
It's heavy down here.
It's heavy down here.
Thunder clouds roiling in the late afternoon,
Old Man rising from his noon day snooze.
It's heavy down here.
It's heavy down here.
A final post for all to see,
The loving embrace of Infamy.
It's heavy down here.
It's too damn heavy down here.
He took a small box
And he buried it away.
""Now my heart will be home
So I need not stay""."
"After The Flood (Chris Jonat)
After the flood
When the world is of mud
And we send out the dove
And it doesn't return
Do you think then
All the king's men
Will start over again
Is that when we'll learn
First was the word
Which became flesh
That's only the beginning
I can't remember the rest
It seems I'm always forgetting
First was the fall
Bought by the death
Glory stands waiting
With baited breath
I'm always missing my mark"
"Look under his floorboards, Mama,
I don't trust his silly grin
He's got a beat-up Rambler, Nebraska plates,
And I ain't getting in
I don't like the way his pinky ring
Picks up the dashboard light
Or his short little piggy fingers
Or the way his belt is cinched too tight
Check under his floorboards, Mama,
I don't like his suggestive tone
The way his words drip from his mouth
As he asks can I take you home?
I don't care how many miles I got,
I think I'd rather walk them alone
Than to sit in the back seat
As his eyes in the mirror
Reduce me to flesh and bone
Check under his floorboards, Mama,
'cause that razor's not just a threat to me
He'll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart,
Without laying a sweaty palm to your cheek
Don't accuse me of running scared,
Listen to what I'm saying
It's a fucked up ol' world, but this ol' girl
Well, she ain't giving in"
"I never believed the woman like you existed
Somewhere along the way my mind got twisted
But you brought hope and understanding gave sweet love without demanding
How could I ever dream the more than this
Let's build a world together just for two
Let's put our dreams together and watch them all come true
Let's leave the world of tears and heartaches far behind
Let's build a world together yours and mine
We fill our world with music and children's laughter
And cherrish every hour we spend together
And every night we rediscover just how much we love each other
And dream about the things we'll do tomorrow
Let's build a world together...
Let's build a world together yours and mine"
"Losing your love that was mine brings hurt and lonely time
Losing your love I fall through brings tears and heartaches too
I should've known and never let you hurt me ever
But I was blind love stood in the way
Yes I lost in this game thought I'd do the same thing
If you fell in love with me again
Losing your love that was mine brings tears and lonely time
I should've known and never let you hurt me ever"
"I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
Oh, John, oh John, oh what did you say
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I'll meet you there on the crowning day
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
Oh, some comes cripple and some comes lame
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
Some comes walking in Jesus' name
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
Old Judas rested upon his shoulder
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I'll meet you there at the first crossover
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord
To walk into Jerusalem, just like John"
"(Dolly Parton)
I was lookin' for greener pastures
When I left my old Kentucky home
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master
So I left the one that loved me all along
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better
Didn't care about the grief I left behind
Didn't even make a card or write a letter
So sure I'd be successful in no time
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?
How what you have is never good enough
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up
Well the seasons came, they went
The dreams all shattered
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin
I'm heading for bluer pastures"
"She grew up in the backwood country
Found her dreams in movie magazines
Now she's gone looking for her castle
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
City lights oh you took my darling
And the love that she promised me
After wine and big city parties
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
Sold my house to Raverend Smith last Sunday
Left my farm with Abraham McGee
Had to go and rescue my darling
From the life like your city folks lead
I found her dressed in fancy silks and satin
Spending money like it grew on trees
Living high in a big white mansion
What chance is there for a poor boy like me
What chance is there for a poor boy like me"
"From the first breath of her life
She flew straight into my arms
I used to catch her from the swings
When she was five...
And now she dances on the wind
In a world as hard as stone
She's so anxious to begin
And ready to fly...
And she walks with me
And she talks with me
As she holds her hand in mine
I know she'll find her way
Like the light of day
Cause it's love that makes her strong
Though I cannot stop the rain
And I cannot turn the tide
And I'm sure there will be things
That break her heart
I can only let her know
I am always on her side
And even as I let her go
I'll never be far
And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In her eyes I see her truth
Born of her fire and grace
As she finds her place
Cause it's love that makes her strong"
"If there's water in the desert sand out in the sea
If you were not an angel sweet as you can be
You could turn the night to day make all my dreams come true
Say how far it is to heaven then I'll stop loving you
If the earth is up above us stars are down below
If there are daisies in the desert roses in the snow
If today can be tomorrow if old things can be new
If you can live without a heartbeat then I'll stop loving you
There's no daisies in the desert no roses in the snow
The earth is not above us the stars are not below
Today can't be tomorrow old things can't be new
I can't live without a heartbeat and I can't stop loving you"
"Well all the boys are talkin' 'bout your brand new car
Drivin' the girls crazy like a movie star
They say it's shiny black and really sexy
Baby don't you know by now that stuff don't impress me
I don't need four in the floor, three little words will do
If you want to get next to me, well, ""Come here you""
Come here you
Hey, you can come on over here
Come here you
I'm ready, willing and able my dear
Come here you
Well, who do you think I'm talkin' to
Come here you
Well a girl like me needs verbal stimulation
When we're down to the final negotiations
I'm not puttin' on airs, I'm just tellin' it straight
I feel an urgent need for us to incorporate
Don't need Kreskin here to tell us just what we're gonna do
Hey, pay attention boy, I'm talkin' to you
Now, come here you, I love to watch ya walk that walk
Come here you, I love to hear you talk that talk
Come here you, do everything I tell you to
Now come here you
I must admit at times I may be overzealous
But I've been tryin' out some things mothers never tell us
Girls I'm here to testify to each and every one of you
Every sin that's been committed, your little mamma did it too
Oh! I'm sorry little darlin', look how you drive me to distraction
Now let's get back down to business, how's about a little action
Now come here you
Hey, you come on over here
Come here you, tell me what's a girl gotta do
Come here you, I love to watch you walk that walk
Come here you, I love to hear you talk that talk
Come here you, do everything I tell you to"
"The lameness of an unborn child
The tidiness of cry
The only way I'm leaving here
Is curling up and die
The way our shelter moves above
Controlled by just my hand
Insures the death you're dreaming of
The drowning down of man
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
And always love the smiling one
And rounding out will come
With bitter bile and heartless fun
And consciousness made numb
And fearful hate that's stemming out
From fear and only fear
Has made your inner croco shout
And bring his victims here
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
A creature born in listlessness
His hatred to become
It's here his love is swollen in
And consciousness made numb
And relegate your youth and trust
Your table and your skin
And share the love the godly must
And hold it til the end
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true"
"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
Darlin I, will be lovin' you
Till we're seventy
And baby my heart
Could still feel as hard at twenty three
And I'm thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love
Right where we are
When my hairs all but gone
And my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cos honey your soul
Could never grow old
It's evergreen
And baby your smiles
Forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That baby now
Take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Baby we found love
Right where we are"
"I might wear my jeans too tight
I might kick up my heels all night
I may take a notion to flirt
Or say a word I wouldn't say in church
I might have a hidden tattoo
I may show it to you
I might even make you blush
And I will be mysterious
(Chorus)
I ain't one to show restraint
I ain't never been no saint
And I hate to ruin your plans
But If you're looking for a one night stand
I ain't
We might be the perfect match
You might be quite a catch
You may know what to say
You could take my breath away
I might let you take me a flick
I might let you give me a kiss
I will let you buy me a drink
And I am smarter than you think
(repeat Chorus))
You might
You may
I could
But I ain't"
"(Lainie Marsh)
I hear the clock a tickin'
See the sweat upon my brow
I know my destination
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'm running on desire
Baby I've got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel
Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go
There's a junkyard dog a barkin'
In the valley down below
He's wanting me to stop and
Gather up a heavy load
Ain't gonna heed his call
Ain't givin' him the time of day
You mangy mutt once and for all
I said I threw that stuff away
I won't have a bit of trouble
Heading down the straight and true
I'll fly solo on the double
Into the yonder blue
I might need some intervention
Out upon the icy turn
In a foggy situation
Squealin' on a hairpin curve
I'm running on desire
Baby I've got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel
Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Got a ways to go, got a ways to go"
"Some glad morning when this life is over,
I'll fly away to a home in God's celestial shore,
CHORUS
I'll(fly away) fly away, Oh glory
I'll (fly away) fly away (in the morning)
When I die Hallelujah, by and by
I'll (fly away) fly away (I'll fly away)
When the shadows of this life have grown
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars have flown
Ill fly away
CHORUS
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end,
I'll fly away
CHORUS"
"If you don't want to run around if you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you
There's a lotta pretty girls in this wide wide world
But none of them should hold a life to you
You're the nicest the neatest the cutest and the sweetest
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
If you don't want to run around
Did you really mean it or did I just dream it when you said I was the one for you
Too late to forget it too late to regret it the day that I fell in love with you
If you don't want to run around"
"I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like to the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even with you
'Cause you're leavin'
And songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year
Well it's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year"
"Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around 1 am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be alright
'Cause she said
""Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely""
Now it didn't take me a second 'til I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said ""Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two.""
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says,
""Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely""
Baby, baby, baby just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No,no,no,no
Not tonight, now baby
""Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely""
Baby, baby just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby, baby, baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
So come on baby
Said, ""I'll be there in a minute or two.""
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeah"
"Oh the sun's gonna shine in my life once more love's gonna live here again
And things're gonna be the way they were before love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here love's gonna live here love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness only happiness love's gonna live here again
I hear bells're ringin' I hear birds're singin' love's gonna live here again
I hear bees a hummin' and I know the days're comin' love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here
Yeah love's gonna live here again"
"Hey there baby, what do you say?
There's a look in your eyes, lookin' my way
Castin' your stare my way all night
Got a crazy idea I think you'd like
Hey sweet sugar, in her sexy boots
How 'bout a drive down the avenue
Thinkin' about a new tattoo
I'd love to see my name in ink on you
Let's go rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin', forever ain't enough
Fallin', in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up, yeah
Oh, I got a real fast jet black Pontiac
Enough cash in a suitcase to never come back
Been thinkin' 'bout flying down to paradise
It won't be the same if you're not by my side
Rockin', 'til the sun comes up
Talkin', forever ain't enough
Fallin', in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up, yeah
Oh, yeah (Yeah)
Keep on fallin' 'til you just let go
Keep on fallin', baby, here we go
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin', forever ain't enough
Fallin' fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin', forever ain't enough
Fallin' fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up, yeah
(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) When the sun comes up
(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) When the sun comes up
(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) C'mon, c'mon baby, baby
(Keep on fallin') When the sun comes up, yeah"
"Endless highway,
As far as I can see
The road'll take me
Back to him tonight
It's been so long since
I've seen him smile
I'll be counting all the miles
'Til I get home
[Chorus:]
How many hours
'Til I hold him?
How many days
Before we hit the road again?
Endless highway,
He don't know
How much I miss him
Heading down this road,
Bound for Tennessee
Lonesome feeling,
Deep inside my heart
Longing for
This weary night to end
I'll think about him,
Try to keep my tired eyes open
Come the morning light,
I'll be back home again
[Chorus x 2]"
"Are you weary and tired of living
Does it all seem to be thankless giving
Don't worry my friend it isn't the end
It's just a bend in the road
Have you reached for someone's hand
And found that's she just doesn't understand
Keep reaching my friend it isn't the end
It's just a bend in the road
It's never the end there's always one more bend
Another day another way a year or two
So walk one more mile remember with the smile
Happiness can afford to lose you
Although at times you feel so lonely
And you try to find someone to love you only
Keep looking my friend it isn't the end
There'll may be someone around the bend in the road
There'll may be someone around the bend in the road"
"Well alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong
Well alright, alright I didn't know you felt that strong
Well alright you made your point
I didn't plan to stay this long
Alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong.
You said that love could make a king
Give up his crown for just one thing
I was lookin' for a little princess for just one night
But alright, alright yeah. yeah.
[Chorus:]
Well alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong
Well alright, alright I didn't know you felt that strong
Well alright you made your point,
I didn't plan to stay this long
So alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong.
[--- Instrumental ---]
I heard that love's flame can blind
But slowly burn out over time
Now we'll know that it just gets stronger
And I can see you're right
As the years go by.
[Chorus:]
Well alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong
Alright, alright I didn't know you felt that strong
Well, alright you made your point,
I didn't plan to stay this long
So alright, alright, alright,
So alright, alright, alright,
Well, alright, alright alright girl I'm wrong.
Girl I'm wrong
Well, Alright, alright I didn't know you felt that strong
Well, alright you made your point,
I didn't plan to stay this long
So alright, alright, alright, alright girl I'm wrong."
"(It's gonna take a lot more than a memory for I had the real thing too long)
I keep telling myself I'll be all right with the mem'ry that you left behind
But it will take a lot more than a memory to keep me from losin' my mind
My memories won't last as a shield from the past
They break down and cry out when we're alone
I need a lot more than a memory for I had the real thing too long
[ strings ]
For a while I can pull myself together with a mem'ry and a drink for my heart
But it will take a lot more than a memory to keep me from falling apart"
"Grandpa had a piano it was built in 1904
He brought it down from Sydney town before the First World War
He'd sit down and crack his knuckles put his glasses on his head
When he'd start to play the cat would run and hide behind the bed
Well his right foot stomped the pedals and his left foot stomped the floor
His wrinkled hands would skip the keys that wouldn't play no more
He'd play Onward Christian Soldiers and the window panes would shake
When the man of 87 played his old 88
The piano sat in a corner on a sagging hardwood floor
On top was a frame I made for him with a picture of the Lord.
A faded baptist hymnal took it's place above the keys
We'd take turns sitting by him he'd nod we'd turn the page
Well the old piano's silent now it don't ring with joy no more
Except sometimes when the cat jumps down when there's someone at the door
I can see him up in heaven with a smile upon his face
When God and all the angels let him lead Amazing Grace"
"A candle burning for everything I've ever wanted
A tattoo burned for everything I've ever wanted and lost
I had a long list of names that I kept in my back pocket,
But I've cut it down to one and your name's at the top
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster
I found myself a friend,
But he's crooked as a stick in water
So now I'm writing fairy tales
To catch the spirit of revenge
He's got a plan to steal my little sister,
But I'm not too concerned
'Cause I will get him in the end
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster
Going to find me someone to share
A common disaster
Run away with me from a life so cramped and dull
Not worry too much about the happily-ever-after
Just keep the Caddy moving
'Til we're well beyond that hill
Won't you share a common disaster?
Share with me a common disaster
A common disaster"
"Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could di-ie
Bye bye my love goodby-eye
There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Chorus
I'm-a through with romance, I'm a-through with love
I'm through with a'countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me
Chorus"
"A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me
So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I'd come home forever
[Chorus]
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home
No work said the boss at the bunkhouse door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
[Chorus]
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me
[Chorus]
One more dollar, boys, I'm going home"
"Oh, play me a blue song
fade down the light
I'm sad as a proud man can be sad tonight
Just let me dream on oh just let me sway
While the sweet violins and the saxophones play
and miss, you don't know me but can't we pretend?
that we care for each other till the band reach the end?
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
Oh, they say love's for gamblin'
the pendulum swings
I bet out on love and I lost everything
but don't send me home now
put a shot in my arm
and we'll drink out old memories and we'll drink until dawn.
and Mr. Band leader wont you play one more time
for I've got folding money in this pocket of mine
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
and miss, you don't know me but can't we pretend
that we care for each other till the band reach the end?
Oh, one step for aching
two steps for breakin'
Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
one step for sighing
two steps for crying
waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love
Oh Waltzing's for dreamers and losers in love"
"I don't want nobody
I'm better off alone
I'm sworn to independence
My heart is made of stone
But you're breakin' on through
Oh, there's something 'bout you
I've been tapping my toes
To the way you talk
And I've been singin' along
To the way you walk
I've got to do
Something 'bout you
Well, I've got this place of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh, there's something 'bout you
Somethin' about you like distant thunder
And I can't say I ain't been warned
But there's no shelter to crawl under
Ever gonna save me from this storm
Oh, there's something 'bout you
That I can't shake
There's somethin' 'bout you
That's been keeping me awake
The whole night through
Oh, there's something 'bout you
Well, I've got this life of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh, there's something 'bout you
Babe, something 'bout you"
"At Oranmore in the County Galway,
One pleasant evening in the month of May,
I spied a damsel, she was young and handsome
Her beauty fairly took my breath away.
Chorus:
She wore no jewels, nor costly diamonds,
No paint or powder, no, none at all.
But she wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it
And round her shoulder was a Galway Shawl.
We kept on walking, she kept on talking,
'Till her father's cottage came into view.
Says she, ""Come in, sir, and meet my father,
And play to please him The Foggy Dew.""
She sat me down beside the fire
I could see her father, he was six feet tall.
And soon her mother had the kettle singing
All I could think of was the Galway shawl.
I played The Blackbird and The Stack of Barley
Rodney's Glory and The Foggy Dew
She sang each note like an Irish linnet.
Whilst the tears stood in her eyes of blue.
'Twas early, early, all in the morning,
When I hit the road for old Donegal.
She said goodbye, sir, she cried and kissed me,
And my heart remained with that Galway shawl."
"The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight. I'm reminded of the arms that held me tight. Last time I held you it ended all to soon we were lying underneath a yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.
Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon. I ask him are you happy or if you're blue. I start to reminisce to summers night in June, we fell in love underneath a yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon.
There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky oh I wonder if you're watching it too. There's a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky wherever you are it's watching over you. Oh shine on, shine on yellow moon."
"Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind
He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon
And honey is there somethin' wrong
She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
He left that phone danglin' off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
She said, don't bother comin' home
By time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything
And she always expected the worst
In the back of her mind"
"Everybody's doing a brand-new dance, now

"I'm a man of constant sorrow I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow and I won't be back this way
Misery is nothing new to me memories will fade in time
Another day some new tomorrow just might ease my troubled mind
I'm a man of constant sorrow
I just can't be the man you've made of me only you know how I tried
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow maybe then you'll be satisfied
Cause I'm a man of constant sorrow and I won't be back this way"
"The first sound I heard was a woman's cry
The first word I learned to utter was goodbye
Forgive me if I'm wrong in what I do to you
While passin' through passin' through
Happiness for me cannot be found but yet I still search from town to town
No offence but I don't think I'll find it here with you
Goodbye babe just passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
No woman needs or can hold the love I give her
Please understand I can't control these things I do
While passin' through passin' through
What was that did you say you thought you loved me
That's too bad girl cause if you really do
You'll just awaken with the dawn and find your love has flown
Like an old wild goose passin' through
Passin' through your life like a ragin' river
Like a cold north wind jus a passin' through
Goodbye babe passin' through"
"Forever yours I'll always be please say that you'll give your sweet love to me
Forever yours my love will be I will take care of you say you love me
I started living the day I found you I love you with all my heart say you love me too
I will stay beside you and I will guide you forever yours please say that you're mine
Forever yours I'll always be...
I will take care of you say you love me"
"Hope you like the way I talk
The way I smile, the way I walk
Hope you're in to how I dress
The way I think
And all the rest - 'cause
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
When you're driftin' off to sleep
Close your eyes and think of me
Make it easy on yourself
Don't dream about
Nobody else - 'cause
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
You can run and you can hide
But in the end you'll realize
You've been runnin' right to me
Turn around
And there I'll be
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you
It ain't a matter of chance
Honey, it's destiny
There ain't no getting' away
It's just the way it's gonna be
I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you"
"You say your heart's been broken
And you just can't win
You say that you'll never love again
Let me tell you friend
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Looked out my window and what did I see
It's another broken family
The kids are stayin' with mama at home
Daddy's livin' in a house all alone
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
Troubled times make it hard to stay
So many lovers take the easy way
But don't go crazy and jump ship too soon
Cause every day can't be a honeymoon
You can't give up on love
That's the one thing we've got to keep going
Cause it don't come easy and it's so hard to hold
But you can't give up on love
No, you can't give up on love
Oh, you can't give up on love"
"Carolyn let me tell you what I've heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city bright in the night time like day
There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Oh their warm lips like a honeycomb dripped with honey
And there's something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone
Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
Sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home
Yes Carolyn a man will do that..."
"VERSE 1
I want you to know I thought Id see you tonight
But youre too damn stubborn to see wrong and right
Where did you go, youve been here all of my life
I guess it got too hot and you just couldnt handle the fire
CHORUS
But youre not the first you know, and you wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens, waitin down at the pass
When you figure it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let you on the train that Im on, cause its movin too fast
VERSE 2
Her name was Amy, it was 1992
I promised her the world and she promised me the moon
But she couldnt take it, my life and the road
She listened to the voices, packed her bags and headed back home
CHORUS
Shes not the first you know and she wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens, waitin down at the pass
But when she figures it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let her on the train that Im on cause its movin too fast
VERSE 3
So take a deep breath, and free your mind
Light all you r candles and jump to the fire
You cant see me for the smoke, its heaven and its hell
But I wont be surprised or hurt, if you decide to bail
CHORUS
But youre not the first you know, and you wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens waitin down at the pass
And when you figure it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let you on the train that Im on, cause its movin too fast"
"I met you and we married we planned our future well
We built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties...
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built"
"Before I knew your name, I was not blistered or burned
I gave love everything before you had it returned
Before I knew your name, I had my pride in tact
But you set my heart on fire before you gave it back
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Ain't no drink or drug
That's gonna get me there
I've been down that road, your still just as gone
After the fog has cleared
So I'm gonna rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Is it somewhere south of Austin?
Hiding in St. Paul
In the deserts east of L.A.
Hell, I might try them all
Somewhere to rewind to a place and time
To the man I was, before your love
Wrecked my heart, and my soul, and my mind
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name
Before I knew your name, before I knew your name"
"LOVE'S ENDLESS WAR
WRITER ROGER COOK
Hearts have been broken
in the game of true love
I'm afraid to surrender
I'm not strong enough
Give it all away
open up every door
My heart is a castle
in love's endless war
Dreams can betray you
When you're far out that sea
Many proud hearts have foundered
on love's mutiny"
"Everybody says don't lose your head
You gotta keep that pretty smile upon your face
Well I did that for awhile but it just was not my style
I kept endin' up in that forbidden place
I'm a happy woman but when I get knocked to the ground
I invite the blues to come around
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high
I put on the saddest song ignore the telephone
I go ahead and cry the make-up from my eyes
I let my mind play tricks and then
I let it fool me once again
Into thinkin' that I'll never be alright
Then when I'm no longer crazy and I'm back to my old self
I realize how good I've always felt
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high
Let yourself go under
Touch the bottom of the pool
Ain't it strange and don't you wonder
How you always come back up and it's so cool
So don't be afraid to cry get down as far as you can go
Let the river rage on by and the wind blow
If you pay your dues in darkness
You'll appreciate the light
Cause a deep down low makes level feel so high"
"If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A tear may appear when I hold you near but that's for the sweet things you do
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
By your side I will stay till we're old and gray reminiscing the moments we knew
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
A thief couldn't steal the joy that I feel heaven for me has come true
If my heart had windows you'd see a heart full of love just for you
Oh by your side I will stay"

(Key lime pie.) (My, my, my key lime pie.) (Key lime pie.) (Key lime pie.) (My, my, my key lime pie.) (Key lime pie.) (Key lime pie.) (My, my, my key lime pie.)"
"""The air in here smells like piss and beer
The sweet cycle of life"", Georgie E would say.
Thirteen grandchildren gathered around
Looking down into the ground.
""A slow descent into darkness,
I deserve no less"",
His last words carried like an offering
Upon his dying breath.
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be.
I live, like in a dream, among the ruins,
Of what has been.
The slow descent into madness,
The churning swell of love and chaos
What was once at hand was now
Forbade to touch.
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be.
Annie won't you sit and have another drink with me?
I'll keep them waiting while you sip your tea.
Annie won't you sit and list them one more time,
The reasons why I failed to to keep you mine?
Regret is for your those with choices,
Those will voices,
Those with reasons to stick around.
So cast me deep into those black depths
With the reassurance that Death gets
The sons-of-bitches too.
(and they won't be coming back for you)
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and me.
The sweet, sweet cycle of you and I.
The sweet, sweet memories of you and me
And the way we used to be
When we were free,
How I long to be."
"Midnight drive down on Jewella Rd.
Methamphetamines and carryin a lonely load
Roaches in the ashes, truck jamming ""Limelight""
Look like it's gonna be just me and Geddy Lee tonight
Shreveport, Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine
Glasspacks hummin by Circle In The Square
Heavy Metal Rednecks and their frizzy blonde hair
Fuck a bunch a hair-do boys and their Spandex britches
And their big titty, fancy drunk ass bitches
Shreveport, Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine
David Green called me to pick him up after work
Said to bring him some cold beer and a fresh clean shirt
Said he was already broke and he just got paid
We spent the rest of the night singin' by his Mama's grave
Shreveport, Oh Shreveport
Wonder where I'll be when the sun comes t' shine"

"I'm sorry, so sorry
That I was such a fool
I didn't know
Love could be so cruel
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uh-oh
Oh, yes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done
[Spoken:]
(I'm sorry) I'm sorry
(So sorry) So sorry
Please accept my apology
But love is blind
And I was to blind to see
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uh-oh
Oh, yes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that don't right
The wrong that's been done
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uh-oh
Oh, yes"
"Just divorced was written
On the window of the car
It looked like a tombstone
Parked beside the local bar
Once he'd drove it crazy
Now he's driven it too far
Just divorced was written
On the window of the car
Someone wrote in soap
It's over right across the hood
On the door it said good riddance
Boy, I feel good
On the fender were the words
I won't be home tonight
And the jukebox in the bar played
If you're gonna do me wrong do it right
Laughed so hard I thought now
There's a guy who's got some spunk
What a sense of humor
It said goodbye on the trunk
Tin cans tied with paper streamers
Pointing to the bar
Just divorced was written
On the window of the car
Just divorced was written"
"There you were standing there smiling as you made your plans
You were going to leave me and go with him
You said you loved him so and your love would always be
And that's the very same thing you once told to me
And you still had my little golden band on your hand
Does my little band of gold mean nothing to you
To me it means the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
There you were standing there
So take my little golden band from your hand
My little band of gold means nothing to you
To me it meant the world but you've torn my world apart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart
You're leaving me alone with my broken heart"
"That time I mentioned I was moving
And you said you'd help me move
I almost went out and bought some shit
So I'd need your help to move
'Cause I got a crush on you
Remember that Halloween
When I went as Jimmy Dean
You were a princess, or a gypsy, or whatever
I was James Dean
And I had a crush on you
I get a yes, a no, a maybe
From the magic 8 ball of your mind
I saw your mom's Camaro
Dammit girl, you lookin' fine
And I got a crush on you
Day in, day out, same routine
Better know what you think
Before you say what you mean
Same old, same old, season after season
Baby, you're the kind of thing I do without reason
The sky's an 80 ft. mirror
With a fancy beveled edge
Couldn't make it any clearer
I'm alone on this ledge
Just me and my crush on you
Teenage hair-dos, bad leather
Mom's apartment, ethyl cans
I wa-wa-wanna
Take you to the dance
'Cause I got a crush on you
Some girls make me reach for the bottle
Some girls make me reach for the sky
You got me reaching in every direction for
Just one good reason why
I gotta have this crush on you
That time I mentioned I was moving
And you said you'd help me move"
"I don't want to wait until it's Friday
Before we hit it sideways
I'm out in your driveway right now
And we ain't gotta wait until it's your birthday
I'm already thirsty, time to shut the workday on down
Yeah I just dropped you off but I'm back to pick you up
No, I can't get enough, need a little more you in my cup
I want to see you move, get my hands on you
My little d?j? vu, we do this every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little unzip zip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Turn around down the end of Main Street
When the song is over we put it on repeat, repeat
Popping off another can of crazy
Neighbors probably hate me
They don't get the way we do it every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night

Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little unzip zip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night, that's right baby it's going down"
"I always thought you were the best
I guess I always will
I always thought that we were blessed
And I feel that way still
Sometimes we took the hard road
But we always saw it through
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Sometimes the world was on our side
Sometimes it wasn't fair
Sometimes it gave a helping hand
Sometimes we didn't care
'Cause when we were together
It made the dream come true
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Someone who understands me
And knows me inside out
Helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt,
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you
Someone
And knows me inside out
Helps keep me together
And believes without a doubt,
That I could move a mountain
Someone to tell it to
If I had only one friend left
I'd want it to be you"
"An American landed on Erin's green isle
He gazed on killarny with a rapturous smile
How can I buy it he said to the guy
I'll tell you how with a smile he replied
How can you buy all the stars in the sky
How can you buy two Blue Irish eyes
When you can purchase a fine mothers heart
Then you can buy killarny
Nature restore on her guilt's with a smile
Me and Rose the shamrock and the barley
When you can buy all those wonderful things
Then you can buy killarny
Over in Killarny, Many years ago,
there's a song my mother sang to me
in a voice so sweet and low.
Just a simple Irish ditty,
In her sweet ould fashion way,
And I'd give the world if I could hear
That song of hers today.
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Hush, now don't you cry!
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
That's an Irish lullaby."
"Mama taught us how to sing in harmony
Grandma used to stomp her foot and slap her knee
I can still hear daddy singin'
Down by the old mill stream
When uncle Jim played the fiddle
You could hear it talk you could hear it sing
And it echoed down the mountains
To those Georgia pines
Ran through Tennessee just like that old moonshine
Old Joe Clark Cripple Creek Annie Get Your Gun
I guess my old time favorite was yhat Fox on the Run
Like a fox, like a fox on the run
Grandpa played the dobro till the break of dawn
Me I had this guitar and I'd strum along
Carol played the washboard and the tamborine
Little Mary Beth would always help us sing
And it echoed down the mountains...
Mama taught us how to sing in harmony
Grandma used to stomp her foot and slap her knee
I can still hear daddy singin'
Down by the old mill stream
When uncle Jim played the fiddle
You could hear it talk you could hear it sing
[ fiddle - dobro ]
And it echoed down the mountains
To those Georgia pines
Ran through Tennessee just like that old moonshine
Old Joe Clark Cripple Creek Annie Get Your Gun
I guess my old time favorite was yhat Fox on the Run
Like a fox, like a fox on the run"
"Momma gives birth to a little child,
Daddy waits, with a patient smile.
They tell him what he's brought into the world,
They all can tell she'll be a daddy's girl.
He hears a voice as she starts to cry,
He looks through the window tears fall from his eyes,
Overwhelmed with the thoughts of the day,
He swears he hears her say
Daddy can you see me?
Daddy can you hear the words I say?
I've got your hands
Your eyes and your hair
And this thing you call a teddy bear.
I'll do what I can to make you proud,
Daddy can you see me now?
He takes me fishing like I'm one of the guys
No one can break these ties that bind.
We've got a bond that's precious and dear,
And it's stayed the same through all these years.
As I get older and time goes by,
He's got a shoulder if I need to cry,
And when I think that I'm going O.K.,
I look at him and say
Daddy can you see me?
Daddy can you hear the words I say?
I've got your hands
Your eyes and your hair
And I still hold on to my teddy bear.
I'll do what I can to make you proud,
Daddy can you see me now?
I look to the heavens for some kind of sign,
For you to tell me that I'm doing fine.
And every night when I kneel down to pray,
I wonder if you hear me say
Daddy can you see me?
Daddy can you hear the words I say?
My life has changed since you went away
And I need to know if I'm doing O.K.
I've done all I can to make you proud
Daddy can you see me now?
Oh I've done all I can to make you proud,
Daddy can you see me now?"
"It sure is cold this morning
They're hangin' lights in the trees downtown
The Indian summer is over
The fall fell away and blew out with the cold northern wind
He swore forever
Couldn't measure his love
But she's all alone under
Gray skies above
Like a bird in December
Who didn't fly south
Time just ran out
She's a bird in December
Hearts that love blind
Sometimes get left behind
Her feathers are too bright for this dull town
Her colors are all wasted here
She followed him here for the summer
But like seasons all disappear, suddenly he was gone
It's all so much clearer
Watching from the outside
We all saw it coming
She didn't get out in time
She's a bird in December
Who didn't fly south
Time just ran out
She's a bird in December
Hearts that love blind
Sometimes get left behind
Oh, the winter won't last, the sun will come out
Well, I know she'll find love again but right now
She's a bird in December
Like a bird in December
Who didn't fly south
Time just ran out
She's a bird in December
Hearts that love blind
Sometimes get left behind
The storm, it won't last
December will pass"
"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
Callin' Baton Rouge
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change
Callin' Baton Rouge
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time
Callin' Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge
My Baton Rouge, oh oh oh"
"Floatin' away like a bottle in the water
Sun down here just feels a little hotter
Burnin' away today 'cause I ain't got her no more, no more
Somethin' kinda dark about stone white beaches
Nobody here practice what they preaches
The truth is, the truth ain't worth what I'm reaching for
In the distance I hear tequila talk
And college chicks in the parking lot
While I just lay here starin' up at God
With sand in my soul
Beer in my veins
Lettin' my hair grow in room 108
Gettin' over you, I ain't even gonna try
'Cause I'm on a roll
Fillin' up this hole
With sand in my soul
Headphones, shades, never gettin' rattled
Spent all day just building you a castle
It's okay if you're back in the saddle at home, back home
I hate to say I'm glad you broke my heart
And I hate to say it isn't tearing me apart
But I love the way this tiki bar is somehow never closed
Sand in my soul
Beer in my veins
Lettin' my hair grow in room 108
Gettin' over you, I ain't even gonna try
'Cause I'm on a roll
Fillin' up this hole
With sand in my soul
In the distance I hear tequila talk
And college chicks in the parking lot
While I just lay here starin' up at God
Sand in my soul
Beer in my veins
Lettin' my hair grow down to my waist
Gettin' over you, I ain't even gonna try
'Cause I'm on a roll
Fillin' up this hole
With sand in my soul
Sand in my soul"
"All you want to do is sit around and pout and now I've got enough so I'm gettin' out
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
I've been in the doghouse for so doggone long
That when I get a kiss I think that somethin's wrong
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
[ guitar ]
I'll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go and get yourself a man that wants to fight
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
You start your jaws a waggin' and they never stop
You never shut your moth until I blow my top
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
[ steel ]
I remember back when you were nice and sweet
Things have changed you'd rather fight than eat
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow
I'm gonna do some ridin' on the midnight train
I'm taking evrything except my balled chain
I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you anyhow"
"Given up on traveling'
It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train
Now a mind can wonder
And that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be
I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say
About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong
But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
Somewhere I slipped off track
I was thinking I could fly
But there never was a train
That couldn't try"
"Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
An old dirt road
I wanna see your bare feet on my dash
The night wind blowing your hair back
Slide across that seat
And sit real close
Baby, let's go
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll kick 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We'll take some blankets and we'll make a spread
I'll tuck you into my pick-up bed
We'll watch the country stars
Puttin' on a show
I want to see your bare skin in the moonlight
Kiss your lips, girl, and hold you all night
Make a lot of love
And make it real slow
Baby, let's go
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We've been runnin' 'round doin' this and that
It's time we got back to what we're good at
Snugglin' up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We'll be doin' that thing we do
Doin' that thing we do"
"Back when we let the good times roll
You held on to my heart and soul
It wasn't really very long ago
Let's go back again
Reach out and turn the TV off
Slow down and let the world get lost
Slip into something nice and soft
And lie here in my arms
Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me
Take all your dreams and shattered hopes
And every angry word we ever spoke
Trade 'em in for a couple cherry Cokes
And stay here for a while
There are no questions that we need to ask
Every precious kiss could be our last
There is no future and there is no past
All we've got is now
Love me like you love me
Do it like you mean it one more time tonight
Hold me close and love me like you love me"
"For years and years I've rambled
I drank my wine and gambled
But then one day I thought I'd settle down
I met a sweet little lady
And she told me that she'd be my baby
We build a cottage in the old hometown
I can't forget my good old rambling days
Them old freight trains keep calling me always
I may be rough, may be wild
May act tough but it's just my style
'Cause I can't forget my good old rough and rowdy ways
Sometimes when I meet a bounder
Who knew me when I was a rounder
He grabs my hand and he'll say, ""Boy, have a drink""
We go down to the poolroom
Get in the gang and then soon
It's broad daylight and I ain't had a wink
I can't forget my good old rambling days
Them old freight trains keep calling me always
May be rough, may be wild
May act tough but it's just my style
'Cause I can't forget my good old rough and rowdy ways"
"I wandered so aimless life filled with sin I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light no more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered along worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like a blind man God gave back his sight praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light...
I was a fool to wander astray straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light..."
"He don't know how to lie or undermine you
He don't know how to steal how to deal or decieve
So leave him alone set him free
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel that only he can see
You say he's so helpless but what about you
You don't pull the strings don't you know anything
Leave him alone let him be
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel that only he can see
Would you teach him about heaven
Would you show him how to love the earth

Would you poison him with prejudice from the moment of his birth
SOLO
He in the name of love in the blood of the lamb
He that never lays the blame
He don't even know his name
Leave him alone set him free
Cause he's speaking with the angel
Speaking with the angel
The very one that spoke to you and me
Do you remember"
"I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well here I am
It ain't no big surprise
You got a broken heart to kill
Tired of knowing how it feels
When you learn you been living
A lie
Oh, and ain't that a shame
You shouldn't feel such pain
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
So go ahead and take your shot
Drink your whiskey on the rocks
And tell me how
You'll never find the one
But Lord knows it hurts me bad
Every time I see you sad
Knowing that my love
Goes on and on
Oh, it just ain't right
You're alone tonight
But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
You can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside ya
And find the one that's never gonna let you down
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well, here I am
It ain't no big surprise"
"I know a little place we can go
Two rights, a left, a right passed the liquor store
There's a little trail only me I might know
With nothing but tall pines and my hand to hold
[Chorus]
Is where I smoked my first smoke
Drank beer from a can
Kissed the first girl,
Skipped school with my friends
Where I went to turn bad times to good
Come on lay with me, no better place to be
Our little secrets safe in these trees,
'Cause out here baby it's just understood
What happens in the woods, stays in the woods
No city lights, no nine to five tonight
Just you and me kissing while the moon and the stars shine
Yeah dancing in the breeze, maybe drink a little red wine
Roll around in the leaves, from the world we'll hide
[Chorus]
Come on girl, leave your iPhone at home
We're gonna kick it way back
With a blanket and a radio
I know a little place where we could go and lay low
[Chorus]
Come on baby let's go out to the woods."
"How did you find me here
Oh won't you tell me dear
You must have heard my prayer
Did you know that I was wishing
For something that was missing
I turned and you were there
Was it always your intention
Or was it meant to be
Was it divine intervention
That led your heart to me
My angel
My one and only
Never let you go
My angel
You've seen the last of lonely
Baby I know
You're my angel
I swear until this day
I never felt this way
I never thought I could
Oh baby you mean the world to me
And I will always be
Right by your side for good
Just like the waves of the ocean
On a clear blue sea
I feel the sweetest emotion
Oh - washing over me
My angel
My one and only
Never let you go
My angel
You've seen the last of lonely
Baby I know
You're my angel
Was it always your intention
Or was it meant to be
Was it divine intervention
That led your heart to me
My angel
My one and only
Never let you go
My angel
You've seen the last of lonely
Baby I know
You're my angel"
"I still see my brother Michael,
Pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry
I kept all my brother?s letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head
His words said ?Not to worry, doing fine?
It was his way of trying to ease my mind
While I was trying not to read between the lines
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world
Then it was football games and homecoming and
Picking out our dresses for the prom
With my brother in some desert dodging bullets when he wasn?t dodging bombs
While we went from the land of brave and free
To just being afraid to disagree
While I was being brought down to my knees by
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn?t seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world
It was the middle of December when the Army sent my brother home at last
While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground
The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much was lost, so much was missed
It doesn?t seem fair that any boy or any girl
Should have to carry the weight of the world"
"Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
It's in with the new and it's out with the old.
Out goes the warm and in comes the cold.
It's the most predictable story told.
In with the young and out with the old.
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
A belly full of high dollar wine.
A fat hand, a fat wallet, too.
Things change and get strange with this movement of time.
It's happening, right now to you.
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
It's a real bad time to bring up the truth
Tho we searched we found no fountain of youth
Not in Spain nowhere near, anywhere close to here
There's nothing good because nothing lasts
And all that comes here, it comes here to pass.
I would voice my pain, but the change wouldn't last.
All that comes, it comes here to pass.
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well and ruins my mind.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
I get took for a ride every time.
Down with the glistening shine.
Down with the glistening shine.
Down with the glistening shine."
"He said settle down cowgirl
Let me tell how its gonna be
You and me, leave that suitcase packed for the sorrow
I'ma take you home to Tennessee to your family
Said my chariot awaits to carry me out of these gates
Of this prison we been living to long
[Chorus]
Just bring love, thats all your gonna need
Bring love, bring your love to me
I said lookey here cowboy
I always got a lot to say
And then I said, OK
We set our sights on the brightest star
Left L.A. headed east across New Mexico
And took it slow
Dust the paths of my past of life don't live to fast
I'll be going with my Joe lead the way
[Chorus]
He said settle down cowgirl
Let me tell how its gonna be
You and me, as the sun set behind us in Jackson
Two well traveled souls headed home
Back home, I said tell me again what I need to begin
To live a life in the light of your love
[Chorus: x2]
Bring love, thats all your gonna need"
"Billy-Ray was a Preacher's son,
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along,
When they gathered round and started talking,
Cousin Billy would take me walking,
Through the back yard we'd go walking,
Then he'd look into my eyes,
Lord knows to my surprise:
The only one who could ever reach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.
Being good isn't always easy,
No matter how hard I tried,
When he started sweet talking to me,
he'd come tell me everything is alright,
he'd kiss and tell me everything is alright,
Can I get away again tonight?.
The only one who could ever reach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was.
How well I remember,
The look that was in his eyes,
Stealing kisses from me on the sly,
Taking time to make time,
Telling me that he's all mine,
Learning from each others knowing,
Looking to see how much we'd grown.
The only one who could ever reach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
The only boy who could ever teach me,
Was the son of a preacher man,
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was."
"I found it in a pawn shop in a ragged cardboard case
With the guns and dusty watches it looked so out of place
With a Trailways baggage sticker yellow frayed and torn
Destination Nashville Septemper '64
[Chorus]
And you could tell by the fingerboard her painted nails were long
She only needed three cords to play those good ole country songs
And her name's etched in the finish like a fading battle scar
And this 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
I wonder if she played it in a small town talent show
With her hair teased to perfection in a dress her mama sewed
And for a little inspiration she pasted on a star
Here up on the head stock of Emma Jean's guitar
[Chorus]
Doooooo doooo
I wouldn't even know her if I saw her face to face
But there's a little bit of Emma Jean in every song I play
She passed along these hopes and dreams cradled in my arms
And I am just a guardian of Emma Jean's guitar
[Chorus]
This 1950 Gibson was Emma Jean's guitar
Doooo dooo doooo doo ooooooo"
"Since the day I was born my mother used to say,
I pity the man that will carry you away,
I never knew exactly why it's something that builds up inside,
Yeah I'm a hillbilly pickin' ramblin' girl,
And I'm hangin' in bars and I'm listening to Merle,
Drinkin' whiskey and beer to wash this pain away singing good old country songs
not the ones they play today,
Hey hey,
Hey hey,
No I can't settle down,
I'm movin' way to fast,
And yesterday is another day that's past,
I never knew exactly why it's something that builds up inside,
Yeah I'm a hillbilly pickin' ramblin' girl,
And I'm hangin' in bars and I'm listening to Merle,
Drinkin' whiskey and beer to wash this pain away singing good old country songs
not the ones they play today,
Hey hey,
Hey hey,
Yeah I'm a hillbilly pickin' ramblin' girl,
And I'm hangin' in bars and I'm listening to Merle,
Drinkin' whiskey and beer to wash this pain away singing good old country songs

"We were waltzing together to a dreamy melody
When they called out change partners, and you waltzed away from me
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze upon the floor
And I'll keep on changing partners till I hold you once more
Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment something happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners till you're in my arms and then
Oh, my darlin', I will never change partners again"
"I have seen your soul turn black
And then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette
And wash your bloodied feet
You have heard the silent running
Of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss
That I will feel forever
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
WG did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In tha hour of gold, the hour oi lead
I have watched you riding on
The wall of death
And when il finally breaks you and you fall
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me
To bind the fatal wound
And catch your last sweet breath
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
But the world will be my witness when
They excavate my heart
And find the image of your face
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin
That neither time Nor tundra could erase
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead"
"She ...
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten
By everyone
And she ...
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big ol' field was her backyard
In the delta sun
Oh, but she sure could sing
Yes, yes
She sure could sing
Then he ...
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He help her some
And he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one
Oh, but she sure could sing
My, my she sure could sing
She had faith and she had believin'
She led all the people together in singin'
And she prayed very night
To the Lord up above
Singin' hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
They ...
Would walk singin' songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she
Never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day
Oh, but she sure could sing
Yes, yes she sure could sing"
"I have met the Master on my knees been tested and I've tried
And I've seen the God of heaven paint the fields and the country side
I've been the husband of one wife heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
I'm just a plain hard working man no stopping place have I found
Although I'm tired I'm still inspired at night when I lie down
I've learned to like it on God's earth but I sometimes I wonder why
When I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die
When I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"Je peux gravir pour toi les sommets de l'ivresse
Et ramper en silence dans les tranch?es de boue
Aussi longtemps que Mona Lisa peut garder son sourire de caresse
Je peux prendre les armes et les rendre au centuple
S?cher les larmes et saluer l'horizon
Et je veux te saisir sans jamais ?pingler le papillon
Je t'aime, mais je ne te tiens pas
Dans le creux de ma main
Dans le creux de ma main
Dans les hivers de glace et les ?t?s de feu
Dans les jours de p?ril et les longues nuit de gr?ce
A la gloire de l'?treinte et au cul de la pens?e ?troite et restreinte

Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main

Reste encore
Une lueur dans la nu?e
On les connait les porcs, les cafards et d?lateurs
Ap?tres cyniques et rampants serviteurs
Ceux qui devant donc, qui ont le sarcasme qui gicle ?pars encore
Que plus jamais personne ne nous oblige ? vivre
En mettant dos ? dos spirituels et sensuels
Et que la porte d'or s'ouvre enfin sur un ciel d'infini

"There's just one place for me near you it's like heaven to be near you
Times when we're apart I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray more than just two lips away
If my time could be spent near you I'd be more than content near you
Make my life worthwhile by telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Times when we're apart..."
"It's good to hear your voice after all this time
I've been told I'm hard to find
It's raining here but I'm keeping dry
And for me that's doing good
To tell the truth there ain't much to know
I've dealt some cards and I've rodeo'd
But I haven't found that pot of gold
Like I said I would
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain
I spent last month in Santa Fe
I heard your daddy passed away
And I should've called your momma
To say how sorry that I am
Well, I don't think I'll be coming back
Spent too long, so I guess that's that
It's nice to know that you still ask about me now and then
Between the high lines and the fence posts
The interstate and the dirt roads
No matter how the wind blows I hear your name
Out of all the things I've done that I regret
There's only one I'd like to change
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain
Out here, between the rainbows and the rain"
"He came speeding through the town each day at sundown
And his car was painted candy apple red
He was coming there to see the sheriff's daughter
And the sheriff didn't know it so they said
Time and time again the sheriff tried to catch him
But he always speeded up and got away
That old county jail stood patiently a waiting
And the sheriff vowed he'd put him there some day
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red
So the sheriff built a barricade to catch him
And he sat there at the limits of the town
But the sheriff's daughter had already net him
And he married him before the sun went down
When the sheriff saw his comin' down the highway
He saw they couldn't stop and quickly caught his breath
As they crashed the barricade the car exploded
And the boy and girl went to a flaming death
Well there goes candy apple red that's what the people said
If he doesn't slow it down a bit he's gonna end up dead
And the sheriff's daughter said she'd rather end up dead
Than to live without her candy apple red"

A new world in the morning so they say
I myself don't talk about a new world in the morning
A new world in the morning that's today
And I can feel a new tomorrow coming on
And I don't know why I have to make a song
Everybody talks a bout a new world in the morning
New world in the morning takes so long
I met a man who had a dream he had since he was twenty
I met that man when he was eighty-one
He said too many folks just stand and wait up till the morning
Don't they know tomorrow never comes
And he would feel a new tomorrow coming on
And when he'd smile his eyes would twinkle up in fun
Everybody talks about a new world in the morning
New world in the morning never comes"
"There were forty little houses
In a place
They called High River
And everyone knew Tim
Since the day he was born
He was a little different
Some might call it slow
But when Nellie moved to town
She saw his heart of gold
They found each other
And never spent
Another day apart
Whoever would have dreamed
In his quiet eyes
She'd find the piece
To make her life complete
Oh you could say
It was a work of art
Like someone took a brush
And painted there hearts
Together they made
Such a beautiful thing
And oh if there was anything
That they could do right
It was painting love
In the perfect light
So we could see
That love is a masterpiece
Yeah
Well Tim always
Had a little trouble
With letters and numbers
So Nellie paid the bills
And read all the mail
No one worked harder
For miles around
Tim was the best farmhand
And Nellie was proud
A year went by of saving
Their nickels and dimes
They had a little boy
They named him Daniel
And he became
Their pride and joy
Oh you could say
It was a work of art
Like someone took a brush
And painted there hearts
Together they made
Such a beautiful thing
And oh if there was anything
That they could do right
It was painting love
In the perfect light
So we could see that
Love is a masterpiece
Everybody said that
They were so
Close to heaven
That they didn't
Have far to go
Somehow it all made sense
That they all went together
That night on that dark road
Oh you could say
It was a work of art
Like someone took a brush
And painted their hearts
Together they made
Such a beautiful thing
And oh if there was anything
That they could do right
It was painting love
In the perfect light
So we could see
That love is a masterpiece
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love is a masterpiece
Yeah
Love is a masterpiece
Love is a masterpiece

"I never had a pair of shoes that weren't all hand-me-downs
And daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
My mama wore no jewelry or any store bought stuff
And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
'Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tobacco, grandma had her snuff
Then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Poplar Bluff"
"Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go

"Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like ""ain't she beautiful?""

You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like ""ain't she beautiful?""
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'

But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go

I look like James Mason's ghost
Talking to a friend after school but you don't see

Dolores was her middle name
And now her mother's wondering
If I could see my wrinkled face
Paint her lovely toenails red

Talking to me like I'm just a little late
Now you know just what he's talking about

What's on your mind I'd like to know
Your coming here just isn't right
You didn't stop to say hello
Is she walking out on you
Or did you choose to let her go
There must be something on your mind
You didn't stop to say hello
Well, come on in, close the door
Don't stand there trembling in the cold
You'll have the neighbors talking more
I'd better turn the lights down low
And go ahead and shed a tear
Don't be afraid to let it show
You know I'll always landed near
You didn't stop to say hello
What's a matter, can't you see?
For you haven't said one single word
You look so tired and so weak
Things must be worse than what I've heard
Oh, I guess it's useless to pretend
Because you know I love you so
You know you're welcome back again
I'm glad you stopped to say hello"
"Hold on honey, there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Are you born yet? Are you listening?
Are you sick of staring at the walls?
Are you hungry? Are you angry?
Are you wondering if there's anyone at all?
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you weary? Are you sinking?
Are you tired of holding up the walls?
Are you done with all your thinking?
Have you found that there's no one at all?
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Ain't got no answers here
What I see is not clear
Time to shake it around
Turn my world upside down
and watch as the stars come unhinged
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep you away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Hold on honey there's a new dawn coming
and a big bird to sweep us away
Keep on dreaming soon there'll be a reason
to see it through one more day
Are you born yet?
Are you born yet?"
"Good mornin' mornin' glory
Good mornin' what's your story
Good mornin' where'd you spend the night
Where did your night dreams take you
Sorry but I had to wake you
Oh I just had to make you
Shed your precious mornin' light on me
Oh good mornin' sleepy baby
You know, I'm thinking maybe
I love you even more today
Every time you go to sleep
I'm jealous of the dreams
That keep you away from me
Good mornin' mornin' glory
I'll have to thank the sandman
For he's let you wake up in my arms again
Doo doo da doo doo doo doo"
"I never thought I'd need you
But now I find I'm wrong
Come on back, sweet mama
Back where you belong
I've rambled over town
To find that I can't win
Come on back and pick me up again
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the time
Of all the other gals I've known
There's none to take your place
'Cause when I get into a jam
They just ain't in the race
So, now that you're back here
Let's take another round
With you here by my side
Babe, the deal just can't go down
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the time
Now, if I lose
(If I lose)
Let me lose
(Let me lose)
I don't care
(I don't care)
How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While I'm tryin' to win a dime?
My baby, she's got money all the time"
"As I look at the letter that you wrote to me it's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love
I think of the past and all the pleasures we've had as I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more"
"I will wake up tomorrow
I have tended to God's small song
And to Love's small song
And closed my eyes to sleep so long
And tonight I'll go
Into all of the places that you love
That is my place here
To have been in those
I will wake up tomorrow
I have amended some of the things
That some actions bring
And closed the head to be with you
In each eye there is an apple
Buried there before the eye
And out of sockets come the branches
And from the branches dangle I"
"(Goodbye sunshine)
Goodbye sunshine gee but I'll miss your smile
Don't cry sunshine I'll be back in a while
And when I'm lonesome and the lonely tears start
I'll think of you and there'll be bluebirds in my heart
Keep those blue eyes full of love just for me
And there'll be blue skies anyplace I may be
And don't you worry everything will be fine I'll walk the line
Here comes the train kiss me again goodbye sunshine
(Goodbye sunshine)
Keep those blue eyes full of love...
Goodbye sunshine (goodbye)"
"She's got three kids, no husband
She's two weeks late on last month's rent
She's waitin' on the child support
He keeps swearin' that it's coming
But if she knows him, she knows where it went
And that pile o' bills ain't gonna pay themselves
It's been a forty-hour week and it's only Tuesday
And there's homework and dinner to make
Somebody wants a lullaby
Somebody wants a different channel
Somebody's dealin' with their first heartbreak
And the dishes in the sink ain't gonna wash themselves
She lights a cigarette out on the balcony
When she gets a couple minutes to herself
There's how you plan it out, and how it turns out to be
And a broken home, it ain't no fairytale
She's got three kids, no husband
And a hairnet job at a diner down on Main
She knows damn well
She don't make the best cup o' coffee
But she's quick with a smile and good with names
Those lunch tickets ain't gonna tip themselves
She smokes a cigarette out by the loading dock
And tries not to pick the polish off her nails
She thinks about a guy who's been coming in a lot
She starts to dream and then she stops herself
She's got three kids, no husband
So she's a mom and a dad and a taxi driver
When the baby's sick, she's an up-all-nighter
A hand and a shoulder and a referee
A real-life hero if you ask me
'Cause those kids ain't gonna raise themselves"
"That's The Way
I sit here in my bed, with you in my head, haunting my mind
I think of all we had, all the good and bad and all of the times
We'd sit down and talk, sometimes till three or four o'clock in the morning
I live in misery, haunted by your memory, and the love that I felt
Guess that was not enough, you fell out of love, something you couldn't help
I guess now I see; that's the way it's gotta be
Chorus:
Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be
We run around these streets, looking for company, someone to hold
At the end of the night, we give up our fights, and go home alone
We give up on love, and we say we've had enough of the game
Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be
We walk around in circles, were all just jumping hurdles, just trying to get by
We take life in stride, and swallow our pride, all to survive
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be
Fates got a plan for us, even when our lives get rough
You make up, break up, you fall, you get back up
Can't you see; that's the way it's gotta be"
"That midnight tram is a long and a slow one
The timetable's set, the brakernan is tired
Your seat is reserved with exceptions for no one
No luggage allowed, no ticket required
It will be there right on time at the station
Even if midnight must come at high noon
And you will not know that tram's destination
And you'll not leave late nor one minute too soon
You may sit beside fear and go worse than lonely
Or travel with trust and love and faith restored
These choices you have and these choices only
When that tram rolls in and you step on board
Now that whistle blows, yes it's already whimn'
If you listen close, you can hear it soft and clear
And that headlight burns, yes it's already shimn'
You might as well choose right now, it's love or fear
It's love or fear"
"Another party's over another night with friends
Their laughter's cold and left alone and now my mem'ries begin
I beg of you my darling and pass the hours away
These mem'ries of mine like reddest wine
Grow stronger with each passing day
Ours was a special love and once in a lifetime love
That's what I'd rather dream of
The past with you than search for someone new
Life without you is empty like the seasons without the fall
But I'd rather have loved and lost you than never have loved you at all
But I'd rather have loved and lost you than never have loved you at all"
"If I knew what made the world go round or made the raindrops tumble down
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the flowers bloom or made the Man up in the Moon
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the blue blue sky if I knew what made the robin fly
If I knew what made the chill of morning dew
If I knew what made the river flow if I knew what made the north wind blow
Then I'd know why I love you
If I knew what made the blue blue sky
Then I'd know why I love you"
"If you ask me if I'm happy
For I have peace within
If I'm worried about tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end
I'm satisfied with my Jesus
When he knocks I let him in
He'll go with me through the valley
For I know he is my friend
[Chorus:]
Satisfied, Satisfied
No trouble can ever get me down
When my eyes shall close in death
With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied
When my friends all forsake me
When they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow
It won't matter over yonder
When I reach the other side
I'm gonna sit down with my Jesus
And then you'll know I'm satisfied"
"Spare In The Trunk (Chris Jonat)
Undone, undone, I cried through clenched teeth
I was aiming for drama, I was comic relief
Undone indeed you cooed, as you put me to bed
The words sure were silly, but it's cute they were said
Though you are younger, you know what you're doing
You push to the edge, pull back from the ruin
Tho I am older I am not so brave
I long to bewilder, I tend to behave
I know that you think that I think that you know
My love's like spare in the trunk
I know what you think but I think you should know
I love like down the stairs drunk"
"Let me whisper darling one more time let the soft curves of your body cling to mine
Let me feel you through and through I can't get enough of you
Let me whisper darling oner more time
Everytime I hold you it gets harder to let you go and get you off my mind
Stay with me and let me take you farther and higher than you've ever dared to climb
And I know you've got somebody else and I know you've got to go but before you do
Let me whisper darling...
The night's almost over but I'm not ready to let you go
Please let me whisper darling one more time"
"Everybody knows that
I've had my share of fair weather lovers
They always leave just ahead of the rain
Searching for sunshine and looking for pleasure
Two steps ahead of the last hurricane
If this is a chance then I'm gonna take it
Heaven knows I've taking chances before
It's hard to live with your eyes on the sparrow
Unless you first take your feet off the shore
There's not a cloud up in the sky
Give me one good reason why
We should set our sails for somewhere
Other that the sunny side of nowhere
Freedom's in the eagles wings, baby
Listen to those seagulls sing, maybe
Love is just a porpoise
Playing in the tropical sun
Let me tell you girl
That ocean get big when your
Halfway across it
And this ship of love's seen a lot of bad days
Sometimes it's harder to row with the current
Most of my life I've just rocked on the waves
If this is a game then I'm gonna play it
I need your love like those sails need wind
Just climb aboard, girl, and pull up the anchor
Now is the time for our love to begin
Woo, there's not a cloud up in the sky
Not a cloud up in the sky
Not a cloud up in the sky
Give me one good reason why
It's a fairy tale morning"
"Bobby Bare
Willie Jones was a man I met when I lived in Baltimore
I was a guard and he was doing time
In the three long years he stayed there I got to know him well
Willie Jones he was a friend of mine
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more
He talked about the whippoorwills in the Alabama night
Honeysuckle vine and sugar cane
Swimming holes and fishing poles and early morning frost
And sleeping under a tin roof when it rained
He talked about a country road and a cabin in the pines
And a girl with wavy long chestnut brown hair
He talked about the beauty of his Blue Ridge Mountain home
And darn near made me think that I was there
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
When a man ain't got no freedom the time sure passes slow
Willie Jones had ten long years to go
It's been almost a years now since that hot night in July
Willie hit the guard and jumped the fence
I had my rifle ready but I couldn't let it fly
I shot over his head and we ain't seen him since
Then last week the postman brought a letter to my door
Marked No Return Address and No Reply
It just said nobody north of Birmingham is gonna see this boy again
But if you're ever down our way won't you please drop by
He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more"
"He's taking it hard she's taking it easy
She's living it up and he's living it down
He's walking the floor looking for answers
She's out on the floor all over town
Ain't that the way that love goes when love goes to pieces
Ain't that the truth when you find out you're living a lie
Ain't love the reason we both took a chance on each other
Ain't it each other we both swore we wanted to try
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy
She's drying her eyes but his are still wet
He wishes he could just hold her until she remembers
She wishes she could find someone to make her forget
He's taking it hard she's taking it easy"
"I'm drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
Guilty conscience I guess
I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine
So I'll keep drinking champagne, feeling no pain 'till early morning
Dinning and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning
Knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
Guilty conscience I guess
I must confess
I never loved you much when you were mine"
"The strange lonely whistle of the distant movin' train
Breaks the silence of the gray winter skies
As I walk with my belongings down the road I'd never seen
While the bitter wind brings teardrops to my eyes
Oh where will I be when tomorrow weakens me am I looking for a dream I'll never find
Will I ever be the man I want to be or forgotten footprints in the sands of time
As I'm walking down the road my thoughts keep running back to you
And I hope it's in your heart to understand
Though you never made me sorry for the love I gave to you
I'm just sorry that I'm not your kind of man
Oh where will I be...
[ rh.guitar ]
Oh where will I be..."
"If love was a river
And I was a drowning man
Would you get in the water
Would you lend me a hand
If love was a river
Would you sit on the land
If love was a mountain
High above this town
Would you climb to the top
Would you never look down
If love was a mountain
Would you go around
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a firefly
Sitting in your hand
Would you laugh when it twinkled
Let it go again
If love was a firefly
Would you understand
If love was a party
With everyone you know
Would you dance if I asked you
Would you smile and say no
If love was a party
Would you even go
Love may only knock so many times upon your door
And heaven only knows if it will come back anymore
If love was a fast train on a one-way track
Would you turn in your ticket
Would you never look back
If love was a fast train
Would you even pack?"
"You're out there among the stars
It never will seem right
If I could get to where you are
I'd be there tonight
Were you just a dream I had
How am I to know
I can't hold you in my arms
And I can't let you go
Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
I could climb that jagged peak
I could cross that great divide
If I knew that you'd be waiting
For me on the other side
The days pass by my window now
Oh, but nights like these are rough
I can feel you in my heart
But that's not close enough
If I could hear you breathe again
The comfort of your sigh
I'd gladly trade tomorrow in
On one more last goodbye
Higher mountains
Deeper valleys
Longer rivers
Stand between us now
When I rise above the seas
(When you rise above the earth)
And the Firmaments collide
(And the Firmaments collide)
When I pass through Heaven's gateway
Let me enter as your bride
(Yes you will enter as my bride)
Bluebonnets in my hair
(That I will gather for you there)
That you'll gather for me there
You're out there among the stars"
"A policeman's whistle gayly, a smile upon his face
As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break
Standing bare foot in the middle of the street
I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away
The policeman stopped the traffic, then went up to the boy
And he asked him gently, where do you belong
The little boy stopped crying and with trembling lips he said
I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong
[Chorus:]
The little boy is happy now with a new mom and dad
His new daddy is the policeman on the beat
Tho' he can't forget that awful day it doesn't seem to hurt so bad
He has a brand new pair of shoes upon his feet"
"You Almost Slipped My Mind
She walked right up to me and took me by the hand
An angel who could please most any man
She said to me I'm free and you're just my kind
And for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Almost you almost slipped my mind
I could taste taste her kisses in the wine
But your mem'ry came and found me just in time
But for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Now I can see how sometimes a man can be so blind
Let himself be led astray become the cheating kind
I'd found myself falling for that same old line
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mind
Yes for a moment you almost slipped my mind"
"By David Allan Coe
Dedicated to lovers everywhere. May you always find something in my music to believe in and hold you together.
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE WATCHING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
NOTHING LIKE TURNING THOSE GREY SKIES BLUE
NOTHING LIKE DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE YOU KNOW
THERE'S SO MANY PLACES FOR YOUR HEAD TO GO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY JUST TAKE IT SLOW
NOW'S THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE LIVING ON A SAILBOAT
NOTHING LIKE SETTING YOUR DREAMS AFLOAT
NOTHING LIKE TAKING JUST ONE MORE TOKE
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE
THERE AIN'T NOTHING AS PRETTY AS THE SUN GOING DOWN
NOTHING AS FUNNY AS A CIRCUS CLOWN
NOTHING LIKE RIDING ON A MERRY GO ROUND
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE"
"And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown
Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me
Eternal happiness or woe
What shall my portion be
A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot
And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown"
"If you see a pick-up truck with a plastic 'coon dog,
Mounted on the hood.
If you pass trailer with a concrete donkey in the yard,
An' tires up on the roof.
An' if you see a woman in a moo-moo,
Readin' Tarot cards an' palms down by the road.
That's how you know; that's how you know,
You're in my neighborhood.
In my neighborhood,
There's nothin' ordinary about the regular folk.
In my neighborhood,
We make our own wine outta berries we grow.
A word to the wise, when they turn out the lights,
It's a free-for-all, y'all, every Saturday night,
But everybody treats everybody they way they should,
In my neighborhood.
When the wind is just right, you can tell they're makin' paper,
At the mill on Champion Lane.
When Mabel Johnson goes to fry 'em Rocky Mountain Oysters,
You can smell 'em from a mile away.
You might hear the church bells playin' ""Sweet Home Alabama"",
'Cause the preacher loves rock an' roll,
That's how you know; that's how you know,
You're in my neighborhood.

"You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
I won't be the one you won't keep
I won't be your fool

You say you've got something
That makes you unique
I can tell you I got something
Every little boy needs
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You won't be some dream I'm dreamin'
I'll be wide awake
If I closed my eyes I'd miss it and what a waste
You won't get the better of me I'm the best
If you need a vacation I could do with a rest
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart

Don't hesitate, don't wait it's too late
Just give your heart a break
Be mine, be mine
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
Hearts of gold are hearts to mould
So come and work on me

Keepin' ya shouting about it
You've got a one way ticket into my heart
You've got a one way ticket into my heart"
"WRITERS HANK MILLS, WALTER HAYNESS
When you wake up in the mornin' and you're sick your head to toe
No need to get a doctor cause the doc he won't know
How to take away the hurtin' that's been a tossin' you around
You say the blues ain't nothin' but a woman let no good man down
Hit your finger with a hammer and the pain ain't the same
There ain't nothin' like a woman to drive a good man insane
She's gonna keepin' you in mis'ry like a flee on a hound
Cause the blues ain't nothin' but a woman let no good man down
[ guitar - piano ]
When you been out a walkin' in the drizzlin' rain
You gonna hear everybody callin' out her name
Go find yourself a river jump in and drown
Cause the blues ain't nothin' but a woman let no good man down"
"I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor,
Like an outlaws boys on the day before.
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for.
Doin' my thing singing my song,
Right on track I'm chugging along.
I'm here and gone like yesterday,
Rolling like an old freight train.
On a wing and a prayer in a glorified greyhound bus,
Flying down the road running 9-0 and kicking up dust.
Drinkin' truck stop coffee
Countin' birds on those telephone wires.
Burnin' the midnight oil
And the tread off these Old Goodyear tires.
I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor,
Like an outlaws boys on the day before.
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give em all what they came here for.
Doin' my thing singing my song,
Right on track I'm chugging along.
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train.
And sometimes my mind is a million miles away,
I know you're sound asleep at home while I'm on this stage.
And I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you everyday.
But girl I gotta keep rollin',
Rollin' like an old freight train.
And it's a mighty lonesome sound
When there's not soul around
To help you ease your pain,
But you gotta keep rollin'.
Rollin' like an old freight train.
I'm gonna give 'em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor,
Like an outlaws boys on the day before.
Got the pretty girls out there begging for more,
Gotta give 'em all what they came here for.
Doin' my thing singing my song,
Right on track I'm chugging along.
I'm here and gone like yesterday,
Rolling like an old freight train,
Comin' on down the line
Feel that diesel engine whine
Smell the smoke stack, hear the gears grind
Full steam ahead halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back going
Clickity clack down the railroad tracks.
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train
Just like an old freight train.
Tell me do you wanna ride this train."
"Sometimes Momma it can feel real heavy
When I think of the wrong I have done
I don't know how I can carry this burden
All I feel is the weight of the gun
The weight of the gun
And the wrong I have done
I know this wasn't what you planned for me
Mothers have hopes for their sons
Along with the shame I have brought to the family
All I feel is the weight of the gun
The weight of the gun
And the wrong I have done
My hands are empty but my mind is filled
With things that cannot be undone
How many years since I've lifted a pistol?
But I still feel the weight of the gun
The weight of the gun
Things that can't be undone
The weight of the gun
And the wrong I have done
Well brass is heavy, steel is heavy,
Lead even heavier still
Heaviest of all is the weight on your soul
From the blood of the man you've killed
A concrete cell is especially tough
On a boy used to Montana sun
And the news that you're gone that the warden delivered
Makes me long for the weight of the gun
The weight of the gun
The Montana sun
The weight of the gun
And the wrong I have done
Well brass is heavy, steel is heavy,
Lead even heavier still
Heaviest of all is the weight on your soul
From the blood of the man you've killed"
"When the letter came this morning
Happy teardrops filled my eyes
It had a picture of a smiling face
And a ticket tucked inside
He didn't have to write one word
I understood it all
The picture said, ""I love you""
And the ticket said, ""Come home""
Well, the big ole wheels
Are turning as we roll on down the line
""Hey there, big conductor
Won't you get me there on time?""
The Kudzu vines are winding
Up the trees beside the road
The grass is getting greener
So we must be getting close
There he stands a-waiting
As the train pulls to the gate
There's so many things to ask him
But they're gonna have to wait
With cap in hand he stands there
Every hair is combed in place
His shiny boots reflecting
The big smile on his face
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Arm in arm he leads me
To his buckboard by the tree
Hand in hand we ride
To the house he built for me
He picks me up and gently
Carries me through the cabin door
Goodbye lonely hearts club
I don't need you anymore
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?
You've made me happier
Than I've ever been
For the price of a letter
And one old faded picture
You've helped me
Find myself to love a man
Lonely hearts club tell me
Why do they call you lonely?"
"In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities all the nations
Everything that falls your way
There is a deeper wave than this
That you don't understand
There is a deeper wave than this
Tugging at your hand
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see
There is a deeper wave than this
Swelling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
Feel it rising in the cities
Feel it sweeping over land
Over borders, over frontiers
Nothing will its power withstand
There is no deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is no deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
All the bloodshed, all the anger
All the weapons, all the greed
All the armies, all the missiles
All the symbols of our fear
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
At the still point of destruction
At the center of the fury
All the angels, all the devils
All around us, can't you see
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand
I say love is the seventh wave"
"(Tom Slocum)
Gliding bird gliding through the sky
I'm wondering why I can't be why I can't be as free
Gliding bird gliding all day long
Sing your secret song away from all these faces that I see
Is where I want to be
My feet are so tired
They walked too many miles
If I run so wild like heaven's child
I'll learn to fly someday
Gliding bird riding in the sun
Rainbow colors run
I hear the wind
I hear its mournful call"
"Shame on me for hurting you what can I say what can I do
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me
You say you won't be seein' me again you say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow if I knew that to be true
I know that just sayin' sorry doesn't sound out a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night means no more to me
Than the thousand stars to the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at her the more I realize how much I love you
Shame on me for hurting you...
I'll admit I shouldn't have given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for I was blind and I hurt you
Can you ever forgive the fool the fool who really loves you
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me"
"This world's enought to break a man's heart
Make him question who's in charge
And then you ask me to believe
What I can't see
My T.V. sold me some sin
Said anything goes, so I bought in
I've tried it all a time or two
Didn't have much use for you
I've said your name in vain before
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
She lays out the Sunday clothes I wear
Without her I ain't got a prayer
God you got you a good one there
Shinin' your light
And I'm no expert on the word
I can't quote you chapter and verse
But I've heard you love the worst of ones too
And I'm the proof
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
I've let the devil drive my Ford
Read Jesus save on a bathroom door
Just before I passed out
How come you didn't strick me dead
Sent me and angel insted
She sing in the choir
And I'm hell on the preacher
But God you got you one more believer
Oh God you got you one more believer"
"A REAL CLOSE FRIEND
(George Jones - George Riddle)
'63 Glad Music
(I think you know a real close friend of mine)
The girl that you described sounds so familiar
The one you say you've loved for quite some time
Are you sure there's no mistake for I have a feeling
That your real love's a real close friend of mine
Well I am glad we've had this little talk together
For at last I began to see the light
I've been spending many lonely nights here lately
All because of that real close friend of mine
(I think you know a real close friend of mine)
Well I'll bet she says each day her love grows stronger
And if you left she'd surely lose her mind
And if she ever makes you feel unwanted
Then I think you know a real close friend of mine
Yes I am glad we've had this little talk together...
All because of a real close friend of mine"

"When I think about the time that I sat crying in my beer
Jukebox pounding misery from ear to ear
I know I'd tell myself I'm better off without you here
But I'm looking for beginnings when the end is always near
She's leavin' in the morning sing a sad song for me
Keeping me in the dark don't know how long it will be
But I've heard that tune before she says she's gotta be free
But I know that's not true and that's what's bothering me
Anywhere you look it's everywhere and all around
It's the blues they keep singing lord and it's bound to get you down
But the melody can move you in a way to ease the pain
And it won't be long before you're on your feet again
I'd be alright if she'd just make up her mind
I don't know why but I forgive her time after time"
"My love swears that he is made of truth
I do believe him though I know he lies
I've caught him creeping 'round darkened holes
I've caught him staring at distant skies
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the notes fall slow
Slow
My love lives inside a haze of gloom
He fears today, what might come tomorrow
Seeks the shadow, shuns the light
Bleeds for knowledge, prepares for sorrow
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the note fall slow
Slow
This ain't no depression, just notes falling slow
An early snow and notes falling slow
Do I have the strength to bear their passion?
An early snow and notes falling slow"
"Yesterday morning, just before noon
I passed a girl wearing your old perfume
And I stopped and stared
I could almost see you standing there
Don't get me wrong, I'm almost over you
But now and then I like to go walking through
Some of our old times
Even though I realize
I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
And I'll find another love
But there will never be another you
Night after night, I go back through the years
I sit on this porch as the sun disappears
Like we did back then
I remind myself once again
That I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life
Just like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there will never be another you
Well, I guess I should thank you
For showing me how love should feel
I know what I'm gonna look for
'Cause I felt it when you held me
And I'll have another chance
I'll find another girl
I'll see another day
And I'll build another world
I'll start another life just
Like you told me to
I'll find another love
But there'll never be another you
Another you"

Have you ever loved someone just as I love you
Can't you see that I'm sorry for each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed dear can't you see I've paid
Be a little forgiving and take me back in your heart
How can I go on living now that we're apart
If you knew what I've been through you then you'd know why I ask you
Have you ever been lonely have you ever been blue

Forever in her eyes staring back at me

And I've got all I need
And it's alright by me

Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you
It may be a simple life, but that's okay
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

For giving me everything I ever could dream of

"I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
""How sweetly I sleep here alone.
The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar,
And gathering storms may arise,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul.
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.
The cause of my Master compelled me from home,
No kindred or relative nigh.
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
My soul flew to mansions on high.
Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The same hand that led me through scenes most severe
Has kindly assisted me home."""
"Love is a question that few understand
It runs like a river between a woman and man
But it's course can get twisted
It's bed can run dry
And a heart become desert in the wink of an eye
Once there was loving once there was trust
Once it was honest and open and just
Our love was a diamond that grew between us
But time can turn even diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust oh diamonds to dust
Time can turn even diamonds to dust
Uh huh uh huh
Time is a teacher it's kind and it's cruel
It gives you the wisdom to see you're a fool
And it gives love and takes love
It hurts and it heals
And it never parts easy with the truth it reveals
Diamonds to dust oh diamonds to dust
Time can turn even diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust oh diamonds to dust
Time can turn even diamonds to dust
Uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh"

"Well, I woke one morning, found you staring down at me
You said ""I'll take my share now, father please""
And you took your money and you took your leave
You drilled my heart and turned your back on me
And you hit the town and you hit the bottle hard
You race 'round in your fancy cars and you blow all your money
On brothels, beds, and bars
Before you know your broken times get hard
I still stand here waiting with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been, so please come home
And now you've hit bottom, all those open doors have shut
And you're hungry stomach's tied in knots
But I know what you're thinking, that you troubled me enough
Nothing could ever separate you from my love
I still stand here waiting, with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been
Yes and I'll be right here waiting, 'til you come around the bend
And I run to you and hold you close, won't let go again
So please come home, please come home
Don't you know son that I love you?
And I don't care where you've been, so please come home"
"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixon
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!""

Your arms stretched out and open wide.
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow
Your blood flows down to me somehow.
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.

Praise to the Father who gave His son away
The proof of love, the price of grace
You traded all to take my place
And died for me so I can be a child of God"

In the great unknown,
I'll remember you.
I'll remember you
At the end of the trail,
I had so much left to do,
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget,

One time or two.

And I'm in the shade,
I'll remember you.
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to.
In the end,
My dear sweet friend,
I'll remember you"
"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowin' mountains to the south bells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's the combination of the Wabash Cannonball

As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear that lonesome hoboes call
You're trav'ling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

As she rolled into the station you could hear the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

"One night when I was out ridin'
The graveyard shift, midnight till dawn
The moon was bright, as a readin' light
With a letter from an old friend back home
And he asked me, ""Why do you ride for your money? Tell me, why do you rope for short pay?
You ain't a gettin' nowhere and you're losin' your share.
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there.""
He said, ""Last night, I ran on to Jenny. She's married and she has a good life.
Boy, you sure missed the track, when you never came back.
She's the perfect professional's wife.
And she asked me, 'Why does he ride for his money? Tell me, why does he rope for short pay?
He ain't a gettin' nowhere, and he's losin' his share.
Boy, he must have gone crazy out there.' ""
Ah, but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They've never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring at the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole Camp Cookie sing
So I read up the last of my letter
And I tore off the stamp for Black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned
And he said, ""Now why do they ride for their money? Tell me, why do they ride for short pay?
They ain't a gettin' nowhere and they're losin' their share
Boy, they must have gone crazy out there
Son, they all must be crazy out there."""

"IN CASE YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
(I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
In case you ever change your mind)
She came down from the mansion on the mountain
She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
(In case you ever change your mind)
Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind...
Just in case you ever change your mind"
"He's got a way of walking he's got a way of talking
A way to fascinate me all the time
And he's got a way with women a way to keep my head a swimming
He's got a way too many times
Oh speaking of the devil well here he comes now
Looking like an angel got my defenses down
He's got me dreaming got me scheming
Ooh speaking of the devil he is driving me wild
With that wicked little grin and that fire in his eyes
He's got me dreaming got me scheming
Ooh speaking of the devil it feels mighty close to heaven
And I'd go through hell to make him mine
He's got his spell upon me got to be his one and only
Burning with passion and desire
Ooh I'm caught up in all his magic it surely would be tragic
To never share the heat in all his fire
Ooh speaking of the devil well here he comes now...
[ guitar ]
Ooh speaking of the devil well here he comes now..."
"Sometimes you may think I take you for granted
And granted, sometimes maybe I do
'Cause I've grown so used to you lying next to me
That I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
[Chorus]
No I wouldn't want to get up in the morning if you weren't there
To kiss me and start my day off right
And to be waiting when I get home with loving just for me
No I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
It's love that makes the world go round
And my love for you just grows with leaps and bounds
'Cause you know just what to do when the world has turned all blue
And I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me"
"Don't be concerned it's time I learned
That those who play with fire get burned
But I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
Don't be too quick to pity me
Don't salve my heart with sympathy
'Cause I'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
The world looks on with wonder
And pity at your kind
'Cause it knows that the future
Is not very pretty for your kind for your kind
Will always be runnin' and wonderin'
What's happened to hearts that you've broken
And left all alone
But we'll be alright in a little while
But you'll be permanently lonely
Runnin' lonely"
"You said let's go away
And leave our worries behind us
You took me from my sorrow
And you treat me with kindness
Because I wanna be the one
Always by your side
And I'll pray the truth won't stay
But I'm always reminded
'Cause darlin' just between you and me
There is the man who gave you that ring
Just between you and me
There's a house and a baby
And they need
The love you've been giving to me
Yes all that's just between you and me
Today we took a train
And left our worries behind us
We held each other close
And our true love sweet blindness
'Cause I wanna be the one
Always by your side
I pray that you stay away
But I know they're gonna find out
'Cause darlin' just between me and you
There's the woman you gave your ring to
Just between me and you
There's a baby so blue
And he needs
The love I've been giving to you
But all that's just between
Yes all that's just between me and you"
"She's wheeled into the hallway
Till the sun moves down the floor
Little squares of daylight
Like a hundred times before
She's taken to the garden
For the later afternoon
Just before her dinner
They return her to her room
CHORUS:
And inside her mind
She is running
She is running in the summer wind
Inside her mind
She is running in the summer wind
Like a child again
The family comes on Sunday
And they hover for awhile
They fill her room with chatter
And they form a line of smiles
Children of her children
Bringing babies of their own
Sometimes she remembers
Then her mama calls her home
CHORUS
Playmate, come out and play with me
(It's raining, it's poring, the old man is snoring)
And bring your dollies three
(Bumped his head on the edge of the bed)
Climb up my apple tree
(Never got up in the morning)
Slide down my rain barrel
(Rain, rain, go away)
Into my cellar door
(Come again another day)
And we'll be jolly friends
(Little Johnny wants to play)
Forevermore
(Some more)
And inside her mind
She is running
She is running in the summer wind
Like a child again"
"His boots are old and tattered
His Stetson has seen it's better days
His hands are rough and calloused
And what's left of his hair is turning gray
He ain't as tall and handsome
As cowboys up on the movie screen or in a magazine
He ain't no coke a cola cowboy
He's the real thing
He rides across the Prairie
Out where the wild wind blows
And he still works his cattle
Just like a hundred years ago
Sittin' tall in the saddle
Lord, he feels just like a king
Mm, he ain't no Coca Cola cowboy
He's the real thing
There's a woman that loves him
And she knows what real love's all about
She's cooked his meals, washed his clothes
And raised the kids and learned to go without
And if she could do it over
Heavens knows she wouldn't change a thing, not a sing thing
Her her knight in shining armor and she loves him
'Cause he's the real thing
He rides across the Prairie
Out where the wild wind blows
And he still works his cattle
Just like a hundred years ago
Sittin' tall in the saddle
Lord, he feels just like a king
Mm, he ain't no Coca Cola cowboy
He's the real thing
Naw he ain't no rhinestone cowboy
He's the real thing"
"Get ups, gimmicks, one hit wonders that don't stick
Pretty boys, acting tough, boy bands give it up
And if it looks good on TV, it'll look good on a CD
Shape it up, trim it down, who gives a damn 'bout how it sounds
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
You say you're the real deal
But you play what nobody feels
You sing about Johnny Cash
The man in black would've whipped your ass
I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but boys come on let's get real
You still got a lotta boot left to fill
So, so long 'til I see you again
When you're laying in the bargain bin
Well, I don't think Waylon done it that way
And if he was here he'd say Hoss neither did Hank
I ain't dogging what you're doing but then again, hell yes I am
I just don't give a damn 'cause you still got a lotta boot left to fill
I guess we all got a lotta boot left to fill
Yeah that's right"
"Well I have been a cowboy dang near all my life
That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll
Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes
[ guitar ]
Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah
[ keyboards ]
Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control
And he won't let go
But I'll get back to my cowboy music but sometimes you gotta play a little rock and roll
It's my turn it's about time
[ guitar ]"
"She wakes the kids up for school, the bacon is on the stove
He yells from their bedroom, honey, where'd you put my clothes
The school bus runs right on time
He forgets to kiss her good-bye, walks out talking on his phone
She cleans up the mess they made, goes upstairs and puts her makeup on
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
If she turns to another, she knows she'll have to answer to the lord
She wonders where the romance went
Why the man she fell in love with finds her so easy to ignore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
She's there when they get home, the day flew by so fast
She asked about his day, he interrupts, i need to cut the grass
And she's a-wishing as she does the dinner dishes
He'll notice her new dress she's got on
But he's still watching tv, she takes her bath and goes to bed alone
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore
If she turns to another, she knows she'll have to answer to the lord
She wonders where the romance went
Why the man she fell in love with finds her so easy to ignore
Just because she lives there don't mean she loves there anymore"
"A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord a wonderful Saviour to me
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock where rivers of pleasure I see
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadows have dried thirsty land
He hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand
And covers me there with his hand
[ piano ]
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord he taketh my burden away
He holdeth me up and Thy shall not be moved he giveth me strenght as my day
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock..."
"If it's true what you say in your letter if your sweet love for me is really gone
If there's somebody else that you love better
Pack your bag shake my hand and move along
Easy come easy go I found that long time ago
Ain't no future in the past broken hearts and all that jazz
No tears of mine're gonna flow I'll have another love tomorrow easy come easy go
So you took my photograph from your locket
And replaced it with the one you love the best
Give me back my ring and I'll go hock it what's one little diamond more or less
Easy come easy go...
Easy come easy go..."
"Uh...I met Shania Twain and I met ol Tim McGraw
Billy Ray Cyrus and little David Ball
A little bit of luck and my life will be complete
There's a little bitty blonde that I'd really want to meet
I sure like Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and a-eatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
But first I gotta lose a little bit of weight
My little bitty sweetie in her little nighty gown
A litty bitty kiss and I'd probably come unwound
I love to watch her dance and I like to watch her sing
Want a little better look at her belly button ring
I sure like Mindy McCready
Take a little ride down to Panama City
Just the two of us on her little bitty bus
With a whole lot of love and whole lot of lust
I work a little job for a crummy little check
Heck I'd trade it all for a hug around the neck
Paid a lot of hope for my little bitty scheme
Cause I could never fit in her litte bitty jeans
I'm a good old boy she's a pretty little girl
Wish I had a chance to rock her little bitty world
I'm a little bit insane cause I love her somethin fierce
Gonna go and get my big old belly button pierced
I'd sure like to meet Mindy McCready
Give me half a chance and buddy yes indeed-why
Guys do it all the time I'd better get in line
Better go and buy her some of Deana Carter's wine
I sure love Mindy McCready
Start pumpin iron and a-eatin my Wheaties
Got to get in shape
If I want to get a date
Be"
"It wasn't very long ago we had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I've trusted you you've trusted me the way that it's supposed to be
But the love slipped from us somewhere down the line
We had all of the good things going baby you know we did they were so kind
Enjoying the taste of the good life we all look for but few can't find
It's gone but we can't understand how love could slip right through our hands
On down the line things seem so very right
Our love went on for all these years we both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it was gone just over night
We had all of the good things...
Now that we've gone our separate ways I still recall those brighter days
The days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us are to blame we overly know that it's a shame
That all that we had going now is gone
We had all of the good things..."
"The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must a cannonballs fly before they're forever banned
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the wind
[ banjo ]
How many times must a man look up before he sees the sky
Yes and how many ears must one man howl before he can hear people cry
Yes and how many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the wind
[ harmonica ]
How many years can a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea
Yes and how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head and pretend he just doesn't see
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind the answer is blowing in the wind"
"Today you upped and walked right out the door
Said you wasn't coming round this place no more
And you didn't have to say it's not an act
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well I've treated you the best that I knew how
But what have I got to show for all that now
I've got a broken heart and that's somethin' you seem to lack
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well it seems a shame to me you'd leave this way
And I never thought I'd ever see the day
I gotta change my ways I see and that's a fact
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back
Well I've treated you...
It's gonna take a whole lot of somethin' to bring you back"
"Golden hair as bright as morning sunbeams
Eyes of blue that saw into your soul
A smile that could warm a winter's evening
Or touch a broken heart and make it whole
Her laugh was like the sound of angels singing
Her voice was a gift from God above
Amie saw a world that's filled with rainbows
And never met a soul she didn't love
God must need a very special angel
Whose heart's as pure as newly fallen snow
To come and join His choir of heavenly voices
And light the way that He would have us go
And so He called our very special angel
To spread her wings and take her final bow
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
To know that she is there beside Him now
A need for bringing happiness to others
Could fill her days wherever she might be
With songs, she touched the hearts of those who heard her
And now she's singing in our memories
The life she held so dear was only just beginning
Fame and fortune waited 'round the bend
The dreams she shared will never be forgotten
For the love she left with us will never end
God must need a very special angel
Whose heart's as pure as newly fallen snow
To come and join His choir of heavenly voices
And light the way that He would have us go
And so He called our very special angel
To spread her wings and take her final bow
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
To know that she is there beside Him now
Let our hearts be filled with joy instead of sorrow
To know that she is there beside Him now"
"Well here I sit, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman sittin' home with a month old child
CHORUS:
Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me.
Just sittin' around drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
Spent the groceries and half the rent
Like fourteen dollars and twenty seven cents.
(CHORUS)
They say roses are red and violets are purple
Sugar is sweet and so is maple surple
Well I'm the seventh out of seven sons
My pappy was a pistol
I'm a son of a gun.

"How Can You Buy Killarny / An Irish Lullaby
This little song I use to sing to my lad whose in the crowd tonight I'm going to embarrass him now when he was only a baby he is now 20 yrs old
An American landed on Erin's green isle
He gazed on killarny with a rapturous smile
How can I buy it he said to the guy
I'll tell you how with a smile he replied
How can you buy all the stars in the sky
How can you buy two Blue Irish eyes
When you can purchase a fine mothers heart
Then you can buy killarny
Nature restore on her guilt's with a smile
Me and Rose the shamrock and the barley
When you can buy all those wonderful things
Then you can buy killarny
Over in Killarny, Many years ago,
there's a song my mother sang to me
in a voice so sweet and low.
Just a simple Irish ditty,
in her sweet ould fashion way,
and I'd give the world if I could hear
that song of hers today.
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Hush, now don't you cry!
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
Too-ra-loo-ra-li,
Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral,
That's an Irish lullaby."
"On the hillside so lonely knelt Jesus one day
So wounded and worried he went there to pray
My friends there forsaken so lonely he feels
To heaven he's crying in helpless up here
But the golden day has broken in old Gethsemane
The mourner orphans singing the songs of victory
There's a new highway to glory the road that Jesus try
With a halo we're traveling the pathway too far
[ steel ]
On the hillside in garden such suffering I see
In humble submission he'll make honest plea
His blood streams of thirsty comes sinner be true
His cheeks are all crimson for me and for you
But the golden day has broken..."
"Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go
Didn't you believe me when I loved you
I guess you thought we were playing games
All this time I tried to think I've known you
I guess I really only knew your name
Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go
I thought you knew I lived my life just for you
There was just no price to big to pay
And even though I know I still live for you
The feeling's that you show won't let me stay"
"Well hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doin'
Well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Seems like just the other day
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
I gotta go now
Guess I'll see you hanging 'round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time, it's going to be okay
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it funny' how time slips right on, slips right on
Away, away, away"
"I'd like to be your mirror
Before it's someone else's turn
And try to get it right
And hope my karma improves
Or did i do you wrong
Or did i wait too long
Did i run through the trees
Did it cut you
Content to rest
Between the sky and the sea
Or did i do you wrong
Or did i wait too long
Did i run through the trees
Did it cut you
Content to rest
Between the sky and the sea"
"lyrics by Corb Lund, music by Stan Rogers / Corb Lund
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna good steed under me like my forefathers before
I wanna good mount when the bugle sounds and I hear the cannons' roar
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna horse in the volunteer force that's riding forth at dawn
Please save for me some gallantry that will echo when I'm gone
I beg of you sarge let me lead the charge when the battle lines are drawn
Lemme at least leave a good hoof beat they'll remember loud and long
I'd not a good foot soldier make, I'd be sour and slow at march
And I'd be sick on a navy ship, and the sea would leave me parched
But I'll be first in line if they'll let me ride, by god, you'll see my starch
Lope back o'er the heath with the laurel wreath underneath that victry arch
Let me earn my spurs in the battle's blur where the day is lost or won
I'll wield my lance as the ponies dance and the blackguards fire their guns
A sabre keen, and a saddle carbine and an army Remington
Where the hot lead screams with the cold, cold steel let me be a cavlryman
Let 'em play their flutes and stirrup my boots and place them back to front
For I wont be back on the rider-less black (jack) and I'm finished in my hunt
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna be in the cavalry, but I won't ride home no more"
"(Carlene Carter)
Poets have a way with words
Turn my tears to diamonds
Every phrase the right one
It's no wonder why I love him
I have waited all my life
Those tables took their time turnin'
My heart is forever burnin'
It's no wonder why I love him
It's sweetness, it's hit and miss
It's fever every time we kiss
It's heartache, he makes me shake
But, oh, what a way to go
Poets have a way with words
All mistakes made for wisdom
That's the way he sees them
It's no wonder why I love him
Why I love him
Why I love him"
"Pushin horns weren't easy like the movie said it was
And I don't recall no dance hall girls
Or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty
Rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep
'cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe""
Like the time we hit the river
And the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast
We thought it'd drown us all
We lost a lot of steers that day
And four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp
We knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and ""amazing grace"".
Or the night they broke behind us
And then took us by surprise
I whistled out to bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride
And I know he done his best
But he crossed over jordan ridin' dunny to his death
And we sang ""bringing in the sheaves"" and ""the rugged cross""
So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs
Or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves
And what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd benn born a hundred years ago
Still singin' ""strawberry roan"" and ""little joe"""
"I tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch ,trying to come to life
I jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
[Chorus]
Workin 9 to 5,what a way to make a livin
Barley gettin by, it's all takin and no givin
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
they let you dream just to watch'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship'll come in
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll you away
[Chorus]"
"On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number not a name, Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind
When that old judge looked down and smiled
Said I'll put you on that good road for a while, Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind
You can hear my hammer, you can hear my song
I'm gonna swing it like John Henry all day long, Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, gotta do my time
With an aching heart and a worried mind
It won't be long, just a few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways, Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She'll be waitin' for me when I've done my time"
"Well when I was a young man and never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over how much I'd missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
And then oh Lordy well I kissed her again
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh uh kisses sweeter than wine
Well I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged her and pleaded like a natural man
And then whups oh Lordy well she gave me her hand
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...
Well we worked very hard both me and my wife
A working hand in hand to have a good life
We had corn in the fields and whaet in the bins
And then whups oh Lord I was the father of twins
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...
Well our children then numbered just about four
And they all had the sweethearts a knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was whups oh Lord the grandfather of eight
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...
Well now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lotta kids a lotta trouble and pain
But then whups oh Lord we'd do it all again
Because she had kisses sweeter than wine..."
"Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love."
"You always find the way to hurt my pride if I'm not crying you're not satisfied
I don't know why you want to hurt me so
But if you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You're turning down the flame of love too low
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go
[ steel ]
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You can't love me and still want to hurt me so
If you're trying to break my heart you don't have very far to go"
"(Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way)
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way..
(A day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny bright was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank misfortune seem'd his lot
He got into a drifted bank and then us got upsot)
Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way...
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way"
"All alone I am yearning to be with you again
For a spark is still burning, it will ever remain
But I'm yearning in vain
The moon is high, the sky is blue
And here am I, but where are you?
A night like this was meant for two
And I am here, but where are you?
Have you forgotten the night that we met?
With so much to remember
How could you forget?
The dreams I dream have yet to come true
My dreams and I are here, but where are you?"
"You can't know the feelin' inside me that is stealin'
You can't know cause it don't show on me
You can't hear me sighin' or see my heart a cryin'
You can't know cause it don't show on me
Abuse done use refuse missuse that I got from you
But you can't know the feelin' cause it just don't show on me
You can't know the heartbreak and you can't feel the heartache
You can't know cause it don't show on me
You can't know I'm lonely and longing for you only
You can't know cause it don't show on me
Abuse done use refuse..."
"So your new love let your feelings sad and blue
And it broke your heart in two to see him go
Now you know the lonely nights that I went through
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so
When you cry yourself to sleep remember me
Think of all the things I told you long ago
You know how it feels to be the used to be
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so
Now that someone's broke your heart you realize
That the time has come to reap just what you sowed
For somebody else told you the same old lie
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so
When you miss the happiness you'll never find
Think of me each time the bitter teardrops flow
But you had no mercy on this heart of mine
And I'm glad that I can say I told you so"
"I had one kiss too many and it went right to my heart
What a fool I was to fall in love with you
I had one kiss too many and should've known right from the start
I was kissing someone who just couldn't be true
I knew the morning after I made a big mistake
That extra kiss was more than this poor heart of mine to take
I had one kiss too many, I remember it and I cry
'Cause when I kissed you I kissed my heart goodbye
I had one kiss too many and it took me by surprise
Now I know I'll never ever be the same
I had one kiss too many should've never close my eyes
'Cause I know that you were only playin' a game
I should've been contented to take a kiss and run
I had to hang around until I got that fatal one
I had one kiss too many it was just too much for me
Oh, but one kiss less my heart might still be free"
"First kiss I thought I died and gone to heaven
There in parking lot of that old 7/11
I filled up a truck,
I went in to pay, when I walked out
She was with him smilin' as she drove away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
If you play with fire you're bound to get burned
You would think by now that I would've learned
But she's lookin so hot, so what can I say
My mama said don't but I did it anyway
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
I wish you didn't look so dang good
I wish you wouldn't smile at me that way
There's an exit light shinnin' brighter than the sun
Like a sign from above tellin' me to run away
I know that's gonna leave a mark
Just like a tattoo on my heart
My little brunette wrecking ball with a sexy southern drawl,
Is gonna tear my world apart
And I know just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'll come runnin' when she whispers my name,
And like a tattoo on my heart I know that's gonna leave a mark.
And like a tattoo on my heart I know she's gonna leave a mark."
"YOU'VE GOT ME RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME
Writers Connie Smith, George Richey
Darling could I just have one moment with you
We're here all alone just us two
Let me try to tell you in a few little words
How my heart feels about you
If there were no rainbow I'd paint one for you
And I'd teach the robin a new song or two
Then I'd fight forever And hand it to you
Oh I wish there was more could do
You've got me right where you want me It's true
I'm right in the palm of your hand
You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want to be right where I am
You've got me right where you want me to be
And I want be right where I am"
"Carolina moon, lazy ol' River
Time keeps floatin' On By
Moss hanging from an oak tree
Baby it's just you and me
Sure makes one beautiful sight
We got postcard views
Curled up in this rocking chair
Feel like I ought tip my hat
To the man up stairs
Leavin' the light on

Burning the whole night through
Leavin' the light on

So I can look at you
Your pretty brown eyes
Your legs that go forever
Still can't believe you're mine
Come on baby lets take a walk
Follow the path down to that old dock
And bring along that bottle of wine
That old moon's so bright
Just hang in' up there
Feel like I ought count' my blessings
And thank the man upstairs for
Leavin' the light on
Leavin' the light on
Burning the whole night through

"I'm a long gone Waylon song on vinyl,
I'm a backroads sinner at a tent revival,
She believes in me like she believes her bible,
And loves me like Jesus does.
I'm a left foot leaning on a suped up Chevy,
I'm a good ol' boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee,
But she carries me, when my sins make me heavy,
And she loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams,
Both my broken wings,
Every single piece of everything I am,
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
And the devil man, he don't stand a chance,
Cause she loves me like Jesus does.
Always thought she'd give up on me one day,
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway,
Yeah, I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday,
That she loves me like Jesus does.
All the crazy in my dreams,
Both my broken wings,
Every single piece of everything I am,
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
And the devil man, he don't stand a chance,
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't,
She forgives me when I can't,
And the devil man, he don't stand a chance,
Cause she loves me like Jesus does.

"Here we sit lookin' at each other
Seems we're at a loss for what to say
Ties bind us both with someone else
We don't want to hurt but we must break away
And tonight I'll sit home a thinking
And tonight I'll sit home a drinking
We both live in separate homes where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil
[ fiddle - steel ]
Tomorrow we'll meet here in this same place
Where love and desire that just won't wait
In each others arms we'll dream for a little while
Then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild
And tonight again I'll sit home a thinking...
And tonight again I'll sit home a drinking
we both live in separate homes where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil"
"I found some shade beneath the willow tree
I fell asleep and started dreaming
That everything created here on Earth
All had voices singing
Every rock and every blade of grass
Even the ivy that was clinging
Every leap and every drop of rain
All had voices singing
It brought the angels down
In my dream so clear
And the Lord sat down.
So that he could hear
The sea and waves were rushing to the shore
With the joy that they were bringing
A sound so perfect that it made him cry
To hear their voices singing
I could not help but want to add my own
To all the praises that were ringing
And over all the world there fell a hust
To hear my one voice singing
And as the Lord sat down
The angels hovered near
But they made no sound
So that He could hear
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, I heard voices singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, I heard voices singing"
"Kentucky
You are the dearest land, outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky
I miss your laurel and your redbud trees
When I die,
I want to rest upon a graceful mountain so high
For that is
Where God will look for me
Kentucky
I miss the old folks singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky
I miss the hound dogs chasin' ooooonnn
I know that
My mother, dad and sweetheart are waiting for me
Kentucky
I will be coming soon
Kentucky"
"It's the skin and bones that keep me on the road
The shoulder blades of a beast that haunts my soul
wandering lonely and scared
I live the tragedy i share
It's quick to drag you in but hard to shake
It gives but doesn't match how much it takes
Growing stronger and loud
I lived it but now i'm wanting out
I built the fence, I hung the sign
Wine-red letters saying 'keep in mind where i've been so don't come in'
But how long can you live in shame
and drop a lifelong curse on your own last name?
The trouble is I'm used to it
It's the questions that keep me turning back
to see those rumors turn to fact
Wandering lonely and scared
I live the tragedy i shared
I built the fence, I hung the sign
Blood-red letters saying 'keep in mind where we've been so don't come in'
But how long can we live in shame,
and drop a lifelong curse on our own last name?
The trouble is we're used to it
It's the tin and boards that keep me going home
But it's who i am that won't let me alone
Growing stronger and loud
Growing stronger and loud"
"Follow me back like a ride on a train
Make it hard to remember the cold
Take care of your money and stay out of the rain
Your bones could give out when you're old
I get more of a feeling from words that have truth
A feeling like something is wrong
Let the door slide open, let the sunlight in
Call my name girl, Sorrow
All of the times that I heard you sing
I hoped there parts there for me
I'd sing all the notes that stay out of your way
We can let all those melodies free
I think I was meant for an uglier time
My harmony's all out of tune
Let the verse slide over let the chorus in
Call my name girl, Sorrow"
"Pair of boots and a sack of clothes
Free and easy down the road I go
Hanging memories on the high line poles
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
Ragweed's rocking on the radio
Free and easy down the road I go
So I keep rolling like an old banjo
Free and easy down the road I go
Got the sun shining on me like a big spotlight
So I know everything is gonna be alright
Ain't no telling where the wind might blow
Free and easy down the road I go
Living life like a Sunday stroll
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go
If you only get to go around one time
I'm gonna sit back and try to enjoy the ride
I could make a million or wind up broke
Free and easy down the road I go
Can't take it with you when you go so
Free and easy down the road I go
Someday I know it's gonna take me home so
Free and easy down the road I go
Free and easy down the road I go"
"On a cold Montana morning on the road to Idaho
I watched her order hot and black to go
In her boots and spurs and blue jeans
And the lonely in her eyes
Told me just how much she loved the rodeos
I asked where she was headin'
She said, the Boise show
She took a third in Butte just yesterday
She never has been married
And she probably never will
Silver buckle dreams
Don't leave time for standing still
Round and round and round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
The miles are gettin' longer
The nights they never end
Oh, the rodeos and livestock shows
Keep the lady on the go
Lord, she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows
For now on fifteen seasons
The circuit's been her home
At times she misses kids she never had
But she wouldn't trade a minute
Of the years that she's got in it
She's had herself some happy
She's learned to take the sad
When I looked up from my coffee
I saw Boise on her mind
She had that look of leavin' in her eyes
As she drove into the morning
It slowly dawned on me
How hard it is to tell a dream goodbye
Round and round and round she goes
Where she stops nobody knows
The miles are gettin' longer
The nights, they never end
Oh, the rodeos and livestock shows
Keep the lady on the go
Lord, she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows
Lord, she loves to run those barrels
It's the only life she knows"
"O the walls are closin' in I can feel it in my bones
Like water risin' up to my chin
Another long night to be alone
I could go out on the town
Talk too much and laugh too loud
If I'm already on my way down
I might as well just work the crowd
Can you hear me now
O the stories I could tell
Sometimes I really hit my stride
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell
Tryin' to get across to the other side
But everyday ends up the same
One step up, two steps back
Like some old silent movie frame
Zoom in close, then fade to black
Can you hear me now
How did the load get to be
so heavy I used to wear my trouble like a crown
A bad flood's poundin' on the levee
And I'm gonna need some help
To hold my ground
But I'm sinkin' like a stone
To where in solitude this life I'll spend
In the coldest place I've ever known
I'm here just waitin' until the end I send up my S.O.S.
A message in a bottle set out to sea It just reads"
"Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
seekin' my fame and fortune
lookin' for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
I came in on a Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
It looks like they took my friends
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Well The man from the magazine
He said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection and
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town on a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
And every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh, Lord, Stuck in Lodi again
Oh lord stuck in Lodi again"
"Rescue the perishing care for the dying snatch them in pity from sin and the grave
Weep o'er the erring one lift up the fallen tell them of Jesus the mighty to save
Rescue the perishing care for the dying Jesus is merciful Jesus will save
Though they are slighting him still he is waiting
Waiting the penitent child to receive
Plead with them earnestly plead with them gently
He will forgive if they only believe
Rescue the perishing care for the dying Jesus is merciful Jesus will save
[ piano ]
Rescue the perishing duty demands it
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide
Back to the narrow way patiently win them
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died
Rescue the perishing care for the dying Jesus is merciful Jesus will save"

"This old town is filled with sin
It'll swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away
You've got three years to pay
And Satan is waiting his turn
The scientists say it'll all wash away
But we don't believe anymore
'Cause we've got our recruits
In their green mohair suits
So please show your I.D. at the door
[Chorus]
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor your gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
A fool came around tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted in his crowd
So he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they ever had
[Chorus]"
"Come through ol' Nashville come through a flyin'
Studded bout my little darlin' couldn't keep from cryin'
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ fiddle ]
Goin' to Atlanta just to look around if things don't soothe me goin' on another town
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ dobro ]
Workin' on the railroad savin' all I can loojkin' for that woman ain't got no man
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ banjo ]
Standin' on the corner ten thousand miles from home
Studded bout them good times done past and gone
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go
[ fiddle ]
If I was a railroad man burnin' all of the time
So I can hear a lonehorn when she goes rollin' by
Honey babe I'm bound to ride don't you wanna go"
"I wonder which one of us is to blame
The nicest thing that's come my way is you but I cannot offer you my heart or name
Oh it isn't fair to do me like you do I wonder which one of us is to blame
Somehow I can't blame myself although I guess I should
And I can't place the blame on you I would have if I could
We've made ourselves the gossip of the town
The things we've done can only bring us shame
We've let our passion drag our honor down I wonder which one of us is to blame
Your nearness makes me tremble with desire your ruby red lips set my soul aflame
But for you I'd be a beggar thief or liar I wonder which one of us is to blame
Somehow I can't blame myself...
I wonder which one of us is to blame"
"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and by
Farther along we'll know all about it"
"Trailer for sale or rent rooms to left fifty cents
No phone no pool no pets I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah but two hours of pushing broom buys a eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road
Third boxcar midnight train destination Bangor Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road
Every engineer on every train all of the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing trailer for sale or rent,
Trailer for sale or rent rooms to left fifty cents"
"Takes a summer time in dollars at minimum wage
To buy some Pittsburg steel when you come of age and
Even more to get it running and shinning like you did
It was two tone tar heel blue and white
Couple kinwood speakers tuned just right
Crazy how a car makes a king out of a kid
It was sun down ready, hardtop heavy,
Shotgun girlfriend primed.
Just some teenage no fear,
Half bald good years that still turned on a dime
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
Momma still puts flowers out by your grave
Daddy pulls against Ford in Sunday's race
And Leah has a hard time thinking she's older than you
And me I still see you backing out in reverse
The headlights bright behind your hurst
If I only could fix things like someone I once knew
I wouldn't be sitting tangled mangled full of county junk yard pain
All busted rusted out here cussing crying out your name
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride in that bronco
It was a hell of a ride
It was a hell of a ride
It was freedom calling pulling you down that backroad
It was our time flying and a hell of a ride
It was small town high hopes
Why it ended there only heaven knows
A brother a hero and a hell of a ride in that bronco
It was a hell of a ride
Takes a lifetime of prayers on bend and knee
To try to come to peace with your memory"
"Gonna Find Me A Bluebird
Gonna find me a bluebird
Let him sing me a song
Cause my heart's been broken
Much too long
Gonna chase me a rainbow
Through a heaven of blue
Cause I'm all through crying over you.
There was a time my love was needed
My life completed, my dreams come true
Then came the time my life was haunted
My love unwanted, all for you.
(Repeat 1st verse )"
"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin', ""It's alright""
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs flashin'
Taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Seems like it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I've wondered
And it still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life, and you just gotta play the game
I find me a place in a box car
So I take out this old guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest and I'm alright
Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Yeah, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world, and it's rainin' on me"
"When I woke up today, I was feeling ok. But my mind started turning as breakfast was burning. My soul slipped away to a red evening sky, and a lovers sweet sigh, in the wink of an eye. In the wink of an eye.
Just try not to think, cause it will drive you to drink. But I cannot forget the all the things that you said while when were high. I was flying too high, hung out to dry, in the wink of an eye.
What more can I say, why should I even try. After reading your letter, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry, or just say goodbye, just say goodbye. With a wink in my eye.
La la lalalalalalalalalalaalalalalalala"
"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"

Green dresses, shirts and ties
And nothing could be brighter

We party hard the pray the Lord
Forgive us of our sins

Relieve our trouble hearts

"Oh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you it's you must go and I must bide
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
Yes I'll be here in sunshine or in shadows
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so
But when ye come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead as dead I well may be
Ya'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warmer sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me"
"The say nothin` lasts forever
Honey, I've got good news
Whoever said that
Never got the blues from you
This cloud I'm under
Looks like it's gonna stay
The thunders gonna roll
Forever and a day
Nothing's gonna change
The way I think and feel
My heart is so heavy
And my fate is sealed
Lord, stop this misery
Every night I pray
E'm knowin` that it's there
Forever and a day
[Chorus]
Forever and a day
You're stuf here in my mind
Forever and a day
Is such a long, long time
I tell myself again
That I just can't swim
This river of regret
That I'm drownin` in
You've left with this feeling
That I just can't shake
My spirit's gonna sink
Forever and day"
"I lost ten points just for bein'
In the right place at exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there
But I may as well have been completely blind
So if you see me walkin' all alone.
Don't look back I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
Looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't somethin' more to blame it on
But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hangin' on
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on
Thirteen-twenty North Columbus
Was the address that I'd written down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was gettin' time to leave
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said ""Lead on""
Cause there's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on"
"You say there's someone new
Well Baby that ain't news
Tell me something I don't know
You say your love has died
Well baby that's right
Tell me something I don't know
This may come as a surprise to you
But I'm not surprised at what you say you're gonna do
When you say you're leaving me
I ain't so blind that I can't see
Tell me something I don't know
I saw it coming from a mile away
I wasn't born yesterday
Tell me something I don't know
You say the feelings you once had are gone
This ain't where you belong
Tell me something I don't know
Before you sit me down to tell me more,
You oughta know I packed your bags
And they're waiting at the door.
So before you're on your way
If you've anything left to say
Tell me something I don't know
You say you're sorry now for breaking every vow
That's a good one baby,
Go ahead and take a bow
You say there's someone new
Well baby that ain't news
Tell me something I don't know
You say your love is gone
Well Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Baby go on tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me something I don't know
Baby go on"

Oh I had a bicycle
I had a train too"
"Laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Gentle roar of the wave on the shore
Makes its way through the crack neath the door
Wake up call from the ocean floor down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Tequila Sunrise with a coconut base, hammock swingin in the palm tree shade
Standard Island beach Resort cliche, hey, but thats okay
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Wind blowin on the back of my neck, sun reflectin off that tan on your breast
Found that feelin that we lost long ago down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key"
"She could see him comin' from a mile away
Kickin' up dust down the dirt road
She ran and met him at the front gate
Hopped in the truck and said let's go
You wouldn't think there'd be much to do
So far from the city lights
But give two kids all that room
And there's no tellin' what they'd find
They felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
The thing about bein' from a town that small
Is everyone's lookin' for a way out
But that never crossed their minds at all
After twenty good years there's no doubt
The two of them saw so much more
Than corn and barbed wire fence
They found a love worth stayin' for
And they've been together ever since
They felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
Oh they felt the rhythm of the wind
Blowin' through the wheat fields
The sun wasn't all that fell
As the moon began to rise
Beneath the stars in each other's arms
They were onto somethin'
It ain't called heartland for nothin'
We're in heartland, heartland"
"Well, I'm alive like a sprouting seed
Like the deepest roots of an ancient tree
I did not come here for the bread, no
I have come to wake the dead
They'll say tell us Jack what have you seen
Where will you go, now what does it mean
Come on boys, you got to do it right
Pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack, what do you know, what have you seen, where will you go
Come on boys, I got to tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told
I'm throwing heat like a funeral pyre, we can get along like a house on fire
This world she's cold, this world is mean, my heart is stone, my hands are clean
They'll say tell us Jack where will you go, what have you seen, what do you know
Come on boys, you got to do it right, pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack what do you know, where have you seen, where will you go
Come on boys, I gotta tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told
Watch me roll like an iron wheel, I can stack the deck when the spirits deal
Time cannot hold me in this cage, I'm cheating death, I jump the grave
They'll say tell us Jack, what have you seen, where will you go, what does it mean
Come on boys, you got to do it right
You better pray to the moon in the middle of the night
Come on Jack, where will you go, what have you seen, what do you know
Come on boys, I gotta tell you true, I'm a stranger here just like you
I get high as the morning sky, this song I sing will never die
I get low as a gravel road, in a thousand tongues my story's told"
"One Room Apartment So Crowded & Small
The tomcats' meowing, and the babies all squall.
My Sister has a boyfriend , but when he comes to call
She sits on the sofa, and he stands out in the Hall
someday they'll marry and raise a family
In our one Room Apartment they'll live in harmony!"
"You lived through the crash on the highway it's a miracle you're here today
You say Lady Luck was ridin' with you but it might be that your mother prayed
You were saved in the war over yonder
You say your good luck charm pulled you through
But the only reason that you might be living
Is your mother just might have been prayin' for you
Don't give Lady Luck all of the credit it might have been your mother's prayer
She holds the key to the powers in heaven and pleads with your Maker up there
Now you call yourself lucky and believe that it's true
But your mother just might have been prayin' for you
[ steel ]
Don't give Lady Luck..."
"(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Me an' RJ an' the kids was on a camp-out in the mountains, and we had us one'a them U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep cars which we rented from a fella by the name of Kubozke for thirty bucks a day, buy your gas along the way, take a rabbit's foot and leave a pint of blood for a dee-posit.
And he 'splained it all to us how we was supposed to get to Telluride, which is fifty miles away by way of the regular highway, however, there was a shortcut but unless we had drove the Black Bear Road before, we'd better be off to stay, stay in bed and sleep late. (Pay no attention to the gitar there.)
Well, we took up off'n the highway and we come upon a sign says ""Black Bear Road. You don't have to be crazy to drive this road, but it helps."" I says, ""RJ, this must the shortcut road Kubozke was talkin' about."" She didn't pay no mind, 'cause she was makin' peanut butter sandwiches for the kids in the back seat throwin' rocks and drinkin' Kool-Aid and playin' count-the-license-plates. But they wasn't havin' too much fun a-countin' license plate or cars, 'cause there weren't no other cars.
We went about a mile-and-a-half in about four hours, busted off the right front fender, tore a hole in the oil pan on a rock as big as a hall closet. Went over a bump and spilt the Kool-Aid and Roy Gene stuck his bolo knife right through the convertible top and the dog threw up all over the back seat. Peanut butter don't agree with him, you see.
So we had to stop and take off the top and air everything out and clean it up. The dog run off and RJ says she felt her asthma comin' on. I was sittin' there wonderin' what to do when the en-tire scenic San Joo-wan U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car sank in the mud. At thirteen thousand feet above sea level.
Well, we shoveled it out and ate our lunch, the dog made a yellow hole in the snow and Roy Gene got out his Instamatic and took a snapshot of it. Mary Elizabeth drawed a picture of the road; it looked like a whole bunch a' Zs and Ws all strung together. And RJ took one look at it and said that the only way that Jeep car is goin' down that road is over her dead body. Then a rock slipped out from under the wheel and the U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car went right over the edge of the cliff. Yahoo-oo-oo-oo!
""Doggone-it, Roy Gene! How many times do I have to 'splain it to you? When I tell you to put a rock under the wheel, I mean rock! Now look at that, what you have there is no bigger'n a grapefruit."""
"In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot,
On a bar stool she took off her ring.
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over.
I sat down and asked her her name.
When the drinks finally hit her,
She said, ""I'm no quitter,
But I finally quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter,
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings.""
In the mirror I saw him,
And I closely watched him.
I thought how he looked out of place.
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me.
He had a strange look on his face.
The big hands were calloused,
He looked like a mountain,
For a minute I thought I was dead.
But he started shaking,
His big heart was breaking,
He turned to the woman and said,
""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.
After he left us, I ordered more whiskey.
I thought how she'd made him look small.
From the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all.
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind.
I couldn't hold her, for the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time.
""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.
""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.

"Wagon wheels wagon wheels keep on a turning wagon wheels
Roll along sing your song carry me over the hill
Go along mule there's a steamer at the landin'
Waiting for this cotton to load
Go along mule the boss is understandin'
There's a pasture at the end of each road
Wagon wheels wagon wheels keep on a turning wagon wheels
Roll along sing your song wagon wheels carry me home
Wagon wheels carry me home
Go along mule"
"To lay me down
Once more to lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by
All lost in dreaming
To lay me down
One last time
To lay me down
To be with you
Once more to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by
Like clouds a-streaming
To lay me down
Once more

Once more

One more to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
To lie beside you

To tell sweet lies
One last time
And say good night

One last time

"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"
"There's a thief in my bedroom but I'm not afraid
Thieves all get caught by mistakes that they've made
This one has torn my emotions apart somebody's stealing my heart
Well somebody's kisses are wet on my lip somebody's face is at my fingertips
Somebody's holding me tight in their grips somebody's stealing my heart
There's a thief in my bedroom
Well somebody's kisses"
"A friend of mine came up to me and he said if I could see
All the mighty works of Christ down here below
When he said I could believe and my doubts he could releave
Cause I'm the kind of guy that's got to know
I was taken by surprise and I looked into his eyes
For I thought that he could see as well as I
I said my friend just let me show you what the Master left below
And by fate you surely see if you try
Cause everytime the roses bud and everytime the rivers flood
Then I know I seen the works of the Lord
Everytime a robin flies or a newborn baby cries
Then I know I seen the works of the Lord
Cause everytime the roses bud"
"My little boy on the kitchen floor
(My little Basquiat)
Stick men fighting stick dinosaurs
(My little Basquiat)
Colors leaping all over the mat
(My little Basquiat)
The kitchen floor is where it's at
For my little Basquiat
One day he'll be golden
Maybe chosen perhaps to lead
One day he'll be shaken
Maybe taken perhaps to bleed
My big girl swinging from the bars
(My little comaniche)
Fist of stone flying above the yard
(My little comaniche)
Halfway up is halfway down
(My little comaniche)
Now maybe it's the other way around
For my little comaniche
One day she'll be moonlight
Maybe too bright perhaps to shine
One day she'll be found out
Maybe ground down, perhaps she'll cry
My little girl on her mother's lap

Sucking on her fingers, surveying the road map
(My little panchen lama)
Seems to be the only one around

That sees the red lights at the end of town

One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
One day they'll be older
Maybe bolder perhaps than me
One day they'll be rising
Maybe living perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace
Perhaps in peace"
"(Just to know that you were mine to lose)
If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go
Cause that would mean you once belonged to me
I'd gladly face the heartache of losing you some day cause at least I'd have a memory
Through all the years I've known you you never noticed me
Just a friend that's all I've been to you
I'd gladly let you break my heart for just one memory
Just to know that you were mine to lose
If I could hold you just one time for one short moment heaven would be mine
If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go just to know that you were mine to lose
Oh if I could only hold you..."
"I was sittin' in Friday's suckin' on a glass of wine
When in walked a chick who almost struck me blind
Had wet blue eyes and her legs were long and fine
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give her a nine.
Now on my scale there ain't no ten's, you know
Nine is about as far as any chick can go
So I flashed her a smile, but she didn't even look at me
So for brains and good judgement, I'd give her a three.
I said, ""Hey sweet thing, you look like a possible eight
You and me could, uh! make eighteen, if your head's on straight.""
She looked up and down my perfect frame
And said these words that burned into my perfect brain.
She said, well, another one of those macho-matician men
Kind who grade all women on scales of one to ten
And, you give me an eight, well, that's a generous thing to do
Now, let's just see, just how much I give you.
She said you comin' on to me with that phony numbers jive
Your style makes me smile, I give it a five
When you walked up I noticed that suit of (yores)
It's last year's double-knit frayed-cuffs, give it a four.
That must be your car parked out on the curb
That sixty-nine homemade convertible, a three and a third
Now, as for your build, I guess (yore) less than five
Except, for your pot belly, I'd give that a ten for size.
That wine you're pourin' might be fine to you
But I'm used to fine champagne, I give it a two
It's hard to tell what your flashin' smile is worth
I give it a six, you could use some dental work.
But, It's your struttin' rooster act that really makes me laugh
It may be a ten to these country hens, but to me a three and a half
And there really ain't much to add once the subtractin's done
Since there ain't no zeroes, I give you a one!.
She walked out, while up and down the line
The whole bar was laughin', said' Bare, what happened to your nine
Nine says I, hell soon as she started to talk I knew
She didn't have no class, I barely gave her a two.
Spoken:
Yeah! No matter how good they look at first
There's flaws in all of them
That's why on a scale of ten to one, friend
There ain't no ten."
"Oh Daisy Mae my honey oh Daisy Mae
When I'm with you my darling all my cares go away
Oh don't you know sweetheart that I love you so
Cause you're my darling precious Daisy Mae
So nice and neat with kisses so very sweet
In my opinion darling you just can't be beat
And now I found you no one else will ever do
I'm tryin' make you happy Daisy Mae
Oh Daisy Mae my honey...

You're everything you're every song that I sing
Your lovely little hand looks lovely with that ring
It won't be long until you'll hear our weddin' song
And you'll be mine all mine Daisy May

"Came in last night, at half past ten,
That baby of mine, he wouldn't let me in.
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over little dog cause the big dogs movin in
Well he changed the locks on my front door,
And my poor key it don't fit no more
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over skinny dog, cause the fat dog's movin' in.
Well this dog house here is mighty small,
But better than no house at all.
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over old dog cause the new dogs movin in.
Well he told me not to play around
But I don't let no deal go down.
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over nice dog cause the mean dogs movin' in
Well he warned me once, he warned me twice
But I don't take no ones advice
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over short dog cause the tall dogs movin' in.
He'll crawl back to me, on his knees
But I'd been busy scratchin' fleas
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over good dog cause the mad dogs movin' in
Well remember pup before he whined
That's sides yours and this sides mine
So I'm Movin' on over. Movin' on over.
Move over cold dog cause the hot dogs movin' in."
"I called you today, an accidental mistake
And your name slipped out to some friends
Forgotten old feelings are brand new today
'Cause I'm right back where I've always been
You're just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see you around
You're just an old love turned memory
But you still turn my world upside down
I went to some places where I knew you'd be
Just to prove our love was over and done
But the moment my eyes met yours
I knew my sorrow had only begun
You're just an old love turned memory
Now I seldom see you around
You're just an old love turned memory
But you still turn my world upside down"
"Wham bam thank you ma'm I'll be on my way thank you but no thank you not today
First thing is matrimony next thing is alimony
Wham bam thank you ma'm I'll be on my way
I'm just too young to get married you see there's too many places that I'd rather be
There's a lotta other fishes in the deep blue sea
So wham bam thank you ma'm that's not for me
Wham bam thank you ma'm...
I'm not the kinda guy to buy a ring I'm afraid of weddin' bells and rice and things
I'm just too restless I'll never settle down

"Put on another pot o' tea
'Cause I'm in love with the Irish accent to your story
And I need someone to help me
Well they say that now you don't talk straight
And that of late it's been my lot to be afraid
To remember you by anything
But memories I already keep
So put another pot o' tea
'Cause I'm love with the Irish accent to your story
And now I need some sympathy
It's harder when it takes so long to leave
The table where we all learned to laugh and learned to grieve
Over the pain that came so close to you
It comes so close to me today"
"Ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh
It's another red light after the red I flight
And I swear, I can smell your perfume
I turn the key and I watch you sweet
It's another goodbye
And I don't if I can get through
The day with just one kiss
I'm on the freeway
I'm in the fast lane wondering how
Turn this car around
And I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home
I need your love
And girl, I'm coming home
You know no one can erase
The smile on my face
My heart beats faster with every mile
I'm getting close and closer
Turn this car around
And I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home
I need your love
And girl, I'm coming home
Turn this car around
Turn this car around
And I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home
I need your love

"When I stood on the top of a high high mountain
And watched the sun rise in the dawn
I walked by aside a cold cold river and heard the nightingale song
I once saw the king of a mighty nation the princess and I had a conversation
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
I salied many times in a deep deep ocean watched waters roll on many sands
Spent a night just a looking at a high high heaven and marvel that God's mighty hand
I tremble like a baby when I see a snowfall
Or standing in the forrest where the trees're so tall
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
Through the small port window of a big main whiner I watched the cities rush by
And the gay shining wings of a great steel eagle were just aburn in the sky
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
[ fiddle ]
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you"
"Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
Tell me you love me for a million years
Then if it don't work out
If it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
If you must go I won't grieve
If you'll wait a lifetime
Before you leave
If you must go no I won't grieve
If you'll wait a lifetime
Before you leave"

When shall the moment come
When I shall lay this armor by
and dwell in peace at home

We'll work till Jesus comes
We'll work till Jesus comes

There are burdens here we all must bear
With trouble pressing so
There will be no sorrow over there
On heaven's peaceful shore
We'll work till Jesus comes
We'll work till Jesus comes
We'll work till Jesus comes

There is work on earth for me and you

Should be done as to the Lord

"Is that a green light? Is that a stop sign?
I don't know which way that you want me to go
Trying to look deep in your blue eyes
Do I lean on in or just leave it alone?
It's like I'm lost in a hundred acre field
No map and I've got no lights
Wondering what kind of friends you wanna be
I'm wishing I could read your mind
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
Do you want me like I want you?
Or is this just how you treat all the guys?
Are you a little tease or are you into me?
Is this is a game you play, oh, give me a sign
It's like I'm lost in a town I've never been before, just driving around
Girl, you've gotta help me out
Gotta tell me which roads you want me to go down
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
I'm out here wondering where to go
Doing nothing but it's just a dead end road
So here I go, leaning in, nice and slow
I just gotta know
Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere
No, don't leave me in the middle of nowhere
I just wanna kiss you one the time
Girl I wanna go there
Baby, would it be alright
Oh, I'm so lost tonight
Out here in the middle of nowhere"
"Desperation's causing me,
To question every single word you say,
The distance that keeps growing in between us,

Well you tried so hard to carry on,
But I can tell there's something wrong these days,
Well girl I've got to know the truth,
Just give it to me straight,
Don't' look away,
Don't look away,
Don't look away,
When I ask you if you love me still,
And if your gonna stay,
Don't look away,
Well I've known you long enough to know,
You're trying not to let your feelings show,
Lately when I hold you near,
I still feel I'm sitting hear alone,
This confusion setting in your mind,
Blocking all the words you mean to say,
Well girl I've got to know the truth,
Just give it to me straight,
Don't look away,
Don't look away,
Don't look away,
When I ask you if you love me still,
And if your gonna stay,

A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste

No don't let me be lonely
When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
We grow up
And then it's gone
Oh God only knows what we'll become
So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely
Well the night rolls on like a long lost friend
'Til the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
Don't let me be lonely
Well there's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
Give me all that you are
You've got nothing to lose

No don't let me be lonely
So don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive

No
Don't let me be
When you're young
Life's a dream
It's a beautiful and a burning thing
We grow up
And then it's gone
But the memory goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Don't let me be, let me be, let me be lonely tonight
While we're young and alive
Take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
Oh don't let me, let me be lonely
Don't let me be lonely
Don't, don't let me be lonely
No
Don't let me be
Ooh, lonely"
"The moment was custom-made to order:
I was ridin' with my daughter on our way back from Monroe.
An' like children do, she started playin' twenty questions,
But I never could've guessed one would touch me to my soul.
She said: ""Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay?
""Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
""An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""
Well, I won't lie: I pulled that car right over,
An' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes.
An' I whispered: ""Lord, I want to thank you for my children.
""'Cause your innocence that fills them often takes me by surprise.""
Like: ""Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay?
""Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
""An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""
Well, I thought about it later on,
An' a smile came to my face.
An' when I tucked her in to bed,
I got down on my knees an' prayed.
Lord, when I get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""I don't want to come to visit 'cause I'm comin' home to stay?
""An' I can't wait to see my family and meet Jesus face to face.
""An' do you think, Lord, you could use just one more Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""
Mmmm, can I help pour out the rain?"
"Yeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin
No, I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you think
Oh, cause back when we were lovin' she thought cowboys were something
Now' they ain't
Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No, she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh, and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen
And trucks, ha-ha
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
Yeah she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her you're just a heartache in a Wrangler pearl snap shirt
Lassoed and let go for the last time
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind
She ain't just over me, she's over me and my kind"
"The word is faithful, look it up
It don't mean sneakin' around
Behind my back like you ain't gettin' enough
How 'bout forever,
Just look it up
It means through thick and thin
And pitchin' in even when the times get tough
The word is easy, look it up
And you'll see a picture of that piece of trash
Ridin' 'round in your pickup truck
Let's try liar,
Just look it up
But you'll need boots to wade through all the bull
You tell me when you come home drunk
It's just like you to be so clueless
'Cause you never thought I'd do this
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
You said you're sober, look it up
It's right next to hell is freezin' over,
Flyin' pigs, and all that stuff
And how bout baby, look it up
It's what you call me and it's how you act
Every time I call your bluff
It's just like you to keep denyin'
Save your whinin' and your cryin'
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
The word's forgiveness, look it up
It's what Jesus has in store for you
But I don't no matter what
Quit your beggin' and your prayin'
Can't you hear what I've been sayin'?
I said go, goodbye, get lost, get out, get gone
The word is over
Look it up
Asshole
Just look it up, look it up"
"(Girl you sure know how to say goodbye)
You kissed me and you said I was a gentleman to you
You said I was a person you could trust
You told me that you love me in a way that couldn't die
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You kissed me in a way you never did when love was right
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
I stood and watched you walk away and I didn't even cry
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You gave me that old pep talk as you cried on my sleeve
You said that you'd come running day or night
You said that I could call on you throughout my lonely life
Girl you sure know how to say goodbye
You kissed me in a way"
"It ain't nothin' but a small frame house on an acre lot
It ain't that much diff'rent from any other house on the block
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
But at least one thing's for sure, I got it honest
Roll out of the sack every mornin', head on down to the mill
Give 'em all I got for eight, 'cause that's the deal
If you'll check out my paycheck
Well, you'll see that there ain't that much on it
But ev'ry single penny I'm paid, I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause buddy if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest
Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And I might seem like some kind of low-life
To that highfalutin' crowd
But I'm plain spoken, straight talkin'
And damn proud of what I have accomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
But, I got it honest
Now when I die, I may not leave my kids a fortune
But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause brother if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest
Friend there ain't no doubt about it, I got it honest"
"Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yeah, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you was coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
Yeah, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
Yeah, the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end"
"I have heard of a land on the faraway strand
This beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high there we never shall die
This the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old never grow old in the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old never grow old in the land where we'll never grow old
In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king through eternity sing
This the land where we'll never shall die
Never grow old...
When our work here is done and the life's crown is won
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before
Never grow old..."
"Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew
Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone
Ooh, but I remember everything she said
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottle of blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes"
"He sat there in his chair
Her arms around him tight.
You can't blame the lady
The lady she is blind
She said it's wrong to kill this man
Even if he's killed your child
Revenge is mine, said the Lord
Well the Lord's one lucky guy
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
An eye for an eye
Would leave the whole world blind
Forgiveness is the way
But I can't forgive his crime
And if I had the chance
In truth I'd have to say
I'd gun that bastard down
With a smile on my face
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
Don't do as I do
A wiser man would say
But on a journey of revenge
Be sure to dig two graves
And when they throw us in 'em
I hope the lady finally sees
Bears witness to the wrong and right
And knows which one I'll be
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall
Pray for the innocent
Justice for all
Strike a blow for justice
Hear the gavel fall"
"(Dolly Parton)
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing ""In The Sweet By And By""
The we'd sing ""I'm On My Way To Canaan Land""
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man"
"Just getting by is getting old
Locked up inside this pigeonhole
Breaking my back with my bare hands
Some of us can't some of us can
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion on the sun
Been hanging ?round and holding on
Here underground way too long
Losing my mind digging for gold
All I can find as life unfolds is
I don't have it in me
A bullet needs a gun
And in the land of plenty
They need a champion
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sun
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
It?s unpopular
To be unpopular
isn't it sad?
The ending won't be a happy one
I'm one more of many
Not a lion in the sun"
"I want to share your life
Every minute, every day and night
I just want you to know
That whatever you do
And wherever you go
Remember
Someone loves you honey
No matter what, just be my girl
Someone loves you honey
More than anything in the world
I'm so glad that I'm the one
That you come to
When you need someone
That's what my love is for
It's a shoulder to lean on
A in the storm
Remember
Someone loves you honey
No matter what, just be my girl
Someone loves you honey
More than anything in the world"
"If you've got two or three minutes well I'd like to tell you a story
It's a story about a preacher
And there's a lotta stories about a lotta preachers
But this story that I wanna tell you is about a protectoral preacher
Who went over seas to fight a war
Now this is a war forgot and not for any country
And he fought a long long time and he won a whole lot of souls
But finally this preacher got old and he was coming home
He just happened to be on the same ship with someone
Whom we call a famous celebry
When the boat docked there were thousands there to meet the celebrity
And they carried him off of his shoulders
But you there wasn't no one there to meet the preacher
And he looked into the heavens and said Lord did you forget me
And it seemed like the heavens broke open
And he said no son I didn't forget but you must remember you're not home yet
You're not home you're not home you're not home yet
I can still hear my Lord's voice ringing
There'll be a crowd to greet you a choir of angels to meet you
I didn't forget but son you're not home yet
I didn't forget but son you're not home yet"
"Passion in the backseat, parked out in the cane
Ever since the first time, I ain't ever been the same
I gave up on baseball and I threw down my glove
I discovered girls and I got into love
Me and my friend Aldo, he's the one who had the car
We made all the dances, we made all the bars
Told each other secrets and we wore each others clothes
One night I stole his woman and I wonder if he knows
Sleep all day, run all night
Chasing the ladies 'cause we knew they might
We raised a lot of hell, we made a lot of noise
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Everybody knew, we were Bayou boys
Sweet, Marie was dangerous with those dark seductive eyes
She had me sayin', 'maybe, baby' before I realized
She loved me so deeply and I tried to hold on
But changin' don't come easy when you've been this way so, lo"
"Well if I had a nickel I know what I would do
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Well if you were a kitten with pretty glossy fur
I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr
I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Oh if you were a tiger, I'd hang around your den
I'd pester you, my honey until' you let me in
Oh I'd pester you, my honey until' you let me in
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Well if you were a horsefly and I an old gray mare
I'd stand and let you bite me and never move a hair
I'd stand and let you bite me and never move a hair
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you
Well if you wanna marry now let me tell you what
We'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot
We'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot
'Cause that's how much I love you, woman
That's how much I love you"
"Drop, raindrop fallin' from the sky like magic
Can ya feel it in the air
Drop, you oughta drop on by 'cause it's warm inside
And there's a storm out there
I'll drop, another log on to the fire
Get the flame a little higher
""Til it feels just right
And I'll drop, a blanket on the floor
There's some wine I'm gonna pour
And pull the shades down tight
Ain't nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I'll turn the lights down, way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl, I know it's true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you
Drop, your hair down your shoulders
Get a little closer 'cause it's that kinda day
I'll drop, drop the needle on the record
The one that makes ya wanna love the night away
Ain't nowhere you need to be
Then wrapped up here with me
I'll turn the lights down, way down low
You let that dress drop nice and slow
Girl, you know it's true
You know just what to do
To make me drop everything for you
Ain't nowhere you need to be

Come on drop, drop everything for you
You make me wanna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Yeah, drop everything for you
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop

"I found him by the railroad track this morning I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened just to hear the words the dyin' fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco for ten long years I paid for what I done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana to see my Rose and get to know my son
Give my love to Rose please won't you Mister
Take her all my money tell her buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him and don't forget to give my love to Rose
[ guitar - steel ]
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waitin' for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another cause it ain't right she should live alone
Mister here's the bag with all my money it won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning now don't forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose...
Please don't forget to give my love to Rose"
"(Dolly Parton)
A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"
"It's yer
Sweet interjection
Kind of affection
Boring contraption
Gooey confection
Circumlocution
Rasputin tootin
Dismal depression
Rich little impression
Cosmic connection
Third world oppression
Antique collection
Recording session
Texas seccession
Troubling vibration
Doubling inflation
Mystic incantation
Pagan celebration
Taxation without representation
Makes me roll..."
"There was an old, blind man
Who stood on the corner down town
he was holding a cup
Filled up with nothing
From the christmas shopping crowd
And though I barely came up to the top of his cane
I reached up and gave him
Every cent to my name.
(chorus):
Three little pennies.
Were all that I had
One that I'd found
Two from my dad
Three little pennies not much of a gift
But Dad said ""that's plenty, if it's all you can give.""
that evening my dad told a wonderful story to me
About a child and the manger.
The wise men who came bearing gifts on the first christmas eve.
There was a part I'm sure he made up
About a stable boy who couldn't give much..
(chorus)
Three little pennies.
Were all that he had
One that he'd found
Two from his dad
Three little pennies not much of a gift
But Dad said ""that's plenty if it's all you can give.""
next morning was christmas
And I had prayed hard for a bike
But all that I found was the tiniest box
With three shiny pennies inside
and I was so disapointed because I had been good
But times had been bad so I understood.
And daddy said:
""three little pennies.
Were all that you had
But you gave them freely
So I gave them back
Three little pennies not much of a gift
You're bike is outside because you've learned how to give"""

I've had to think up a way to survive
Since you said it's over
Told me good-bye
I just can't make it one day without you
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true
Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is a lie
I'm perfectly fine
And I don't miss you
The sky is green
And the grass is blue
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks
Can one end their sorrow
Just cross over it
And into that realm of insanitive bliss
There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the Arctic
And crying is fun
And I'm happy now
And I'm glad we're through
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And the rivers flow backwards
And my tears are dry
Swans hate the water
And eagles can't fly
But I'm alright now
Now that I'm over you
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And I don't love you
And the grass is blue"
"Well, I wish I had my picture on The Rolling Stone today
I wish that The Enquirer spread a rumor that I was gay
Well, I wish I had some buddies, some movie stars and such
'Cause I probably wouldn't worry about the two of us as much
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
You know I, I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada, she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard, my hair blowin' in the wind
And I'd stop at fancy restaurants and they'd finally let me in
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today
Yeah, I wish I had my picture with the Rolling Stones today
And I wish The Enquirer would spread a rumor that I was gay
I wish I knew a movie star, someone like Charlie Sheen
'Cause if he'd hang out with Kato Kaelin well I guess he'd hang out with me
And I'd spend all my money on caviar and Rogaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today"
"Thought I died and gone to heaven
When I first saw her there
Standin' there in a sweat stained stetson
With her cow at the County Fair
I thought I knew how to make a move
But I can't make her mine
I wish I could forget her
But there's just somethin' in her smile
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
Well her momma said, She liked old westerns
So I did my best John Wayne
Said, I bet we'd go together
Like grits on a gravy train
When I leaned in she gave a little grin
And puckered up her lips
And hit right where she was aimin'
Now there's a little brown stain on my blue tag
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
I know it's wrong but I can't resist
Thinkin' 'bout the taste of that first kiss
'Cuz she chews tobacco
Rides on her tractor, drives all the cowboys wild
She's a tall drink of water, a real farmers daughter
For her love I'd walk a country mile
But I can't get within spittin' distance
No matter how I beg or plead my heart's a crackin'
She chews tobacco but she won't choose me
My heart's a crackin', she chews tobacco but she won't choose me"
"WHEN IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
Writer Kenny O'Dell
You like to mix with people, I like to be alone
Baby you can stay out all night, and I'd just as well stay home
Two people with so little in common, and different as we can be
We come together around midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree
Sometime long 'round midnight when it's just you and me
You love to hear the music, you just get up and dance around
Baby, you can act so crazy, you turn it up way too loud
Oh, I've got my share of hang-ups but you never seem to see
And as we come together 'round midnight when it's just you and me
When it's just you and me and there's nothing between us Oh, but our own sweet love
When it's time to be tender and try to remember what we're doin' here
Baby, I don't mind we're not two of a kind, just so we agree

"It's my third cup of coffee
The fifth time I said I'm sorry
The sun slowly peakin' through the glasses
Says we've been up all night
We both know where this is going
It's been a long time coming
Is it really over?
Is this really goodbye?
Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe
Buy a little more time
But I got nothing
No magic words
To stop your leaving
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm starring into a space
Prayin' please, please let me think of something
'Cause I got nothing
I watch you pack your things
You look down at your ring
Slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed
Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need
But I got nothing
No magic words
To stop your leaving
To end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm starring into a space
Prayin' please, please let me think of something
'Cause I got nothing
You're almost at the door
And you stop and turn around
You're eyes are begging me
Please say something right now
But I got nothing
No magic words
To stop your leaving
And I can't end this hurt
I'm just blank
I'm starring into space
Praying please, please let me think of something
'Cause if you go
I got nothin'"
"Sometimes this old road
Gets so damn lonesome away from home
Ain't no way in sight, head on back
Nobody knows the way it feels
Suffer through this living hell
Unless you've been on down that road yourself
Boy, don't you know I ain't really a bum
I was once a clean cut mothers son?
And you know down deep inside still I am
But this rodeo life's got it's hold on me
And there ain't no way to set me free
You know I've gotta be a rodeo man
Skinny old dog on the rodeo grounds
Scroungin', sniffin', lookin' around
In a lot of ways, well, I'm just like him
'Cause I'm eating up scraps off the dinner table
In a greasy cafe 'til I'm able
To ride those broncs good enough to win
Boy, don't you know I ain't really a bum
I was once a clean cut mothers son?
And you know down deep inside still I am
Oh, this rodeo life's got it's hold on me
And there ain't no way to set me free
You know I've gotta be a rodeo man
You know I've gotta be a rodeo man"
"We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy that was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz"
"You know I feel most the time like a kite on a line
Tossed about, no control, any way the wind blows
Then I see you holding on
The string that runs, me to you all that keeping me tied to
This world so long
Oh I'd be gone
So don't let me go
I might fly away
Come on talk me down
When the light turns to black, when the weight on my back
Gets to much, I start to bend, can not straighten out again
I feel you there, you lift me up
When I'm out on the ledge just one step from the edge
You take my hand
You understand
When no one else can get through
All I want to hear is you
Saving me, saving me from myself"
"Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
And slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
Now I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
More and more I need you and want you by my side
More and more I love you as each day passes by
No I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you slowly
I'm falling more in love with you"
"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone"
"Well I'm tired of travelin' down this rocky old road
This old heart of mine is so hurtin' from a heavy load
Only Jesus knows the way my heart went wrong
But the Lord he knows I'm bout to bringin' on home
Oh I'm bringin' it yes I'm bringin' it
I'm bringin' it hear me talkin' I said I'm bringin' it
This old heart's been away too long and I'm bringin' it home
When the angels come and carry me away
And I have to face the Lord on that judgement day
I've got a half an hour to stand before His throne
That means to changin' my heart and I'm a bringin' it home
Oh I'm bringin' it
Someday children you're gonna hear that trumpet's sound
There'll be lightnin' and thunder and earthquakes in the ground
[ Dallas ]
Don't let the devil tell you that your hope is gone
There'll be a whole lotta fights that will never go on
Oh I'm bringin' it
Oh I'm bringin' it"
"They tell me that you're going away what makes you want to leave
You gave me your love you gave me your vows now you're leaving me here to grieve
Live and let live don't break my heart don't leave me here to cry
I never could live if we should part so tell me you don't mean goodbye
[ guitar ]
I stayed awake last night and walked the floor what makes you grieve me so
Live and let live don't break my heart I don't want to live if you go
Live and let live..."
"YOUR MEM'RY COMES ALONG
(Johnny Tillotson - Paul Tannen)
'65 Ridge Music
(Then your mem'ry comes along)
Tears start falling I can hardly see my heart's breaking for oh lonesome me
I tell myself I'll be alright and nothing's really wrong
Oh but just then about that time your mem'ry comes along
Each day I tell myself the hurtin's hurtin' less and less
And that I should be happy that you're gone
But time and time again I feel so lonely and I guess
Oh that's the time your mem'ry comes along
And now my tears start falling I can hardly see...
Each day I tell myself to go and find somebody new
To replace the love I loved so long
Oh but when I'm holding someone else instead of holding you
Oh that's the time your mem'ry comes along
Tears start falling I can hardly see...
But just then about that time your mem'ry comes along"
"Well what do you think about loving baby

"Every day I read ads in the paper
Saying come to the islands
Bikini'd ladies sweet rum drinks, yeah
They'll keep you smiling
But I've got calypso music on the record at home
And when it comes to the warmth and sunshine
Well, I got my own
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
Your paradise to me
White sunny sand palm trees and tans
It's sounds so inviting
(Sounds so inviting)
Limbo dancing and star light romancing
It's all so exciting
But I got my flowery shirt
And rum punch in my hand
And my own exotic lover in my native land
You're my Jamaica
You're where I want to be
You're my island when I am being
Tossed on a stormy sea
My heavenly haven
Where I can spend eternity
You're my Jamaica
You're paradise to me"
"It`s over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more I`ll share
Now he's gone, I`m alone
I was wrong, should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him, watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby`s eye
Walked away, didn't know
That I`d soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn`t see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind, in my heart, I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last date"
"I don't care that you done me wrong
'Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartenders time
Trying to catch a buzz over the thought of us.
But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen.
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby you ain't worth the whiskey.
It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart
'Cause I'm drinkin' to a country song.
To another long work week gone
And I'm raisin my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen.
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby you ain't worth the whiskey."
"I walked half way across this town
Singing in the pouring rain
I knew someway somehow
I had to see your smiling face
Some people need some time
Some people need their space
But when you're not in my arms
You're too far away (for)
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
My friends all ask me why
I lay my heart on the line
But somewhere deep down inside
They know exactly why
When it don't go like you plan
There's nothing that hurts so bad
But when it works like it should
There's nothing on earth known to man (like)
The love of a woman
The love of a woman like you
The love of a woman
There's nothing so strong and so true
I prayed to God above
And I've searched my whole life through
For the love of a woman
The love of a woman like you"
"Darling this is my desire, set your little old heart on fire
Do the things that lovers always do
So put your little hand in mine I buy you diamond ring so fine
Then I'll build a bungalow for two
Closer, a little closer
Well there ain't no use to stay so far away
So darling turn on all your charms while I hold you in my arms
Let old Mother Nature have her way
Now my baby take a chance for I'm achin' for romance
And know that you were meant for me to love
You know your heart is beatin' fast, you know I'm gonna win at last
So cuddle up and be my turtle dove
Closer, a little closer
Well there ain't no use to stay so far away
I like to touch your lips to mine like to win your love divine
Let old Mother Nature have her way"
"Like a honybee beatin' on my screen door,
I got a little buzz and my head is sore,
And from the my bed I can feel the sun,
Lord I hear the mornin' come.
Justa creepin'
Creepin', creepin', creepin'.
Shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun,
A flip of a switch,
A thief on the run,
Since the day you left me baby,
I can feel the lonely,
I can hear the crazy.
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Head for the future,
Run from the past,
Hide from the mirror,
And live in a glass,
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers,
Kinda like molasses in a late December.
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Oh, creepin'
Your cocaine kiss and caffeine love,
Run under my skin and into my blood,
That need you back comes over me,
Like ivy crawlin' up a hickory tree.
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Justa creepin' creepin'
Creepin'
Head to the future,
Run from the past,
Hide from the mirror,
And live in a glass,
What dreams forget the whiskey remembers,
Kinda like molasses in a late December.
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Ah, come on!
Break it down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Just last night I saw the light,
At the end of that tunnel on the other side,
Thought I found my way outta this pain,
Only too find your memory train.
Creepin', creepin', creepin', creepin'
Creepin', creepin', creepin', creepin'
Yeah creepin,
Creepin'
Yeah creepin'
Creepin'"
"They say I'm like my daddy always on the roam
I know he love my mama but he couldn't stay at home
I vowed to not be like him but somewhere I went wrong
Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere and the girl I love at home
One of these days I'm gonna quit my wandering
One of these days I'll wander back to you
My sweetheart writes me letters they find me now and then
I've send her funny postcards to show her where I've been
She always writes I love you though we're miles apart
But none of funny postcards can't say what's in my heart
One of these days...
I feel the cold winds blowing blowing up a storm
I go to sleep and I always dream that you're here in my arms
And then a lonesome whistle starts blowin' down the line
Wake up boy my buddy says we're a long way from Caroline
One of these days...
One of these days I'll wander back to you"
"This conversation is going nowhere fast
Like a train on a dead-end track
There is nowhere left to go
Well, I don't really want to drag this out
If you're going to say it, say it now
No need to take it slow
We both know it's over
I don't need a shoulder
Oh, baby, let's just
Say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving, leave it at that
Don't even try to let me down easy
It's pretty clear that you don't need me
Like you did before
What's so hard about the word good-bye
When I already see it in your eyes
So what are you waiting for
Only time can mend this
Why don't we just end it
Oh, baby, let's just
Say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving, leave it at that
Let's just say good-bye and leave it at that
Instead of saying things we can't take back
The more we talk, the harder it gets to really let go
You couldn't fix it even if you tried
So go on and let me cry
You said you're leaving
You said you're leaving
Leave it at that"
"You've got a heart that's broken and a will that's given up
A cynical mind and a soul that's worn and rough
You're a fighter, no one can get the best of you
Don't let 'em stay to close that's why you play every man for a fool
I don't care you can live your life alone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
Tried and tried to chip away your heart of stone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
How are you gonna fall if you don't take that leap
You live in fear, fear of lovin' me
And I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up on you
Because you'll never change and
Givin' your heart away is one thing you won't do
I don't care you can live your life alone
Was only tryin' to show you how to love again
Tried and tried to chip away your heart of stone
was only tryin' to show you how to love again
love again....."
"Heavenly Days
Look at that sky
It could've been rainin'
It could've been dry
It could've been cloudy
It could've been clear
It could've been sunshine
It could've been drear
It could've been so many ways
Heavenly Days
Havenly Days
So what do we do?
Dare to be different
Dare to be true
Bury the treasure
Like we've always done
Or crawl from the wreckage
And walk in the sun
Fannin' the flame 'til it's a blaze
Heavenly Days
Heavenly Days
Look at us now
We're comin' up roses
And takin' a bow
Tennessee tomboy
Feminine girl
Takin' a ride
On the top of the world
Nobody's master
Nobody's slave
Heavenly Days
It's your place in line
It's your right of birth
It's your light to shine
Down on God's green earth
It's your brother's hand
It's your sister's smile
It's your father's plan
For your mother's child
And it's comin' in waves

"Ain't gonna marry in the fall
Ain't gonna marry in the spring
For you're in love
With a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring
[Chorus]
You're just a country boy
Money - have you none?
But you've got silver
In the stars
Gold in the morning sun
Gold in the morning sun
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'll marry you
She'd only turn you down
[Chorus]
Never could afford a store-bought ring
With a sparklin' diamond stone
All you could afford is a loving heart
The only one you own
[Chorus]"
"Words cannot say
What I want them t say
To show how I feel
That my love is real
To hold you my love
Is all I can do
To make you see
You're the world to me
I would climb every mountain
I would sail every sea
There ain't a woman alive who could satisfy
The way you satisfy me
You're the source of my constant joy
And you work so tirelessly
I could never leave and I don't know how
To repay your loyalty"
"I want some red roses for a blue lady
Mister florist take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away
I want some red roses for a blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick,
I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown
(I want some red roses for a blue lady)
We had a silly quarrel the other day
I hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away
I want some red roses for a blue, blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown"

How long has it been
Since you got up on the early side a' mornin'?
And saw the sun a-risin'
Bright an' shiny on the eastern side a' day?
And long will it be
'Til you listen to the sound of evenin' thunder?
And go runnin' through the raindrops
And stop to smell the flowers on the way
How long has it been
Since you heard the leaves a-rustlin' in November?
And felt the autumn wind
Blowin' soft across a sky of sil'vry gray?
And how long will it be
'Til you walk along the riverside together?
And take the time to skip a stone
And stop to watch the ripples fade away
But we're so busy tryin' to make it
Workin' mornin', noon and night
That we never see the sunlight
And anytime we started lookin'
For the little things in life that make it livin'
How long has it been
Since you held your woman in your arms and kissed her?
And told her that you'd love her
'Til the day that heaven takes you both away?
And how long will it be
'Til you wake up late at night and turn to whisper,
""Hon, I promise you tomorrow ain't a-gonna be just another day.""
But we're so busy tryin' to make it
Workin' mornin', noon and night
That we never feel the lovelight
And anytime we started hearin'
All them quiet words that come from up above
We're so busy tryin' to fight it
Drivin' hard to beat the stoplight
That we never see the starlight
And anytime we started lookin'
For the little things in life that make it love
Yeah, the little things in life that make it livin'
Are the little things in life that make it love"
"I know your leavin'
I see the signs
You're gonna walk out on this heart of mine
You'll never call me
You'll never write
You've made your mind up, your gone tonight
If some rainy day you're all alone
You feel like talking, you can log me on
[Chorus]
At www.memory,
I'll be waiting for you patiently
If you feel the need, just click on me
At www.memory
You won't even have to hold me
Or look into my eyes
You can tell me that you love me
Through your keyboard and wires
No, you won't have to touch me
Or even take my hand
Just slide your little mouse around
Until you see it land
[Chorus]
If you feel like love, just click on me
At www.memory"
"I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you got to give, so live and let live or let go
I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
I beg you pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know"
"If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If a thinker was my trade would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made following behind me
Save my love through loneliness save my love through sorrow
I've given you my ownliness come and give me your tomorrow
[ ac.guitar ]
If I worked my hands in wood would you still love me
Answer babe yes I would I would put you above me
If I were a miller at a mill wheel grinding
Would you see it and know my face I'm here for the finding
Now if I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby"
"well, i forget when i began
oh, swimming in the sand
i guess it hit me with a man is just a man
so i tried to get some truth
outta these clothes that i outgrew
i cut my way to the back of the line, and i found you
but i know you don't see me like before
but you'll never catch me walkin' out that door
and i've been living here for years
but there's a stranger in the mirror
well, it's a rat race baby, making money off of what we feared
and to the kids who have some words
about my friends or about her
why don't you step out of the ghetto, say exactly what you learn
'cause we ain't taking their shit anymore
that's why you'll never catch me walkin' out that door
i wanted to be all the things that you adore
i wanted you to see your change
but i ain't them
and i know that
well, you ain't leaving me behind
well, i should step up to the plate
instead of sleep away my days
dreamin' 'bout a time that's long since gone by
here i go again
isolating all my friends
inviting people to my party, but not letting anyone in
and it doesn't seem like it's worth fighting for
so grab your bullshit, i'm showin' you that door"
"I've been bound to leave you,
We've known that for a while.
I'm sure it's something I can't do,
If I can't leave you with a smile.
I don't know how far I'll have to go
Til I'm sure those eyes won't cry.
And in my mind, I've left enough to know
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.
Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.
I'm still bound to leave you,
I surely don't know how.
My heart won't let me put you through
What my mind says should happen now.
I don't know where we'll go from here,
There may be no way to fly.
And the cloud I'm in just makes it all to clear
That I can't leave you with a bad goodbye.
Goodbye
Easier said than done.
Goodbye
There's no good when your the one
Whose goodbye you swore would never come.
And in my goodbye you're finding none.
How can we be so far between
Where we are and one more try?
And any way I look, I've only seen
That I can't leave you with a bad
Goodbye"
"I hit the ground running
With the morning sun
When a job needs doing
I get it done
I show up early and I go home late
Everybody knows I pull my weight
'Cause I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'
Baby I heard he done you wrong
The going got tough and he got gone
Well he ain't here and I ain't him
And even if the walls come falling in
You know I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'
Baby when your heart is achin'
Lean on me, my back ain't breakin'
All I'm sayin'
Is I don't mind doing
A little heavy liftin'
I'm always giving my everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'
Honey I ain't quittin'
I'm always giving my everything
As long as I'm still alive and kickin'
I'll be stickin' to the heavy liftin'"
"(Please baby wait for me wait for me)
I got smashed last night on a bottle of gin and I had a fight with my best girl friend
When I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
But please baby wait for me until they let me out again
I know the same thing has happened before
And everytime it does I hate it more and more
But when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
But please baby wait for me until they let me out again
Spent a whole lotta time sittin' and thinkin'
I guess I spent too much time sittin' and thinkin' bout you
If I didn't spend so much time sittin' and drinkin'
We'd still have the love that we once knew
Oh I won't promise the same thing won't happen again
But I can promise it'll be a long long time till then
Cause when I'm drinkin' I am nobody's friend
Please baby wait for me until they let me out again"
"I couldn't change your heart
I couldn't change your mind
So I just had to learn to live with
This empty life you left behind
You didn't try to hear
You didn't try to see
No, you just stared right
Through the teardrops
Like there was nothing left of me
Nothing but sorrow
Nothing but pain
Nothing but memories that
Whisper your name
Nothing but sadness
Nothing but fear
Nothing but silence is heard
Around here
Bridges were burned, oh
Lessons were learned
Promises made that were broken
Tender lies softly spoken
You didn't try to hear
You didn't try to see
You just stared right
Through the teardrops
Like there was nothing left of me
Nothing but sorrow (nothing but sorrow)
Nothing but pain (nothing)
Nothing but memories that
Whisper your name
Nothing but sadness (nothing but sadness)
Nothing but fear (nothing)
Nothing but silence is heard
Around here, heard around here
Nothing but sorrow (nothing but sorrow)
Nothing but pain (nothing)
Nothing but memories that
Whisper your name, whisper your name
Nothing but sadness (nothing but sadness)
Nothing but fear (nothing)
Nothing but silence is heard
Around here, heard around here
I couldn't change your heart"
"Starting over again is a bit like dancing,
You just need someone to lead and take it slow,
So lay your head on my shoulder,
Let me hold you close, that's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go
Every day is like a new beginning
One door opens, while another starts to close
But just slip your arms around me
Cause life's a dance, don't know
That's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go
I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly
But you gotta try
So just hold on tight
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
You're dancing
There you go
That's it
There you go"
"Baby girl I'm caught up in your heatwave
You're not like the end of June
It's not like you're gonna cool off soon
The spotlight looks good on you
It looks good on you
Shadows heat you like a headdress
Key to my heart on your necklace
Between summer girl and that sundress
I'm sweatin' and I'm reckless
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave
Watch your body move to the beat babe
Feels like we're havin' us a beach day
Lightin' it up while your feet sway
I'm caught up in your heatwave
Heatwave (girl so fine)
Heatwave (girl so fine)
Baby girl I'm caught up in your
Two piece in the water
That's all me, I got her
There's gonna be some lightenin' at the bottom of this bottle
We have drawn our names in the white sand
Call it what it is, I'm the right man
Meltin' ice in your right hand
But I'ma put a rock on your left baby
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up, serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up
Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drive a double shot on your cruisin' light
Midnight sweat, jerky skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heatwave (burnin' up)
Baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You're so south just turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up, serve it up
Baby girl I'm caught up in your"
"Somebody loves you I want you to know
Longs to be near you wherever you go
Somebody loves you and right from the start
Happiness flew into someone's heart
Somebody loves you each hour of the day
When you're around dear or when you're away
Somebody loves you sweetheart can't you see
And that somebody is me
(Somebody loves you)
(Somebody loves you and right from the start)
Gappiness flew into someone's heart
Somebody loves you each hour"
"She said someday I'd understand
What love was all about
She said I could have the kids
She was movin out
Said she'd finally found a man
Who's dick was so much bigger
Then that scumbag motherfucker
Run off with a nigger
And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big, black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A greasy nigger
He treated her just like a queen
She gave him all my money
It looks like the joke's on me
But I don't think it's funny
That pussy ain't worth payin for
As far as I can figure
Cause there's nothing quite as worthless
As a white girl with a nigger
And to think I'd ate the pussy
Where that big, black dick had been
And kissed the lips that sucked him off
Time and time again
It's enough to make a man throw up
Sure is hard to figure
How any decent girl could ever fuck
A God damn nigger
So for all you nigger lovin whores
This song is just for you"
"Lessons learned, bridges burned to the ground,
And it's too late now to put out the fire,
Tables turned, and I'm the one who's burning now,
Well I'm doing alright,
'Til I close my eyes
And then I see your face,
And it's no surprise.
[Chorus]
Just like that I'm crawling back to you,
Just like you said I would yeah,
I swallow my pride,
Now I'm crawling back to you,
I'm out of my head,
Can't wait any longer,
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger,
Just like that, like you said I'd do,
I'm crawling back to you.
Time can heal, but the scars only hide the way you feel,
And it's hard to forget how I left you hanging
On by a thread, when everything is said, I will regret it, yeah,
I was doin' alright, thought I could make it,
Then I see your face and it's hard to fake it.
[Chorus]
If you could find a way, to forgive everything, I know you would.
And I would take it all back, give if only I knew that I could.
Lessons learned, bridges burned to the ground.
And it's too late now, to put out the fire.
[Chorus]
I'm crawling back to you [3x]"
"Gonna jump back on this two lane highway
Set my wheels in motion back to you
I've been gone so long now girl
Your memory's all I've got to see me through
Telephone poles are whizzing by
But that ain't fast enough
Peddle down, flying low, the things we do for love.
Head on , flat out, wide open
Like a freight train out of the blue
Nothin's gonna slow me down
Wound up so tight I'm smoking
Baby just a thinking 'bout you
Nothin's gonna slow me down
Nothin's gonna slow me down
If it rains all night and the creek gets high and the bridge floats by
I'll find my way to you
Baby keep that porch light burning
'Cause we've got lots of catching up to do
The thought of you is driving me right out of control
Ain't nothing getting goin' in my way
'Cause babe I'm coming home
Telephone poles are whizzing by
But that ain't fast enough
Peddle down, flying low, the things we do for love.
No cops, stop signs, red lights
Nothin's gonna slow me down
Pot Holes, Wide loads, who knows
Nothin's gonna slow me down"
"Take my lips and give me yours
Take my arms and give me yours
Take my heart and give me yours
Till we two are one
Just one kiss if we should dare
Just one love for us to share
Just one ecstasy is there
Till we two are one
There could be heavenly dreams
We take and give for
Thrillingly willingly
Moments that we live for
Take my love and give me yours
Take my life and give me yours
Take my soul and give me yours
Till we two are one
[ guitar ]
There could be heavenly...."
"Yeah be my baby let me stay with you I'll be your daddy and your mama too
I'll hug and kiss ye listen that you'll coo if you'll be my baby I'll baby sit with you
If you'll be my baby I don't mean maybe I'll buy you candy pretties too
If you think I'll get ye I'll love and pet ye if you'll be my baby I'll baby sit with you
[ steel ]
If you'll be my pi-pi I'll dress you up real neat I'll read you stories rock you to sleep
I'll never leave you or make you blue if you'll be my baby I'll baby sit with you
If you'll be my baby and mine alone I'll never spank ye or do you wrong
I'll never scold you no matter what you'll do
If you'll be my baby I'll baby sit woth you
Yeah be my baby I don't mean maybe..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Our love affair is bitter sweet
Insecure and incomplete
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed
It's all become so complicated
Maybe you feel obligated
And out of simpathy for me you stay
But I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind
I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind"
"While they dance
How she holds him
Pulls him close
And loves him so
While he dreams of another
And counts the days
Until he lets her go
Same old story
That everybody knows
It's one heart holdin' on
One letting go
While they ride
Lord, he tells her
How they two
Will settle down
But she only hears the highway
And a voice
In some other town
And the harder
He holds her
The more she slips away"
"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you"
"I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, wait to late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine
So, let it show, let it shine
If we have a chance to make one heart of two
I just want to dance with you
[Chorus]
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I caught you looking at me when I looked at you
Yes, I did; ain't that true?
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do
I just want to dance with you
Oh, the boys are playing softly, and the girls are too
So am I, and so are you
If this was a movie, we'd be right on cue
I just want to dance with you
[Chorus]
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
Hold you in my arms once more
That's what they intended dancing for
I just want to dance with you
I just want to dance with you
I just wan to dance with you
I just want to dance with you"
"I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
High sheriff and police are ridin' after me
Ridin' after me, oh, they're ridin' after me
High sheriff and police are ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home
No, Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
'Cause he's been on that chain gang too long
Gotta see my baby, gotta see her bad
Gotta see her bad, oh, I gotta see her bad
Gotta see my baby, gotta see her bad
She's the best friend this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Oh, I feel like I've gotta travel on
Oh, I feel like I've gotta travel on"
"I don't want no strangers footsteps in my bedroom
Pulling down my window shade and messin' up my spread
I don't want nobody fluffing up my pillow
I don't want no stranger sleepin' in my bed.
If I have to cross the world without you
Always keep in mind what I said
I don't want nobody's arms around me.
I don't want no strangers sleepin' in my bed.
I don't want no strangers footsteps in my bedroom
Pulling down my window shade and messin' up my spread
I don't want nobody fluffing up my pillow
I don't want no stranger sleepin' in my bed.
I guess that I still need some reassurance
That keep those cheatin' thoughts out of my mind
And though you never gave me thoughts about you.
Darlin', let me tell you one more time.
I don't want no strangers footsteps in my bedroom
Pulling down my window shade and messin' up my spread
I don't want nobody fluffing up my pillow
I don't want no stranger sleepin' in my bed.
No, I don't want no stranger sleepin' in my bed"
"[Chorus]
Feel like I'm gettin' into something good
Don't want to stop so I'm knocking on wood
I think my streak of bad luck is over
I'm rolling in a field of five leaf clovers
Feel like I'm swingin' on a lucky star
A choir of angels singin' in my heart
I'm smiling like I never thought I could
Feel like I'm gettin' into some kinda something good
I've had some heartaches, I've had some trouble
I've packed my limit of them low down blues
I've had some bad breaks busted my bubble
Eyes under whelmed and over due
But now it's looking like them days are through
[Chorus]
I'm going deeper, I'm gettin' stronger
Never knew fallin' could be so much fun
I'm a believer, My hearts a goner
And every second is second to none
What's even better is its just begun
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm gettin' into some kinda something
Feel like I'm gettin' into some kinda something good"
"There's a foreign movie
Up on your silver screen
Black and white and silent
If you don't count the screams
From where you are sitting
It all seems so real
Everyone who's seen it
Knows the way you feel
Wake up baby dreamer
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Look behind the curtain
Such a beautiful sunrise
Sometimes a flight of fancy
Falls down from the clouds
You don't have to worry
For crying out loud"
"When Mama Cried
( Written by Daron Norwood / Wayne Perry )
I was standing in the hall when they called the doctor in
Almost scared me half to death
When they said ""It's a boy again""
I walked in just in time to see them lay him by her side
And when she looked into my newborn brother's eyes
Mama cried
When I was just a teenage boy a preacher man stopped by
He asked me if I knew the Lord
Said ""If you don't, then tell me why""
I gave my heart to God that day, and then I was baptized
And when I stood up at church to testify
Oh, Mama cried
Chorus:
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
T.H.S. graduation day in 1985
Standing in the high school gym decorated blue and white
And when they called my name out loud
You'd thought someone had died
'Cause when we sang the Alma Mater one last time
Oh Mama cried
Dressed up in our Sunday best, the family gathered 'round
Me and brother standing there with our heads bowed down
Flowers on the alter and a lady dressed in white
And when the preacher said ""Son you can kiss your bride""
Sweet Mama cried
Chorus:
When Mama cried
You could feel the love she felt down deep inside
Through the good times and the bad times of my life
Oh you could see the love she had in her eyes
When Mama cried
When Mama cried"
"There's a pub on the south side of town
Time stands still while there's still wine around
She's the one you let in out of the cold
The one who's neer and always alone
Did she let him go,
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Oh does she even know,
She's the girl with the red balloon?
Keep her glass full of cheap champagne
She will tell of a man with no name
Smoke and mirrors have done her in
She's in love and she won't be again
Oh did she let him go,
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Oh does she even know,
She's the girl with the red balloon?
So lovely
So lonely
Floating away
Oh did she let him go,
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Oh does she even know,
She's the girl with the red balloon?
Oh did she let him go,
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Oh does she even know,
She's the girl with the red balloon?"
"I knew when she blew in she wouldn't stay
Every now and then God makes one that way
A red head, wild child with storms in her eyes
I knew I'd never be the same
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane
She said she was running from her past
And every breath she stole felt like my last
Her kiss told me better get out of here
But I was too far gone to care
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane
Even in blue skies there ain't no forgettin'
Is it any wonder they name 'em after women
That's the thing about a hurricane
She's all lightning and wind and rain
Get too close and you're swept away
Better hold on till it breaks
'Cause it's a hell of a ride if you can just survive the pain
But that's the thing about a hurricane"
"Heard somebody speak her name
They said she was still looking fine
I could feel that same old flame
I once felt when she was mine
Always thought that I was missing something
But I found out much too late
There'll never be another who loved me that way
[Chorus]
I'd like to have that one back
I've never known someone so true
And a love that's pure and sweet
Is what a man should never lose
And if my lips had said I'm sorry
She might have stopped right in her tracks
Now I find my poor heart saying
I'd like to have that one back
I can almost see her standing there
Tears rolling down her face
As she packed away her memories
In that old worn out suit case
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd never open that door
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more
[Chorus]"
"Hold on a minute it ain't time to leave
Tell me how you're feeling one more time
Four long years and I just can't believe
That I'm still yours and you're still mine
While I was gone, yes, I fell in love
Asked around and heard that you did too
Two drunken years and push came to shove
I met love, love left me blue
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
And I'm all right, yeah, I think I'm fine
My savior lives in telephones
And I just dream of you and step outside
Dial up and hope that you're home
You're rising like a sun
That waits up all night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life
Hold on a minute, yeah, I do love you
Sometimes I guess that ain't enough
When I came round again you put me through
And I thank you, oh, so much
Another year, maybe, three or four
Maybe five or six or even more
You'll find another man to take my place
And I'll see you on the good Lord's shores
You're rising like a sun
That pulled the curtain on the night
Coming through the window
To brighten up my life"
"BLINDED
Writers Bill Anderson, Sharon Vaughn, Steve Wariner
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
I didn't mean to stumble and I didn't mean to fall
But it's hard to keep your balance when your running into walls
But there's an explanation baby for the situation I'm in
Chorus:
I am blinded by the light of your love
I don't know where I'm going or which way is up
I've never been lost and liked it so much
I am blinded by the light of your love
It's hard to see a miracle when standing up too close
It's difficult to focus when it's right beneath your nose
Till love makes its correction and determines the direction for me
(I'll be...) Chorus:
I didn't mean to stumble and I didn't mean to fall
But it's hard to keep your balance when your running into walls
But there's an explanation baby for the situation I'm in

"Don't the moon look pretty
Shining down through the trees
Don't that shining moon look pretty, baby
Shining down through the trees
You know I can see my baby
When he can't see me
Yeah, I tiptoe to his window
Just to see my baby snore
I tiptoe to his window
Just to see how sweetie snores
You know it makes me feel like jumping, lord, lord
Through the keyhole in his door
Come crawl up to your window
Let me whisper in your ear
Come on and crawl up to your window, darling
Let me whisper in your ear
You know, I got something to tell you, baby
I don't want that girl around here
... keep her away"
"Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird that has fallen and broke its wing
Terri she puts on her make-up and wonders what promise the new day will bring
Debbie stays home with the baby while I work my hands to the bone
Yeah I make a living they do the giving in a house we've been calling home
Just a house we've been trying to live in just a place we've been calling our own
Me and my wives have been spending our lives in a house we've been calling home
Jessie's the youngest she always needs answers to questions that I just don't know
Terri she can't sit still for a moment she's always in some hurry to go
Debbie's been with me the longest we spend most of our time on the phone
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind for this house we've been calling home
Just a house we've been trying to live in..."
"Baby baby I miss you so very much
It hurts me baby I just gotta I gotta have my baby back
Can't sleep can't eat because I miss my sweet baby sweet
I gotta I just gotta I gotta have my baby back
Alone in a tavern people all around laughing and dancing paintin' the town
Jukebox is playing songs about you songs with memories making me blue
Baby come on home without you baby I just can't go on
I just gotta I just gotta I gotta have my baby back
Alone in a tavern people all around...
I gotta have my baby back"
"Another lonesome morning
Another long lonesome day
You'll have to live without him
The morning seemed to say
Another lonesome morning
You thought you didn't care
But morning breezes find you
Wishing he were there
Come way
Sing this same
Old song
Trying hard to please
And you hear the sounds
That he used to love
Through the rustling of the leaves
Through the rustling of the leaves
Your losing him has taught you
That wanted him to stay
And you now that all another
Lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
Oh, another lonesome day
Is another lonesome day
Is another lonesome day"

"When I was a young boy evening sun went down
Stand off by the railroad tracks
And I'd listen for the sound
Of that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well I'd dream about big cities
And the pleasures I would keep
Long about twelve-thirty through phase of my sleep
I'd hear that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was outward bound
Well now I've been in a couple of places
Seen a couple of things
Whenever I think back in time
My memory rings
With that Kansas City Southern man
That a lonesome sound
Well I'd sit and watch those trains go by
And wish that I was homeward bound
Don't you know how the whistles blows"
"For years we fought the night
With pale and ghostly flames
Some still dream of light
So the sun will rise again
We'll cure our need for wrongs
In cool and measured crime
We'll learn to drift in palm
From our hearts and from our minds
Let us not be faithless
You will meet our needs
A good and gracious wordless
Will lamp unto our feet
For years we've closed our eyes
While rust on reason grows
Feed and clothe our lies
In our hearts we know, yeah, we know
Wisdom lends us all
Cool and steady hand
Steel pressed to my palm
Doesn't make me more a man
So courage for the givers
Do what must be done
To deal out truth and justice
With swift and sober guns
For years you met our thirst
Still deserts we have roamed
We'll be done with dust and dirt
When the ocean calls us home
And fall into the arms
Of a cool and sweet embrace
And under stars and waving palms
Shed our sin like snakes
But time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns
Time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns"
"[Chorus]
All the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes
Are standing stately, in the hall, but will the timely crowd,
that has you laughing loud help you, dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chande-liers
I never did, fit in too well with folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned a way from the love I offered you
[Chorus]
I never did, fit in too well with folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned a way from the love I offered you
I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world
So the stories say
But a paper smile only last awhile
Then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day
[Chorus]"
"Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of a dark, black night.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night,
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All you life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise."
"She smiled and said if you are who I think you are I'd really like to meet you
I laughed and said if you are what I think you are I'd like to meet you too
She said you've taught me lots of things
But I'll bet there's some things that I could teach you
And though you don't know me I sure know you
Cause you are my childhood hero she said
I got all your records I know all your songs
And I got your picture tacked over my bed
And you know I once wrote you a letter she said
And I don't believe that a night that was spent
By a girl with her childhood hero could ever be wrong
A thousand songs a hundred poems and a half half a fifth of Chivas Regal
While my picture on the wall looked down and winked at me as if the bastard knew
And he listened as she whispered hold me close so I can dream about this later
When you've forgotten me I'll remember you
Cause you are my childhood hero..."

They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
Begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I'll have to do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star,
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally"
"She just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody
I've never had any reason to doubt her
As far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eyes
I wonder if she's seein' somebody new
You can't blame a body for lookin'
When there's a world of people out there
But I hope that she's not takin' any closer looks
I tell ya lately frankly I've been scared
Cause she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody
I've got to admit I do some looking too
But she's the only one I love
She still tells me she loves me
But I wonder if my love's enough
Cause she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody
Yeah she just started liking cheatin' songs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody
Yeah I don't know if its the cheatin' she likes
Or just the melody"
"Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
The years burn
Ooh, the years burn
I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me, is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you
Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
The years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
I used to be a little boy
Whoa so old in my shoes
And what I choose that's my voice
Oh what's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me, is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you ohh ohh
The killer in me, is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you
The killer in me, is the killer in you
I send this smile over to you"
"Talk about life, talk about death
Talk about catching every breath
Talk about when, and talk about why!
Talk about do, and talk about don't
Talk about will and talk about won't
Talk about the sweet by and by
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!
Talk about right, and talk about wrong
Talk about trying to get along
Talk about the way it all would be
Talk about now, and talk about then
Talk about everywhere you've been
Talk about being free
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!"
"Now Ebo Walker was born in Kentucky, and raised by his daddy on a hillside farm,
He took up fiddle playing just for fun, that's the last work Ebo Walker done.
Well Ebo Walker left Kentucky
cause Ebo's daddy said durn your hide,
You won't plant corn, and you won't make hay,
you sit on the porch and play that thing all day.
Well Ebo Walker, he walked and he fiddled and he walked and he fiddled and he drank till he died,
But I've heard tell when the winds are down and the moon shines bright, and the leaves are brown,
You can hear old Ebo Walker all around."
"I'm just a country boy
I'm used to starry nights
She's metropolitan
She's used to neon lights
She loves the Gucci scene
I love my own blue jeans
Everybody says she's not my kind
She's a city kind of girl
Says she's only playing with my mind
She's a city kind of girl
I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild
Maybe I'm a crazy boy
But I know when the feeling's right
I got her going fishing now
She's got me climbing higher and higher
She loves to bait my hooks
I love to read her books
Everybody says she's not my kind
She's a city kind of girl
Says she's only playing with my mind
She's a city kind of girl
I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild
I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild"
"I lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
Violent is the motion in my heart
And in my body and mind.
And silent is the feeling
That I lost but I'm determined to find.
And love is but an ocean,
Unrealistic notion,
But I cling to her devotion,
And I let it pull me down to the floor.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found myself on that poor county drive
And found my love in your guard
Oh, Baby would you leave me if you knew
That I was making it up?
And underneath the love
You got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I, it goes on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on."
"Here you are back on my mind where you stay quite a lot
Bringing back all the old memories I thought I'd forgot
I just keep finding you with me and I don't know why
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
I can't believe how you keep hanging on to my mind
Now I know leaving means one goes and one stays behind
I can't escape from you no matter how hard I try
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
Maybe, I should've been watching when you walked away
Maybe, you wouldn't keep turning up day after day
If I'd paid attention I'd know you didn't lie
Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye
Maybe, I should've been listening you said, goodbye"
"[Chorus: ]
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew she'd been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song
He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side
She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar
He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
'Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away
[Chorus: ]
We all cling to
As the years keep rolling on
One single promise
Of a love that's past and gone
And that lonesome valley
We all walk it by ourselves
With the wildwood flower
Is a story we will tell
[Chorus: ]
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
And all we have left of her is a song"
"(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Write me a song about singin'
Write me a song about free
Do a little tune about lovin' and a-livin'
Do it just for me
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Now, write me a song about rivers
Write me a song about trees
Do a little tune about climbin' the mountain
Play it in the key of me
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Lay a little get-down rhythm
Sprinkle in a dash a' soul
Mix it with a little bit a' breakdown country
Plus a lot a' Rock an' roll
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose
Well, write me a song about summer
Write me a song about sun
Do a little tune about good times
Do it just for fun
[Chorus]
But please don't make it a sad song
I don't wanna sing the blues
For god's sakes make it a glad song
I got no time to lose"
"If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there
Just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could pray each night and thank the Lord that all is right
We could we could you and I
When you're in my arms"
"Livin' on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
Could of had him any day
Only let him any day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to gop
There ain't nobody knows"
"Well the sun came up this mornin', my ain't it a beautiful day.
Heard that highway callin', time to be on our way.
Girl I never seen the sun shine brighter, I need you to be my rainbow
Rider.
Your sweet smile can keep all the clouds at bay,
So get up, we can use a holiday.
We're gonna drive up on the mountain, clear up to the timber line.
Sleep out in the moonlight, way up their among the pines.
In a grassy meadow with the stars up above you.
I'm gonna show you how much I love you.
We're gonna leave all our worries and cares behind.
So come on rainbow rider, time to rise and shine.
We've been hangin' around this ole town too long.
Can't you hear that highway callin', the radio is playin' a traveling
Song. come on!!
We'll wake up in the mornin' have coffee at a small cafe,
Find a celebration, and listen to the guitars play.
We're gonna run in the sunshine, dance in the moonlight.
As long as you're with me everything will be just right.
I might stop to pick you a sweet bouquet.
So come on rainbow rider, let's be on our way.
Yeah, we'll go up on the mountain, all the way to the top.
We might just keep on goin' and never stop!"
"Here's the story of a dying man
Told by a friend of mine.
He said that he heard it from a friend of his
Who was a real close friend one time.
One night he chose to choke his wife
Until the light that was there turned cold.
He'd heard some stories 'bout her
From a friend of a friend I'm told.
The continental drift. The continental drift.
Why do you say ""no""
When what you mean is ""yes""?
Why do you say ""never mind""
When it's obvious that you dooooooo?
Yeah, I love you too.
When it's obvious that you dooooooo.
Yeah, I love you too.
Let's hang around and watch
This good man lose his goodness
And leave a trail of misery behind.
I heard he chose to choke his life until the light in it went cold.
I heard it from a friend of a very good friend of mine."

"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again"
"(Got a)
Rock in my shoe, a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy, won't come loose
Rattle and shake, blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
When I was a baby, long ago
Mama would rock me to and fro'
Daddy would play that rock and roll
Hooked me then and never let me go
(Got a)
Rock in my shoe, a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy, won't come loose
Rattle and shake, blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
Couldn't sit still when I was in school
Didn't care much about the golden rule
They called me a rebel, called me a fool
They couldn't see I had a little rock in my shoe
(Got a)
Rock in my shoe, a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy, won't come loose
Rattle and shake, blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe
Now if you got troubles, you got some blues
You think the world's coming down on you
Don't worry honey, here's some news
All you need is a little rock in your shoe

Rock in my shoe, a rock in my shoe
Driving me crazy, won't come loose
Rattle and shake, blowing a fuse
Can't stop got a little rock in my shoe"
"Oh lord, I stand before you
A past I can't deny
A sinner from the old school
Repent before you die
I tried to run
I tried to hide
I tried so hard to stray
But your love has found
Its way around
And grace has paved the way
[Chorus:]
No more to roam
I've found my home
Hallelujah in my heart
I'm not alone
Love walks with me
Hallelujah in my heart
Salvation sweet awaits us
Beyond the shining light
A chance for you and me
To really do it right
And so it goes
You reap what you sow
My oats were wild and green
Now faith has found
Its way around
And does salvation bring
[Chorus:]"
"I Call the Tune
I see you strutting in here girl with one thing on your mind
Your gonna try to get the best of any man you find
Girl keep on walking, walking on past me
I've been around the block a time, I call them like I see
I'm not accusing you of being insincere
Before you say another word let me make it clear
Chorus:
You wanna go, lets go
But we gotta do it my way
Hold on, step back
Hear everything that I say
If you wanna love me, you've gotta give me room
Baby we can dance but I call the tune
I've been down that road before of making compromise
Fallen to the power held behind a lover's eyes
Now that I'm much older, I've gotta take a stand
No amount of beauty's gonna change the way I am
It's not too soon and you may think I'm jumping the gun
Baby you can play for keeps when you don't need anyone
You wanna go, lets go
But we gotta do it my way
Hold on, step back
Hear everything that I say
If you wanna love me, you've gotta give me room
Baby we can dance but I call the tune
You wanna go, lets go
But we gotta do it my way
Hold on, step back
Hear everything that I say
If you wanna love me, you've gotta give me room
Baby we can dance but I call the tune

"I'm sure you've seen me along the highway sleeping bag and guitar on my back
Searching for the things in life that matter thinking that the world was out of act
I'm going back to the girl that I still dream of going back to find the place for me
I found out what life was really made of I'm going back to the man I used to be
[ steel ]
I've lived much too long without direction really don't know what I thought I'd find
But the mountains I've climbed out in the country
I find that they were only in my mind
I'm going back to the girl that I still dream of going back to plant my family tree
I found out what life was really made of I'm going back to the man I used to be"
"You lie in gentle sleep beside me
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing
I take your hand and hold it tightly
Listen
Can you not hear our young hearts beating
I kiss the sleep from your eyes
Your smile is sweeter than the morning
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire
Fire
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning I think it's love
I believe it's love
And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever
I cup my hands to touch your face
Once again I feel your fire
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire

"Look around little darlin' do you know who I am
I'm as much your reflection as I am my own man
You need not to defend love life's the house where we live
We cannot see tomorrow only feel what we give
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
We talk and hear about loneliness
The cold blue hunger of the soul
But if this world has redemptiveness
Why ever should we be somewhere
Where there's nowhere to go
Put your head on my shoulders dry the tears from your eyes
Watch the sun's fadin' ember hear the wind as she cries
Hear the wind as she cries"
"Sweet Lucinda
Look out your window
LA freeway just like the man said
People honking their horns
Pointing guns at your head
Sweet Lucinda
In a land of cotton
You're not forgotten
The Mississippi River just rolls on through
And everybody's wondering what happened to you
In the land of cotton
Down on the delta
Remember your soul
We're waiting just to welcome you back to the fold
Tomorrow comes early
You better get humming
The whole damn town is gonna know that you're coming
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home and give us a thrill
Bring it on home honey send me the bill
Bring it on home to Memphis
Bring it on home to Memphis
Beale Street was jumping the day you were born
W.C. Handy was blowing his horn
From the bluffs to Mud Island
The music grew quiet
Mystery train put a hush on the night
Fireflies made light of the hot summer breeze
And the wind was a whisper through the tops of the trees
Rain started falling
The river grew lazy
Bring it on home child you're making us crazy
We've got hot buttered biscuits
And dewberry pie
White-flour gravy
In an endless supply
Cucumber salad right out of the ground
And cold soda water just to wash it all down
But down on the Delta
Where cotton is king
We only want to treat you like a homecoming queen
Tomorrow comes early
It's never too late
The whole damn town is gonna open the gate"
"Stranger livin' in my house I'm writing this letter to you
There's a few odds and ends in my house that I neglected to do
Take care of the little things I'm depending on you
And love my sweet baby I neglected her too
The garden I planted needs water the house needs paintin' outside
The yard could stand a little mowin' each time that I pass by
Take care of the little things I neglected to do
And love my sweet baby I neglected her too
A washing machine's out of water by the way the car payment's due
As long as my roof's over your head as long as you're wearing my shoes
Take care of the little things I neglected to do
And love my sweet baby I neglected her too
And if my baby gets lonesome and calls my name in the night
Whispers sweet nothings tenderly and gently hold her tight
Take care of the little things I neglected to do
And love my sweet baby I neglected her too
And love my sweet baby I neglected her too"
"You caged the wild man that raged inside me
Took a hell bent cowboy, made his hands sure and steady
But today when you walked out, what was I gonna do?
But reach for the closest thing, I could hold on to
Yeah, I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
A little lime and tequila, as the teardrops fall
And I'm gonna sit here until I chase every memory off
I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
Sittin' in the shadows, as the sun goes down
A little loose change will buy another round
Oh, come tomorrow morning, there'll be a high price to pay
Oh, but that's all right because tonight, I ain't feeling no pain
Yeah, I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt
A little lime and tequila, as the teardrops fall
And I'm gonna sit here until I chase every memory off
I'm taking this heartache with a grain of salt"
"Wise man say
only fools rush in.
But I can't help
falling in love with you.
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
falling in love with you.
Like a river flows,
surely to the sea;
darling so it goes,
some things are meant to be.
Take my hand;
take my whole life, too.
For I can't help,
falling in love with you.
Like a river flows,
surely to the sea;
darling so it goes,
some things are meant to be.
Take my hand;
take my whole life, too.
For I can't help,
falling in love with you.
Yes I can't help
falling in love with you."
"Walkin' away I saw a side of you
That I knew was there all along
And that someday I'd say goodbye to you
'Cause one right can still make two wrong
Not for each other, not from the start
The difference was day and night
My finest hour spent here with you in the dark
Was just before I saw the light
It's the people who want love and the people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin away
Now that I know what I'm tryin' to find
There's only one place it could be
So I'm lookin' ahead, I've stopped lookin' behind
For someone who's lookin' for me"
"She's back in town
Haven't seen her yet
But I know that that won't last
Soon I'll turn around
And be face to face
With a feeling from my past
[Chorus]
She's an old weakness
From a place I fell
She's an old heartache
One that time didn't heal too well
It's an old story
'Bout a love gone wrong
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong
My hands still shake
And my heart still aches
Just knowing she's this close
Those steel blue eyes
And the way she smiles
Are the things I fear the most
[Chorus]
I know the truth is showing
I know I should be going home
[Chorus]
Just an old weakness
Coming on strong"

I'm begging of you please don't take my man

Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do

I'm begging of you please don't take my man

Please don't take him even though you can

The emptiness that gives us strength

"Okay I forgot about the trash
I didn't trim the long hairs on my mustache
I didn't buy you a ring I believe it was back in '93
Alright I admit it I forgot our anniversary
I didn't pick the baby this morning at the nursery
That ain't no big thing but it's a gold star for me
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I'm sorry I was mad for waiting in the truck
It seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
Just to go to Shoney's on a Wednesday night
I read that book you gave me about Mars and Venus
I think it's soaking in but probably need to re-read it
But I can see now what you've been saying is right
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
I got laid off and we're behind on our bills
I can't cross that picket line down at the mill
I may not have money but I've got my pride
Yeah I know Christmas is just around the corner
And all my love can't keep us any warmer
But look at the bright side
We're both still alive
You get tired and disgusted with me
But I can't be just what you want me to be
I still love you and I try real hard
I swear one day you'll have a brand new car
I even asked God to try to help me
He looked down from Heaven and said to tell you please
Just be patient, I'm a work in progress
Oh honey just be patient now
I'm a work in progress"
"If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
Now we can talk all night about the weather
Tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or I could ask what I really want to know
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
The rain can fall so soft against the window
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky
But daddy always told me, ""Don't make small talk""
He said, ""Come on out and say what's on your mind""
So if I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I said you had a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight"
"She's standing at the front door
With a suitcase in her hand
I'm staring down the hallway
Frozen where I stand
She says she doesn't love me anymore
Oh Lord what can I do?
It's gonna take a miracle to make us stay
That's why I'm asking you
So please don't you have a miracle just laying around
One small miracle nobody needs
Send it on down
I'll never make it through this night
Thinking she's with someone else
Please don't you have just one small miracle left
I know I haven't been a saint
And asking you for anything takes nerve
'Cause you've already blessed me with so much more in life than I deserve
But if you can make a blind man see
And change the water into wine
Then surely you can keep her from tearing out this ol' heart of mine
Please don't you have just one small miracle left"
"It's my pleasure just to please you
It's my pleasure and I'm glad to
If you let me make you happy it's my pleasure
It's so easy to adore you every moment living for you
When your sweet lips smile to greet me it's my pleasure
Every little thing I'd do for you it only pleases me when it pleases you
Just to see the smile upon your face only makes me love you more
It's my pleasure to be near you it's my pleasure when I hear you
Say you'll always want me near you for it's my pleasure"
"Honky tonkers don't cry, we ain't allowed
We have to have a good time even when we feel down
And if a tear should fall, it?s gonna land on a smile
Always having a ball, honky tonkers don't cry
Cryin' in a beer is commonplace around here
But when the sun goes down, nobody?s wearing a frown
That's the life that we live every night
That's the way that it is, honky tonkers don't cry
Cryin' in a beer is commonplace around here
But when the sun goes down, nobody?s wearing a frown
That's the life that we live every night
That's the way that it is, honky tonkers don't cry"
"There's
Satellite communications
Long distance
Internet relations
The world's
A little faster every day
I know it's all
Well and good
And I don't embrace it
Like I should
But I wouldn't wanna go
Backwards even if I could
[Chorus]
But I still
Like bologna
On white bread
Now and then
And the sound
Of a whippoorwill
Down a country road
The grass between my toes
And that sunset sinking low
And a good woman's love
To hold me close
I like my 50 inch
HD plasma
Feels like
They just reach out
And grab you
500 channels
At my command
I finally gave in
And got a cell phone
That I hardly
Ever seem to turn on
I guess I never had
That much to say
[Chorus]
I got a laptop
That sits on a desk
I don't use it much
Except to check
On some ol' car
From yesterday
I kinda like
That music thing
You just download 'em
And you can save about
Every song
That's ever been made
But I still
Like bolonga
On white bread
Now and then
And the sound
Of a shovel head
Down a gravel road
The branch
Between my toes
And that sunset
Sinkin' low
And a good woman's love
To hold me close
Well I guess
What I've been
Trying to say
This digital world
Is OK
It makes life better
In a lot of ways
But it can't make
The smell of spring
Or sunshine or lots
Of little things
We take for granted
Every day
[Chorus]
Yeah, bologna
A woman's love
And a good cell phone."
"I can't go to sleep
I've been tossing and turning all night
I can't even eat
I've lost all my appetite
I know what it is
And there's nothing I can do
I've been like this
Since the moment I laid eyes on you
Oh no, not love again
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
Here I go
Oh no, not love again
I know it's too late
To turn my heart around
There's no way to stop
Once you're on love's merry-go-round
The best I can do
Is to hope it all works out right
All I know now is how
I feel in your arms tonight
Oh no, not love again
This can't be happening
You'd think I'd know by now
What I'm getting into
I just can't help myself
This feeling's got me
Feeling out of control
Here I go
Oh no, not love again"
"Did you hear about Stacy Brown (no we didn't but we'd like to)
He had every chick in town (no he didn't but he tried to)
He got looks he got class do anything to get a little lass
Everybody shouts at him as he walks his girlies past
They say everybody got one (everybody got one) everybody got one (everybody got one)
Everybody got one (everybody got one) Stacy Brown got two
Do you know the reason for his success (no we don't so tell us)
They say that he was double blessed (not like those fellas)
They say that Stacy Brown was born just a little bit deformed
That's why his girl friends they all wake up smilin' every morn
Singin' everybody got one (everybody got one)...
Why they're climbin' up the wall (just to get to Stacy)
Young ones run and the old ones crawl (he drives us crazy)
He got two and that's a fact but no one knows where the other one's at
On his elbow on his knee or underneath his hat
Ooh everybody got one (everybody got one)...
He got two yes it's true oh neighbors talkin' my girl friend she's jealous"
"I remember, trying not to stare, the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later, in the front porch light
Taking forty-five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
And I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you,
You were so surprised
There were people around, but I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there and once again,
I thought I loved you then
But now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe, the way I feel about you, girl
Like a river meets the sea,
Stronger than it's ever been.
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
And I can just see you, with a baby on the way
And I can just see you, when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you, girl
We'll look back someday, at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then"
"When my baby holds me I feel so good
I'll never leave her yet I know I should
Though she does wrong I can't say goodbye
Someday these blues will kill me but what a way to die
Tonight I know if I let her go
Just how lonely life would be for me
But I'll let her hurt me let her make me cry
Come on blues and take me what a way to die"
"Everybody says, you let me down
I should be ashamed to take you 'round
Makes no difference what you used to do
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
But together we can find a brighter way
In my heart, I know that you'll come true
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you
All the happiness, I've ever known
Came the day you said, you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe, you've been cheated in the past
And perhaps those memories will always last
Even though, you prove to be untrue
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you"
"Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
Well, I don't know the reason
That you seem to care
About my new heartache
Well, I know it's not fair
But I'd rather hold her
Whenever I can
Than live with the lonely
Of making a stand
Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
Well, I guess I'll be leaving
You won't see me around
Well, I hope I'll be somewhere
But I can't be found
Don't you feel guilty
For something you said
When they find my darling
With that hole in her head
Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again
There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool
I know where she's going
So don't call me a fool"
"I swear you could taste the chicken and tomatoes and the noodles and the marrow bone
But it really wadn't nothin' but some water and potatoes
And the wonderful wonderful soup stone
Hangin' from a string in my momma's kitchen back in the hard time days
Was a little ol' stone bout the size of an apple it was smooth and worn and gray
There wadn't much food in my momma's kitchen so whenever things got tight
Momma'd boil up some water put in the stone say let's have some soup tonight
And I swear you could taste...
It'd been in the family for a whole lotta years so we knew it was a nourishing thing
And I remember momma as he stirred it in the water and we could all hear her sing
It's a magical stone and as long as we got it we'll never have a hungry night
Just add a little love to the wonderful soup stone and everything'll be all right
And I swear you could taste...
So it carried us all through the darkenin' days till finally the sunshine came
And the soup stone started in a gatherin' dust but it hung there just the same
But ever since then Lord the food's been plenty and ever now and then I find
That momma in the kitchen and the wonderful soup stone drifts across my mind
And again I'd taste taste...
We were nourished by the wonderful soup stone oh the wonderful wonderful soup stone"
"The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me
You loved someone else
And you asked me if I could forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you"
"It's just one more day out of my life
Gone for good, gone for good
I keep turning over in my mind
Did I get it right, right this time?
Worry's only ever in your mind
In mine all the time
What I'd give to be a bird in flight
Rapid climb, natural line
Plain as day, choices made
Why can't I let go? I'll always wonder
All this surrounds me. Why do I hunger?
I am a river, forever changing
Struggle is perfect. All that is here is for good
What has happened to the days when I
Would wake and smile like a child?
Every day a precious open book
Yet another chance I always took
But as I watch my complications rise
I realize, I decide
Simple slow and easy is the flow
That moves with grace, this I know
Choices made, plain as day
Why can't I let go? I'll always wonder
All this surrounds me. Why do I hunger?
I am a river, forever changing
Struggle is perfect, all that is here is for good
Now as I let go I sit in wonder
If all this surrounds me, I question my hunger
I am a river, forever changing so
Struggle is perfect and all that is here is for good"
"If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: ""We'd be better off,
""If the whole world was a honky-tonk.""
You could smoke that cigarette,
An' be politically incorrect.
Show off that red 'round your neck:
Not hear a single soul object.
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,
Who is wrong and who is right.
No need for big expensive trials:
Brother, we'd just step outside.
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
Yeah, if you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: ""We'd be better off,
""If the whole world was a honky-tonk.""
Wouldn't have to pay no tax:
Just set a tip jar in the back.
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:
I bet we'd all be in the black,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.
And if you're lookin' love:
Someone to heal that broken heart.
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.
You wouldn't have to go that far.
If the whole world was a honky-tonk,
And it revolved around an old jukebox,
We'd tell our troubles to the Bar,
Over cryin' steel guitars,
And soon, they'd all be gone.
If you asked me what I thought,
I'd say: ""We'd be better off,
""If the whole world was a honky-tonk.""
Life would be a three-chord song,
And the king would be George Jones,
If the whole world was a honky-tonk."
"Old faithful we rode the range together
Old faithful in every kind of weather
When your roundup days are over
There'll be pastures white with clover
For you old faithful pal of mine
Hurry up old fellow cause the moon is yellow tonight
Hurry up old fellow cause the moon is mellow and bright
There's a coyote howlin' to the moon above
So carry me back to the one I love
Hurry up old fellow cause we gotta get home tonight
Old faithful we rode the range together...
For you old faithful pal of mine"
"well, he's a no good for nothing
but she wishes he was good for something
besides his behind looking so fine
in those wragler jeans
well all her friends can't help but stare
at his blue denim derie'er
wish that they were in her boots
if you know what i mean
and it may sound crazy
but those wrangler butts
drive the cowgirls nuts
well he lays around all day long
stays out at night until the break of dawn
comes crawling in dragging
mud across her floor
well she'd love to kick him out
but she can't help but thinking about
all the women who are waiting line
for his 33/34's
and it may sound crazy
but those wrangler butts
it aint healthy if they fit too tight
you know this could hurt a man
by the end of the night
it's a powerful thing
if they fit just right
all the ladies know it's a mighty beautiful sight
well he's never been one for anything
that involves books
he aint got much going for him besides his good looks
you see he always stays in trouble
when it comes down to romance
it aint a joke when they say the boy
survives by the seat of his pants
and it may sound crazy
but those wrangler butts
drive the cowgirls nuts
yes it may sound crazy
but those wrangler butts
drive the cowgirls nuts"
"Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight,
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side, but he's sitting on firmer ground
John says I look at the moon and the stars
These days more often than I look into his eyes
And I can't disagree so I don't say nothing
I just stare on past his face at Venus rising,
Like a shining speck of hope hanging over the horizon
With each passing year that I sit here
That horizon seems to inch just that much nearer
And all that appears on it seems as clear as spit
But if there's on thing in my life
That these years have taught
It's that you can always see it coming
But you can never stop it
Speed River at my feet running low and flat
I'm sitting here burning daylight,
Thinking about the past
And that distance out there
Where the earth meets the sky
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side,
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning
The slightest move and this river mud
Pulls me further down
John's at my side,
But he's not noticing that I'm drowning"
"Damn she hurts the morning after
Drunk on thinking I could have her
Strung her out long like lights on a balcony
Come wasted, she don't care
Tuesday night I had her here
Like beads and feathers, it was heaven her hanging on me
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
Trashed my heart just like these streets
Her perfume's all over me
Just reminded me of a night I can't forget
She paraded me around
Swirled eyes, not I had a crown on my head till she left
Thought she'd stay, but instead
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
She ain't looking for love
No she's just looking for a real good time
And you can't change her weather
She's a hurricane every time
She took me for a ride, hit a new high
Throwing confetti in her green eyes
Trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
She pulled me in a world of wonder
It's a charade trying to love her
It's like trying to save a soul from Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
From Mardi Gras
(Mardi Gras)"
"Missing lovin' cause you're not here to hold me tight
Missing livin' I'd never leave the house at night
Missing you but soon you'll come and all this longing will be true
Missing lovin' missing livin' missing you
I've counted the weeks the days and now the hours
I walked all alone and I talked to the flowers
It hasn't been easy staying home being true
Missing lovin' missing livin' missing you
Missing lovin'...
[ steel ]
Missing lovin' missing livin' missing you"
"I can't make you turn around
And I can't take back what I did
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me
Before you slam that open door
And throw away four good years
Think of everything we used to be
I know you say that you're over me
But I'm askin you, beggin you not to leave
[Chorus]
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
That you could move on
What if you stay
I know right now it's hard to breathe
Hard to think and hard to see
All the reasons we should work it out
It might be easier to go,
But if you walk out, you'll never know
How strong we could be at the end of this
I know that sorry is not enough
But I'll do everything, anything to make it up
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
What if I told you I've changed
Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late
What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away
What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
You could move on
What if you stay
Oooooo
I can't make you turn around
And I can't take back what I did
I wouldn't blame you if you hated me"
"I wonder if this blade ran through someone's side
The blood wiped away to hide
How evil you grandfather was 'fore he died
But war can make monsters out of us all
I'm sure I'd become one if I was called
And then it would be my blade
Here at this yardsale
The guitar I am holding is way out of tune
The neck it is warped and the saddle is through
I wonder if sweet music ever was played
From the hands of a boy to a girl in the shade
From this rickety ghost of a song
Here at this yardsale
A dollar for anything here on this quilt
A price tag for hands from which all things are built
A blanket of voices speak pleasure in shame
Flowers of plastic and fruit of the same
A basket of nothing at all
Here at this yardsale
So if I had the money I'd buy everything
And cover the whole lot with good gasoline
And burn it for all that I care for the past
And rid mother earth of what never should last
And give her the present of ash
Made of a yardsale"
"I listened when they said that things about you
And when they told me I should leave you on the run
And they said just walk right out there's nothing to it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
It seems some people have no feelings at all
For them to break a heart is some sort of fun
Well I'm afraid that's not my way of thinking at all
'Cause it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done
Ever since I left blue tears have fallen
My friends say just forget her dry your eyes
And it sounds quite simple when I hear them say it
But it's the hardest easy thing I've ever tried
It seems some people have no feelings at all
Yes it's the hardest easy thing I've ever done"
"(Dolly Parton)
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won?
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady"
"I'll not let you worry me nor will I shed a tear
For you don't know the meaning of a vow
You're too free with kisses that I used to hold so dear
I loved you once but I don't need you now
Not so long ago you whispered words of love so true
And I believe you meant them until now
Now my eyes are open and my heart is close to you
I loved you once but I don't need you now
[ guitar - steel ]
Once I loved you dearly and I never had a doubt
And my heart would love you it ain't doubt
Fires of love you started now are slowly dying out
I loved you once but I don't need you now
I'll not let you worry me..."
"Well, I have lived a lot and done my part of running 'round
And never did I think I'd let a sweet love get me down
But now I see how wrong I was, you're part of every plan
Perhaps I'll pay but come what may, my heart's at your command
Oh, this aching, breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care, I know what you would do
You'd drop me like the others and go find somebody new
Last night I saw you, darling, in the arms of someone new
And I know that you don't love him, you just want to make me blue
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more
But someday from you, darling, this old heart will lock its door
Oh, this aching, breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care, I know what you would do
You'd drop me like the others and go find somebody new"
"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain.
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.
I'm young, I know but even so
I know a thing or two I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts.
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess,
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, no it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue
Love hurts uh, uh love hurts."
"All aboard
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas Eve
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe
Oh, the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, Santa's sleigh never made it to town
Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then comin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin' sixteen, coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks
When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered 'round
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around
Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then goin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin', sixteen coaches shoutin' ho, ho, ho
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train
Oh yeah, ain't need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Hmm, hmmm, yeah"

"I know that your weed fields need working
And there's just time before the rain starts to fall
But I cannot stay for the harvest
'Cause tonight I'm headin' down south goodbye I'll see you all
I hear there's a while line a hirin' hands out in Texas
So I guess I'll go and brush a well or two
Can you wait until I'm makin' up to get us through the winter
For the days are short and cold and work is scarce
Mhm the fragnance of your hair is in each meadow
And your smile has touched the wind
And as I work my way closer to you it feels so good to be close to home again
When the leaves fall from the trees look out your window oh yeah
And you'll see me coming up the road
Run as fast as you can out to meet me
And throw your arms around me baby cause baby I'm home
I finally got back home home sweet home it's too good to be back home"
"Hurry up now, turn the water into coffee,
Is it there? are you here?
Did you just wake up?
Did you just fuck up?
Indulge my tug. and yer outside, upon the ground
I'll speak to you
Just write it down
Just write it down
Jenny brown sweet beak
Do you need to steal?
Heres a pistol if you do.
We all have got problems
All night and day
Shoot the wall leave the bird alone
Or feed that bird the worm's song
I'll sing to you
Just write it down
Jenny brown sweet beak"
"The signs of life are everywhere
A hope for feeling in the air
Winters gone we're almost there
We're almost there
I love to see the roses bloom
The first thing have to struggle through
Stoney ground but they always do
They always do
Like my heart
They'll soon be opening
But it's probably gonna take
Another spring
And it's alright
Everything in its own time
It's alright
Even this old broken heart of mine
Will find a way
It will be ok
But it's probably gonna take
Another spring
You came till late
The wind to make
Though it's gettin' warmer everyday
We burn the trust
It's on it`s way
It's on it`s way
I should be far
But than I am
I should be there
But then again
I'm just doing the best I can
The best I can
I wanna see those roses more than anything
But I guess it's gonna take
Another spring
And it's alright
Everything in it`s own time
It's alright
Even this old broken heart of mine
Will find a way
It will be ok
But it's probably gonna take
Another spring
And it's alright
Everything in it`s own time
It's alright
Even this old broken heart of mine
Will find a way
It will be ok
But it's probably gonna take
Another spring
Yeah
I guess it's gonna take
Another spring"
"A thousand miles dear a thousand more across the water across the shore
I'll say a prayer dear for your and mine please think of me dear each night at nine
I hold your picture close to my heart it takes your place dear while we're apart
Helps remind me that you're still mine to feel your nearness each night at nine
[ guitar + steel ]
The bugle's playing out goes the light gee but it's lonely these army nights
Please tell kiddies I'm doing fine give them my love dear each night at nine
A thousand miles dear a thousand more..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
And I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road
I found a kingdom deep within
A place dream and to pretend
And to prepare for the world out there
A dream can dress you when you're ragged
Fill you up when hunger's naggin'
I warmed my soul when life was cold
On Paradise Road
Chorus:
Paradise is a state of mind
The sun shines warm and all the time
And the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow
On Paradise Road
A place no one can take from me
A place of everlasting peace
Where dreamers go; It's never closed
Paradise Road
Paradise is a state of mind
Down the road of life and time
And the friends we meet
Make the travlin' sweet
On Paradise Road
Sometimes now when the world is mad
I find that place I've always had
Inside my soul; It's paved in gold
Paradise Road
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
But I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road"

"I'm sad tonight my heart is weary
I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
[Chorus:]
That old rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your love grows even colder
I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me
Although you often said you cared
And now you've gone to find another
Someone who knows the love I shared
[Chorus]
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But I just couldn't hide the sorrow
That lingers in my heart tonight
[Chorus]"
"She came in the door and walked to the bar and I guess my face turned white
I hadn't seen her in a long time and I didn't want to see her tonight
The lady who was sharing the table with me said is that somebody you know
I watched as a stranger bought her a drink and I said you might say so
She's a mistake I made when I was twenty-one
I did a lot of crazy things back when I was young
And I've still got her footprints on my heart and on my mind
She's a mistake I made when I was twenty-one
And twenty-four and twenty-eight and twenty-nine
She thought my heart was a revolving door she came and went as she pleased
For every night I spent in her arms I spent two on my knees
Begging her to stay and live in my world needing her desperately
Look up fool in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me
She's a mistake I made
There's no fool like a young fool I've heard 'em say
But I'm not sure that I'm mature enough to walk away even today
She's a mistake I made"
"Make the world go away
And get it off of my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away
Make the world go away ?
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away"
"THE OLD TRAIL
WRITERS CHARLES JOHN QUARTO, STEVE GILLETTE
There's a new ridge road that cuts the mountain to the bone. Slices through the woods like there ain't nobody home. You wheel on up the valley view. You'll never feel the climb. Oh but I'll take the old trail every time.
The old trail, just mosies right along, moves at the speed of a sweet love song and the wind through the trees carries her own wind chimes. Yeah I'll take the old trail every time.
Lately it seems things vanish by degrees. How soon we forget we made our tree houses out of trees. When we going to realize some reasons just don't rhyme. Yeah I take the old trail every time."
"I know you tried your best to love me
You smiled when your heart told you to weep
You tried to pretend that you were happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You gave the best years of your life, dear
And each precious vow you tried to keep
I love you so much I want you happy
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep
Your heart is yearning for an old love
With new love it's useless to complete
It hurts me to know you are unhappy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep
You know that you are free to go, dear
And don't mind if I start to weep
I know I can never make you happy
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep"
"Now, baby, please don't go
Now, baby, please don't go
Now, baby, please don't go back to New Orleans
You know I love you so, you know I love you so
You got me waiting here
You got me waiting here
Before a ...
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Don't you call my name
Don't you call my name
Well you got me way down here
On a ball and chain
Oh, baby, please don't go
Oh, baby, please don't go"
"I bumped my knee hit a chair
I felt no pain it's like nothings there
Completely numb from outside in
am I even here, have I ever been
Should I be lying somewhere as cold as I can be
With my named carved on a stone in loving memory
Like a ghost searching for the old me
Maybe I died when you left and nobody told me.
I still drive by our favorite place
But all I am is a nameless face
And when I leave all they say as
That he's been gone since you went away
Should I be lying somewhere as cold as I can be
With my named carved on a stone in loving memory
Like a ghost searching for the old me
Maybe I died when you left and nobody told me."
"Billy Dalton staggered on the sidewalk someone said he stumbled and he fell
Six squad cars came screamin' to the rescue hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no tramps like Billy Dalton scaring decent folks like you and me no sirree
Charlie Watson wandered like a stranger showin' he had no means of support
Policeman took a look at Charlies pants cuffs hustled Charlie Watson off to court
Cause the law is for protection of the people rules're rules and any fool can see
We don't need no bums like Charlie Watson
Scaring decent folks like you and me no sirree

Then one day six strapping brave policemen held down Homer Lee and cut his hair

So thank your lucky stars you've got protection walk the line and never mind the cost
And don't wonder who them lawmen were protecting

Reel screamin' large mouth on the line
Georgia breeze whistlin' through the pines
Mama hollerin' y'all let's eat
Yeah, that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now that's music to me
High school football when the home team scores
Little bare feet on a hardwood floor
Hearin' her whisper the kids are asleep
Now that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love
Saturday nights full of Haggard and Whitley
A Sunday morning choir now that's music to me
Soaked in the whiskey and washed in the blood
That's who I am and what I love

"I know I drive you crazy sometimes
I know I throw out words like they were knives
Real sharp knives
I know just how to push your buttons
Sometime I push them all at the same time
Just to mess with your mind
I need a man who will stand up to me when I wanna fight
I need a man who will hold on to me when I wanna cry
I need a man
Someone who just can't wait
To take me home and love me good and strong
All night long
I need a man who wants to be more than just my friend
I need a man who aches for me again and again
And again and again and again
I need a man
I have misgiving and misconceptions
'Til you love me just for who I am
Now I understand
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man who stands up to me when I wanna fight
I need a man who holds on to me when I wanna cry
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man"
"it's been a long dark night
and i've been waiting for the morning
it's been a long hard fight
but i see a brand new day dawning
i've been looking for the sunshine
you know i ain't seen it in so long
everything's gonna work out just fine
everything's gonna be all right
that's been all wrong
(chours)
cause i can see the light of a clear blue morning
i can see the light of a brand new day
i can see the light of a clear blue morning
everything's gonna be all right,it's gonna be ok
it's been a long long time
since i've known the taste of freedom
those clinging vines
that had me bound but i don't need'em
i've been like a captured eagle
you know an eagle's born to fly
and now that i have won my freedom
like an eagle i'm eager for the sky

"Makes no diff'rence now what kind of life fate hands me;
I'll get along without you now, that's plain to see.
I don't care what happens next, for I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.
It was just a year ago when I first met you;
I learned to love you, and I thought you'd love me too.
But that's all in the past, and I'll forget somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.
Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through.
I don't blame myself; I'm sure I can't blame you.
There was something had to happen, and it happened somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now.
After all is said and done, I'll soon forget you,
Although I know that it will be so hard to do.
Let things happen as they will, and I'll get by somehow.
I don't worry 'cause it makes no diff'rence now."
"Arnie's Daddy said he'd take him fishin'
If he'd just dig the bait
He said, ""Get lost, Dad, I'm watchin' mud wrestling
Go jump in the lake
Why don't you take that neighbor girl?
The one that favors our dog""
His dad said, ""Son, she might sink the boat
She weighs more than our hog""
And Arnie said, ""She's got a tackle box
That you'd kill for a Zebco rod and reel
She won the Junior Bass Masters Tourney
And I just ate oatmeal, and I'm afraid I might hurl
Daddy, please, please take the girl""
I'd rather take a cane and then go fishin'
Same limey boy, same large girl
Eleven years with no date
They finally married when they both realized
They'd get a big tax break
One night at the laundrymat washin' underwear
A stranger pulled a water-gun
Arnie soiled another pair and whimpered
""Ain't got no money in my wallet
She's got the credit cards
But they're all run up over the limit
Won't get you very far
And though her hair's up in curls
And she looks like Milton Burle
She ain't wearin' fake pearls
Mister please, please, please take the girl""
Well, she ain't bad
When she gets a couple of coats of
That cold cream on her and a sack over her head
A toothless Arnie, a whale of a woman
Forty years down the tune
One day they found him with a shotgun
Buck-naked on the roof
Doctor's said, ""He's lost his mind
We'll have to take him away""
As they strapped that straight jacket on him
Someone heard him say, he babled out loud
""If you'd lived with her, long as I have
You'd be slap crazy too
She's the one that's really a psycho
More than a few screws loose
She's nutty as a squirrel
Doctor, please, please take the girl""
Get her outta here!
Arnie's Daddy said he'd take him fishin'
If he'd just dig the bait
Is it Tim McGraw or John Anderson
I'm trying to imitate
Sorry Tim"
"I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile I'll be crying and crying's not my style
If they ask you how I took it say I smiled but I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
This town can do without me for a laughing stock
Since she's gone I'm in a funny state of shock
And I'm so troubled I could walk a thousand miles
So I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
If you don't see me living like I did you'll know the coward in me went and hid
Before this same old circle drives me wild I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile
Yes I'll be dropping out of sight for awhile"
"Heartache hurts and you can't move on
Blue skies fade to a gray sky dawn
Trying to find a place in this town
Where you don't feel six feet underground
You're so tired, you're so scared
Defeated by the troubles you can't repair
[Chorus]
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
A sad song to carry you home it wont be long you discover
You recover, yeah you recover
Those dark clouds cant hold much rain
After it falls their gonna blow away
Take those sad eyes, dry those tears
Baby I'm right here yeah I'm right here
[Chorus]
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
When this world comes crashing you don't have to look away
Don't have to give up no don't let the angels play
A sad song to carry you home yeah it won't be long you discover
You recover, yeah you recover
Yeah you recover, yeah you recover"
"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee"
"Darling let's turn back my years and go back to yesterday
Let's pretend that time has stopped and I didn't go away
We had our love to make us happy it wasn't meant to bring us tears
We had our love to make us happy..."
"I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
I'm headin' for the blue horizon where the mountains meet the sky
Gonna saddle up my faithful pinto and wave the boys goodbye
I'll say so long to mom and dad and tell sister not to cry
Cause I'm headin' for the blur horizon where the mountains meet the sky
I'm gonna ride ride ride ride down that dusty trail
To the land of sweet enchantment where hardship don't prevail
When my roundup days are over and I'll say my last goodbye
I'll be up in the blue horizon where the mountains meet the sky"
"I could wait until you're sleeping, you'd never hear me leaving
Go without saying a word
I could write it in a letter; maybe it'd be better
Who knows? It could make it worse
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, either way, I'm damning it straight to Hell
Ten to three, you're half past nine
It'll never be a good time to drop a bombshell
If I did a little drinking, may numb me into thinking
I could tell you face to face
If I harden my heart, I'd tear us apart
So I wouldn't have to carry this weight
Here on my shoulder
I'd tell you it's over 'stead of keeping it to myself
Morning or midnight, it'll never be a good time
To drop a bombshell
I can't love you
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you
I can't love you anymore
Driving through the smoke, out of the ashes
Looking for a place to land
All that I know is I can't go back, so I'm driving fast as I can
Picking up pieces, praying to Jesus
Lord, I'm gonna need your help
It ain't the easy way
There's always a price to pay for dropping a bombshell
Ten to three, you're half past nine
It'll never be a good time"
"While driving down the last four miles of gravel road to home
All the old familiar landmarks seem like long lost friends
As he pulls in to the ranch he see's his mom hangin' out the wash
And dad is ridin' down the old yellow with old smokie
He never realized what a good cook his mom was
I guess he took a lot of things for granite
But for the past year he has been living on blogne burgers and beans
And he thinks he just might stay home for awhile
Well there's a dance in town tonight
And he figures he'll just go in and see some of his old friends
Well he runs into Bill and John and they ask
Where all he's been and about the bulls
Well then from behind him he hears someone call his name
He turns around to see a beautiful young lady
He doesn't recognise him at first but then it dawns on him
This is the same skinny little girl who use to tag along with him back in high school
My how the flowers grow well they danced and talked about things
And somewhere around midnight for the first time in his life
The cowboy realizes he is fallin' in love
And you know what I guess it was bound to happen"
"I live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between 14th Avenue and Main
In the summer heat, the winter's freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go
Got no home sweet home
Into this world, some are bound to roam
And it's long hard road we've known
On the way to home sweet home
People pass by, they don't see me here
And if they do they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there lookin' for a home
For a home
Oh to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday
A kind soul will come along
Help me to find my way back
Where I belong
Back to a home"
"Why will a man go out and cheat what makes temptation so sweet
And it's a shame that neon lights will make a man stay all night
With a girl in a bar down the street
I never meant to be that man but last night I held another's hand
Though her kisses tasted so sweet that's not what made me cheat
So I'll try and explain it if I can
Where where where could I go oh when I needed love you weren't there
And her two open arms offered love sweet and warm where could I go but to her
Please forgive my one mistake and I'd swear it's the last I'll ever make
Let those arms I need the most take me back hold me close
For loving you is a habit I can't break
Where where where could I go oh when you feel the urge to go wrong
The next time I'm tempted when my glass is emptied
Where will I go I'll go home"
"I've lived enough to know that love's not everything you need
God knows I know, there are still so many things you wanna be
I've seen enough to understand the pain your going though
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
It hurts to see the hurt the need,
Your laughter and your light
And try in vain to free the painful secret locked behind your eyes
And I can't even blame for the things, your turning to
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
I've given you the best of everything I had to give
And now there's nothing left for me to leave you,
But my will to live
I hope someday, somebody, somewhere will love you like I do
It's just a shame to know,
I'm not enough for you
Oh, It's just a shame to know
I'm not enough for you"
"I'm back in baby's arms how I've missed those loving arms
I'm back where I belong back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel we never did before
Since we found out how it hurts I'll bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms...
I'm back in baby's arms...
Thought I didn't need his love till he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong and in my baby's arms and I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms...
I'm back in baby's arms..."
"The moment that I looked at you a voice inside of me
Said you'd better guard your heart and love him cautiously
Well, If I'd only listened to the things I heard me say
I'd have still been standing when you took your love away
Tell me baby, was it hard to keep up your charade
Did you mark me from the start as a target to be played
I feel so badly cheated, I don't know what to say
Made it look so easy when you took your love away
I gave to you my inside, I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
The only hope I ever have about you any-more
Is someday, someone comes along to even up the score
You won't see it coming, you'll just look on in dismay
You'll be so blind sided when she takes her love away
I gave to you my inside, I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
I gave to you my inside, I gave to you my heart
I gave to you no reason to tear it all apart
Now I'm diggin' through the rubble of a trust that's been betrayed
You did a lot of damage when you took your love away
Did a lot of damage when you took your love away"
"I saw you walking by her side heard you whisper all those lies
And I couldn't keep from crying
You sang her love songs tenderly words you used to sing to me
And I couldn't keep from crying
Saw you capture all her charms as she nestled in your arms
With your pretty words and ways in your heart she took my place
I stood and watched her steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying
Saw you capture all her charms"
"WE GOT LOVE
You, You got me
We got somethin' everybody else can see
Me, I got you
We got a good thing honey you know we do
Friends, they all know
'cause we can't help but let it show
Smiles, we can't hide
We got somethin' just too good to hold inside

What we've got, there's plenty of
I've got you, you've got me, we got love.

"As long as we've got each other to love and to share
We've got the answer to all our hope and care
As long as we've got each other to have and to hold
The arms of love we'll never let our love grow cold
Life would be so empty without you by my side
The love I feel within me is forever deep and wide
As long as we've got each other there's no reason to fear
The world will pass us by and never leave a tear
[ ac.guitar ]
Life would be so empty..."
"I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard
If I thought it'd do me any good at all
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays
Just to prove my love for you
I remember well the first time that I kissed you
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire fence
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too
And if that ain't enough
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane
Climb Mount Everest on a string
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee
There's nothin' I wouldn't do
If you just say the word I'll catch
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you
I remember well the first time
I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute"
"Once my heart was heavy I was living in sin but then I found Jesus and he took me in
And he saved me saved me and from sin set me free
Yes he saved me cause he loved me yes Jesus saved me
Once I thought I'd never find peace of mind
But I gave my heart to Jesus and he saved this soul of mine
And he saved me...
[ steel ]
So if your heart is burdened I'll tell you what to do
Just put your trust in Jesus and he'll save you too
And he save me..."
"Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man
A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband that's true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
The only home you know is that bar down the street
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife for a home lovin' man.
A'drinkin' and a'dancin', to a honky-tonk band
When you left your lovin' family life
That's right back where you ran
So go on and have your fun
But you won't always look so smart
When someday that lonely barroom
Breaks your honky-tonk heart
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man
No, you'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man...
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home lovin' man"
"There's just no way to tie a river down
No way to hold back the wind
Rain is gonna fall where it wants to fall
And like the sun I'm gonna shine it on again
The only life I've ever known is driftin' a little
Somethin' I've picked up from my dad
Watchin' the sunset from a town he'd never been
Was the only dream he ever had
I guess this way of life rubbed off on me
'Cause when I stay in one place too long
I start to hear the strains of a distant melody
And I'm off to sing that old highway song
There's just no way to tie a river down
No way to hold back the wind
Rain is gonna fall where it wants to fall
And like the sun I'm gonna shine it on again
Once I met a girl in Colorado
And I thought for a chance I'd settled down
But just when I thought I would make it
I was on the highway leadin' out of town
'Cause wonderin' where that long road would take me
Has its own special brand of charm
And it doesn't matter how much I'd like to
I can't stay too long in one pair of arms
There's just no way [unverified]
There's just no way [unverified]"
"TALK TO HER HEART
(Bill Anderson - Jim Weatherly - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Boys we're living in a brave new world
Let me tell you what I've learned about girls
In this age of high tech and state of the art
When it comes to love you've still gotta talk to her heart
She can have a college degree MBA or a PhD
She can be strong and she can be smart
But when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real
You got to tell her how you really do feel
Don't talk about fishin' don't talk about cars
Talk about the moon and talk about the stars
Tell her she's beautiful just talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real...
Well there's been a lot of changes since time began
But nothing's changed between a woman and a man
It's how things were it's how things are
When it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
Yeah when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her"
"Where have all the flowers gone long time passing
Where have all the flowers gone long time ago
Where have all the flowers gone young girls picked them everyone
Oh when will they ever learn oh when will they ever learn
Where have all the young girls gone long time passing
Where have all the young girls gone long time ago
Where have all the young girls gone they've taken husbands everyone
Oh when will they ever learn oh when will they ever learn
Where have all the soldiers gone long time passing
Where have all the soldiers gone long time ago
Where have all the soldiers gone they've gone to graveyards everyone
Oh when will they ever learn oh when will they ever learn
Where have all the flowers gone"
"You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me
[ piano ]
Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together..."
"When my body won't hold me anymore
And it finally lets me free
Will I be ready?
When my feet won't walk another mile
And my lips give their last kiss goodbye
Will my hands be steady?
When I lay down my fears
My hopes and my doubts
The rings on my fingers
And the keys to my house
With no hard feelings
When the sun hangs low in the west
And the light in my chest
Won't be kept held at bay any longer
When the jealousy fades away
And it's ash and dust for cash and lust
And it's just hallelujah
And love in thoughts and love in the words
Love in the songs they sing in the church
And no hard feelings
Lord knows they haven't done
Much good for anyone
Kept me afraid and cold
With so much to have and hold
Mmh
When my body won't hold me anymore
And it finally lets me free
Where will I go?
Will the trade winds take me south
Through Georgia grain or tropical rain
Or snow from the heavens?
Will I join with the ocean blue
Or run into the savior true
And shake hands laughing
And walk through the night
Straight to the light
Holding the love I've known in my life
And no hard feelings
Lord knows they haven't done
Much good for anyone
Kept me afraid and cold
With so much to have and hold
Under the curving sky
I'm finally learning why
It matters for me and you
To say it and mean it too
For life and its loveliness
And all of its ugliness
Good as it's been to me
I have no enemies
I have no enemies
I have no enemies
I have no enemies"
"I've rode lots of horses and I've won a few shows
Ridin' broncs at the big old rodeos
But the dang-dest contraption that I've ever seen
Is that bucket of bots called a bucking machine
The kids they were all lined up to give the thing a go
And when I first saw it, Lord, it looked pretty slow
It jumped and it kicked and then it turned back and twirled
Then I got to thinking I'll give it a whirl
So I pushed through the crowd and I talked to the man
Who had invented this here modified garbage can
I said, ""I'm a twister and one of the best
I'm a wolf of the world, boys, I must confess""
""I'll bet you a hundred"", I said with a grin
""I'll spur it so hard, its sides cave in
And the bolts and the screws hold the dang thing together
Will fall down inside it there and short out its motor""
Well, the man he said, ""Son, I'll take that bet
And I won't turn it on till you think that you're set""
So I got my riggin' and I cinched it on down
Then I said to old Sam, ""Go ahead and turn it on""
Well, it rattled and it groaned then it started to move
I spurred it every jump and, Lord, it felt mighty smooth
The foam rubber was a flyin' right off of its old neck
And the tin underneath it was startin' to crack
I looked at the man and I started to say
""I'll win me that hundred 'fore the end of the day""
Then he grabbed the big ol' lever with a little sly grin
Jammed it up to high gear and locked it right on in
With a snatch and a jerk and a sharp stabbin' pain
I felt like a hobo tied to an old freight train
My head, it went to poppin' and I saw all the stars
The Big Dipper, the Milky Way and the planet they call Mars
The next thing I knew I was right there on the ground
Just about thirty feet away from that laughin' crowd
So I payed up my hundred and I limped on away
And the words the man said I still remember today
So you're a wolf of the world and a real tough twister
Well, listen real close to some good advise, mister
Keep a ridin' them old broncs if you're still feeling mean
But you'd better keep clear of Sam's bucking machine"
"On the Oklahoma shore of that old Red River
I stand right here and curse my pride
That river runs deep
The current is strong
And the woman I love is on the other side
How did the love we made together
Break apart and drift away
Leave me lost and lonely
On this crimson bank
Red River blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire
If that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texas summer sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue
They say everything is bigger
Under that Texas moon
I'll bet my right hand you won't find a bigger fool
She's probably smiling somewhere tonight
In someone else's arms
I'm here dragging the muddy bottom
For pieces of my heart
Red River blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire
If that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texas summer sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue
She said goodbye and now I'm Red River blue"
"I'm hip on happiness high on love
Hooked on a feeling I can't get enough of
It's a sweet I love you note in the pocket of my jeans
Some bubble gum you left for my surprise
It's knowing I can wake you up just to tell you I can't sleep
And the look of love that sparkles in your eyes
I'm hip on happiness high on love
Hooked on a feeling that I try to be worthy of
A giving and a getting back over and above
When your cup of kindness runs over with love
It's a friend ney believing a lie somebody told
A little fella asking God to bless me too
It's a gentle little lady who told me I touched her life
A withered hand thanking me for what I do
I'm hip on happiness...
So if you can't find somebody to sing your love song to
And if you don't like the way you're going home
Change the color of your morning by the way you look at life
It's too late to start all over when it's gone
Get hip on happiness high on love
Hooked on a feeling that you try to be worthy of
Start giving and getting back over and above
Fill your cup with kindness running over with love"
"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The judge said ""Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die""
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones"
"Another place, another time
Another song, another rhyme
Is it so wrong to wish it so?
The seasons come, the seasons go
Another year, another day
So long ago, and far away....
There was a time when we could do anything
With a brown paper bag and piece of string
Go for a ride, we'd put the car-top down
Somehow we'd end up in another town
Funny how things can turn themselves around
There was a time when we could go anywhere
And not have to worry 'bout things when we got there
We used to think the world was doin' fine
Travelin' below that Macon County Line
Funny how people can be so unkind
There was a time when we could be anyone
A time when things were good and life was fun
When I met you, it was my lucky day
Didn't have time to say what I wanted to say
Sure gonna miss you when you go away"
"Boiled peanuts anytime, painted on a plywood sign
Pull to the shoulder and buy a sack
An old man with a dirty face swears they're the best you'll taste
Grows 'em fresh in that red dirt field out back, yeah, that's a fact
Grace is a mechanic's wife and their toe-head boys are her whole life
Sews patches on blue jeans night and day
Never does much for herself, doesn't dream of fame or wealth
Just a ballpark bleacher and a place to pray
Some are called to preach the gospel, string fence in Colorado
Some are born to raise a family
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, but me
I got songs for sale
There's not a lot of tread on my tires, In some spots you can see the wires
Just hope they make it to the next town so I can sing
I'm still learning lots of lessons, I'm still calling it a profession
Travelin' 'round strummin' these guitar strings
Some are good at mending bones, fixing drinks and telephones
Some are born to wear pin stripes on their sleeves
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, but me
I got songs for sale
I see it in a lot of places
I read it in a lot of faces
Some are called to preach the gospel, string fence in Colorado
Some are born to raise a family
Swing a hammer at a nail, haul bricks or carry mail
Go to college, Duke or Yale, and me
Yeah me, I got songs for sale
Yeah, I got songs for sale"
"After the breakup,
I really thought we'd make up.
Give her a little time, I'd be on her mind
And suddenly she'd wake up.
But today if you listen,
Softly off in the distance,
Somewhere across town, you can hear the sound
Of wedding bells ringing.
And there's bird seed on the concrete
And she's waving goodbye
And they're driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone,
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string.
Somewhere in my mind,
I'm the one by her side.
In that backseat, talkin' 'bout the beach
And that honeymoon flight
I play the whole thing out
From the kids to the house
To the future that we always dreamed about
But there's bird seed on the concrete
And back here in reality
She's driving away
And everybody cheerin' them on as the taillights fade
Yeah she's really gone,
I thought someday that would be me
But now she's driving away in that limousine
And I'm holdin' on
Like a tin can on a string"
"[Chorus]
Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm kind of dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sort of foggy 'cause your mine
Remember the first time that I flirted with you, girl
And I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now time has turned the pages, it's the sweetest joke on earth
To wake up every morning by your side
[Chorus]
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me, I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'm gonna love you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will"
"She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he
Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me...
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, who is chosen by she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly,
Could it be he's taking over me...
[Chorus]
She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she ...
Here I go and I don't know why,
I spin so ceaselessly,
'Til I lose my sense of gravity...
[Chorus]
(Oh god I fell for you ...)
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations
What is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms
And whirl on a pane of glass
An fixation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women
(Oh god I fell for you ...)"
"You can't be true dear there's nothing more to say
I trusted you dear hoping we find the way
Your kisses tell me that you and I are through
But I'll keep loving you although you can't be true
[ steel ]
You can't be true dear..."
"If I was a gambler
I tell you what I'd do
I'd quit my gambling
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord, for my Lord
If I was a drunkard
I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord, for my Lord
If I was a preacher
I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching
And I'd work on the building too
I'm a working on building
I'm a working on building
Hallelujah
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord
It's a Holy Ghost building
It's a Holy Ghost building
Hallelujah
It's a Holy Ghost building
For my Lord, for my Lord"

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right"
"November came and went,
Like a summer that I spent,
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.
I returned to my home,
With a heart part made of stone,
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew.
From the east it comes,
Her love and the rising sun,
And I pray each time they come, it's not the last.
You see I've got strong,
I made it through what came along,
But I can't move on for the beauty of the past.
Came across a pretty girl,
For about a month she was my world,
And I held her hand, and swore we'd never part.
I moved on, she stayed behind,
I said I'd call, she said she'd write,
We lost touch the moment I drove off.
I left town like a gambler with,
The sense of cashin' all the chips,
Before I lost them all on a bad deal.
I made believe I was in a race,
Drove ten thousand miles in seven days,
While writing a book called ""Being A Free Man"".
Met more people than the president,
The good times came and the good times went,
And I learned how to ignore my hunger pangs.
I looked ahead to the open road, thought about the people and what they know,
And wrote a book called ""People Don't Know Nothin"".
(no matter what they tell ya, man)
Once I spent my last dime,
And counted the ratio of miles to time,
I looked up to my disdain and my surprise.
I had driven my car around the world,
Ended back in the town with the girl,
So I wrote a book called ""Life in Prison"".
(Volume. 1)
I see that girl every now and then,
And we drink to having such good friends,
And apologize for the way it did not last.
Funny thing that it's all true,
And I'll always love November Blue,
But I turned her down for the beauty of the past.
November came and went,
Like a summer that I spent,
With a no name girl that walked in jelly shoes.
I returned to my home,
With a heart part made of stone,
And I cried all night for a girl I never knew."
"I'm a man of my word I mean what I say
My pledge is my bond that's just my way
When you've made a promise to someone who's gone
Well that's when forever seems a little too long
I'm a man of my word and I made you a vow
I swore that I'd loved you
And I can't change that now
They tell me I'm free to find someone new
I just don't have the heart
Cause I gave mine to you
I said my love would last for all time
And no one would take your place
Well if that promise was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it I'm a man of my word
I'm a man of my word and it's cost me so dear
Cause those words are a prison without you here
And I'll go to my grave with this torch held high
But just once I wish I had told you a lie
I said my love would last,
Yes I'll always love you I'm a man of my word"
"I'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
You left me and you went away you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
Don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome too walking the floor is good for you
Now just keep right on walking and it won't hurt your pride
Remember that I loved you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you"
"Down from the attic in your old things
My new girlfriend has a curious streak
Half lit, in the hall
She's like you
Twenty years ago
Clothes from a case you'd thrown at me
Orange, yellow, red and chartreuse green
Way back in the day
I lost you
Don't tell me here we go again
Seventies girl
Don't come any closer
There's gonna be trouble tonight
You're not staying over
Hey there seventies girl
Never should have told her
You want to be older
Than you were
She was transcendental then
Her beautiful eyes through your rose specs
Way back, in the day
I loved you
Or something like it anyway
Seventies girl
You've been taken over
You never had a cradle to rock
Now you want to go there
Hey there seventies girl
Never should have told her
You want to be older
Than you were
We fell apart
Just like that dress
Then taught ourselves unhappiness
I don't recall much, I confess
But wonder where she's gone
Seventies girl
Don't come any closer
There's gonna be trouble tonight
You're not staying over
Hey there, seventies girl
Never should've showed her
You want to be older
Than you were"
"I can't remember the last time I smiled
But I can tell you it's been a quite a while
I thought I'd never get out of the rain
You gave me shelter now everything's changed
I used to wonder just where it would end
I thought I'd never be happy again
You came along and showed me the way
Now I can feel your love every day
All of a sudden the rain disappeared
I can see sunshine the skies are more clear
There's not a rain cloud for miles around
All of a sudden your love's comin' down
It takes a good love to make the sun shine
Everyone needs love and now I got mine
Now that I found you I'm gonna go on
Even the shadows to walk in the sun
All of a sudden the rain disappeared
All of a sudden the rain disappeared"
"Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow..."
"She's been gone about three years
It's been a long road and a million tears
I'm movin' slow but I'm movin' on
The sweetest memories still remain
The laughter we had and the love that we made
Every night I go to bed alone
With no regrets
A piece of mind
Lived so much time in so little time
I'm so glad when she was here
She was mine
From the day we met
To the night she left
I loved her, no regrets
Well time and fate can be controlled
You play the hand that you're dealt
And the dice that you rolled
And who might of questioned God anyway
Well these days when I look back
I know I'm blessed to be loved like that
I still miss her everyday
With no regrets
A piece of mind
Lived so much time in so little time
I'm so glad when she was here she was mine
From the day we met
To the night she left
I loved her, no regrets
From the day we met
To the night she left
I loved her, no regrets
No regrets
I loved her
With no regrets"
"Rolling down a long highway
Out through New Mexico
Drifting down to Santa Fe
To ride a bull in a rodeo
He's hooked on a feelin'
Addicted to a natural high
Don't know why it's a feelin'
All he knows is he's got to ride
[Chorus]
He's addicted to danger
Rule out passion and pride
To pain and fear is no stranger
When his lust needs to be satisfied
Hooked on a eight-second ride
Getting up down in back of the chutes
Makes that rosin burn
Got his spurs on the heels of his boots
He's at the point of no return
Climbing over that chute gate
He settles down inside
The tensions risin' but he can't wait
'Till they turn that bull outside
[Chorus]"
"I been workin' my job like a dog all week

so if you're like me, set your horses free, and let that cowboy out
Saddle up, we'll ride in to town

saddle up, saddle up, oh saddle up, aww saddle up"
"I know I shouldn't love you
from the way we said goodbye
And I know there are others
with tears for you still in their eyes
But if I thought you were lonely
I wouldn't waste any time
I'd be the first fool in line
Funny thing about a memory
when it comes to love
It forgets all the bad times
and remembers what it wants
so if you're looking
for a heart whose love is blind
I'll be the first fool in line
I'll fall back into your arms again
Just as fast as the fool I was back then
I know I should know better
i know the hurt I'll find
But I'll be the first fool in line
I'll fall back into your arms again
Just as fast as the fool I was back then
So if ever you are lookin'
for a heart whose love is blind
But I'll be the first fool in line"
"I ain't going to work, ain't going to class
Going bare feet and kickin' back
Gonna pacify my lazy bones ambition
Chillin'
I'm talkin', jet skis and inner tubes
Pretty girls with big ol' blue eyes
And wet t-shirts on the river
Just chillin'
Beatin' the heat of living
Drink to drink
Soaking up every minute

Got my I don't care ducks in a row
It ain't no crime to kill a little time
Chillin'
Good ol' boys sitting on a rock
Passing a jar and an old flat top singin'
Seeger, Cash, Bo Diddley and Bob Dylan
Just a chillin'
Moon comes up and the sun goes down
Under Candy Fort Bridge they're hangin' out
Bunch of happy-go-luckies, skinny dippin'

"I came to hear the music, I came to hear the sound
The music, God knows it brings me down
A long, long road from now to then
I know your song, sing it again
'Cause there's so many things I don't believe I understand
How the days turn into weeks, turn into months
The year's become a moment in the ever changing sand
Did God make time to keep it all from happening at once? All at once
I came to love the music before I came to be
To know the music before it came to me
A long, long time ago, I don't know when
We sang a song along with the wind
And there's so many things I don't believe I'll understand
Why the days turn into weeks, turn into months?
And the year's become a moment in the ever changing sand
Yes, God made time to keep it all from happening at once, all at once"
"Hey Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me some lonesome as sad as you can

Play me a song that will bring on the tears
Make me remember those beautiful years
Play me a picture of her if you can
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man

Cry like a whippoorwill lost in the gloom
I love her I miss her don't you understand

"Sometimes I feel like my life spills into the ocean
And all I can do is watch it wash away
And sometimes, I'm the lighthouse standing on the shore line
Guiding all the sailors through the rain
Yeah, you shattered my heart
Yeah, I should really fall apart
But I'm strong tonight
I'm the stones that keep the river wide
A straight and steady light that shines
You can't cover me up, you can't keep me down
I'm strong tonight
I can hold my head up high
Tomorrow tears will take their flight
But I'm strong, I'm strong tonight
Sometimes I feel like I'm the girl out at the party
Too afraid to look up from her drink
But right now, I'm the dancer moving with the music
So free I don't even have to think
I'm taking it out on the town
Turning it up before I come down
But I'm strong tonight
I'm the stones that keep the river wide
A straight and steady light that shines
You can't cover me up, you can't keep me down
I'm strong tonight
I can hold my head up high
Tomorrow tears will take their flight
But I'm strong, I'm strong tonight
I can re-invent myself or live inside a living hell
Either way I'll do it well without you or anyone else
I'm strong
Yeah, I'm strong
Yeah, I'm strong tonight
I can hold my head up high
Tomorrow tears will take their flight
But I'm strong, I'm strong
Yeah, I'm strong tonight"
"Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my heart as a token when return it was broken
Hide your face shame on you
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took my car and my money tell you girl that ain't funny
Darn your hide shame on you

Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Ran around with other guys and and try to lie when I got wise
Foolish girl shame on you
Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Took and play your little game you'll find out who was to blame
Hide your face shame on you

Shame shame on you shame shame on you
Can you hold your head up high look your friends right in the eyes
No you can't shame on you no no no shame on you"
"Tis sweet to be remembered on a bright or gloomy day
Tis sweet to be remembered by a dear one far away
Tis sweet to be remembered remembered remembered
Tis sweet to be remembered when you are far away
As I travel on this world just to soothe my rovin' mind
The messages I get from a dear one left behind
They were filled with sweetest words that's so touchely when I heard
Never ever can I forget these are some things that she said
Tis sweet to be remembered"
"All I can do is try to drink you in
And do my best
To soak up all that sugar from your skin
But then you had to go and kiss me
You made me fall a little bit harder in this age
You gonna have to miss me
Oh, what do you got to do for your lips
Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Just a taste
I'd love to run my fingers through your hair
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I needed
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips
Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Now all I do
Is think about you all the time
But let me show you
That you never felt a love like mine
No you never felt a love like mine
All you left me was
Your lips pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste, yeah
Just a taste, yeah
Back in my mind all the time
Just a taste
So good oh that sugar from your skin
Oh, I gotta drink you in
Oh, let me drink you in
Just a taste"
"When I try to go to sleep and know
That I won't lie awake and cry then I'll be over you
When I wake up in the morning and I find
That you're not on my mind then I'll be over you
If the time should arrive when I feel alive once again
When each beat of my heart says it's time to start giving in
When I close my eyes in someone's warm embrace
And I don't see your face then I'll be over you
When I don't see your face then I'll be over you"
"I'd rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than have you say you're sorry that we are apart
I'd rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than to be in your arms but never in your heart
Well I've just received your letter you asked me to come home
You say you're sorry that you went away
This is an old old story and I've heard it all before
So darlin' this is all that I can say
I tried so hard my darlin' to make you love me then
'Cause you would always leave me here alone
And although I could forgive you things would be the same
Nothing could ever change your heart of stone"
"The clickety sound of the southbound freight
And the high speed hum of a passenger train
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
The sound of a whistle at the crossin' road
And the tanks and the trucks and the tractors on the flatcar load
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
And the big round penny that you lay on the rails
And the wheels mash flat
And a glimpse of the faces of the ladies
And the picture of the men in the engineer's hat
And the brakeman waves from the red caboose
He's a part of the past, never quite turns loose
It's a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
And the big round penny that you lay on the rails
And the wheels mash flat
And a glimpse of the faces of the ladies
And the picture of the men in the engineer's hat
And the brakeman waves from the red caboose
He's a part of the past, never quite turns loose
It's a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line
The clickety sound of the southbound freight
And the high speed hum of a passenger train
Becomes a part of the soul and a heart and the mind
Of a boy who's raised by the railroad line"
"As soon as you found out that he was out of town
You thought that just for old time sake you could come around
One look in your eye tells me that you came to bring shame into our home
With heaven my witness I want you to write something down
You couldn't even light his candle
Or strike the match that's started the fire that's burning just for him
I'm his and only his to touch or handle and you couldn't even light his candle
You couldn't even light his candle"
"Dear John oh how I hate to write dear John I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John
I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me
He handed me a letter and I was just as happy as I could be
Cause the fighting was all over and the battles have all been won
But then I opened up the letter and that started dear John
Won't you please send back my picture my husband wants it now
When I tell you who I'm wedding you won't care dear anyhow
And it hurts me so to tell you that my love for you has gone
But tonight I wed your brother dear John
And tonight I wed another dear John"
"You sure know how to get to me
Somehow you just wont let it be
We both know it's all in vain
But you keep coming round again
The many days & nights we've tried
But every time somebody's cried
And every time should be the end
But you keep coming round again
Beats any I ever saw
'Cause I know how its gonna go but it just keeps going
I guess I keep thinking well, maybe you're not stringing me on
But if you are that string sure has been long
There's something there within your eyes
That somehow seems to paralyze
And like before I never went
You keep coming round again"
"In a bar in Acuna called Ma Crosby's
I found myself not feeling any pain
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom
She said she'd only come to catch a train
We struck up some idle conversation
Traded all the troubles on our minds
One thing led to another in the evening
And I fell in love again for my last time
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason
That I fell in love again for my last time
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell
I felt all the pains of a morning after
And all alone as far as I could tell"
"WHAT IS LIFE WITHOUT LOVE
Writers Eddy Arnold, Vic McAlpin, Owen Bradley
What is life without love
What is love without you
Why dream if they never come true
Why try to go on
When your only hopes are gone
Darlin', what is life without love?
Somehow I can't forget
The first day that we met
You were something from heaven above
Now I'm asking you sweetheart
And it's straight from my heart
Darlin', what is life without love?
All alone how I yearn
That someday you'll return
And be true as the stars up above
If you'll only say you'll try
Then I'll be satisfied
Darlin', what is life without love?
What is life without love
What is love without you
Why dream if they never come true
Why try to go on
When your only hopes are gone
Darlin' what is life without love?"
"My driftin' mem'ry goes back to the spring of '43
When I was just a child in mama's arms
My daddy plowed the ground and prayed that some day we could leave
This run down mortaged Oklahoma farm
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my mama
That he finally saved enough for us to go
California was his dream a paradise wall he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so
California cottonfields
Where labor camps were full of worried men with broken dreams
California cottonfields was as close to wealth as daddy ever came
Almost everything we had was sold or left behind
From daddy's plow and the fruit that mama canned
Some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell
But some just came to shake my daddy's hand
The Model A was loaded down and California bound
And a change of luck was just four days away
But the only change that I remember seeing for my daddy
Was when his dark hair had turned to silver gray
California cottonfields
California cottonfields"
"I came here looking for something I couldn't find anywhere else
Well I don't wanna be nobody just want a chance to be myself
I've done a thousand miles of thumbin' yes I've worn blisters on my heels
Tryin' to find me something better on the streets of Bakersfield
You don't know me but you don't like me you say you careless how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me ever walked the streets of Bakerfield
[ guitar ]
Spent some time in San Francisco spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell I took fifteen dollars from that man
I left him my watch and my old house key I don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as he was sleeping and I headed out for Bakersfield
You don't know me...
How many of you that sit and judge me ever walked the streets of Bakerfield"
"Mother red river she wind like a copperhead
Coils and boils over dennison dam
Little white houses, eggs on the rocky bed
I am the sun of the serpent, I am
Raised on the river, washed in the blood
Blood run thickerthan bottomland muc
And the wheel sinks deeper as the years spin 'round
Thirty bad summers in tillman county
My uncle little tree dreams of another life
Coddles his cattle and he rents his range
Holds the fan to the face of his pretty wife
She knows nothing ain't ever gonna change, she was
Raised on the river
Daylight's dragon fenceline keeps me working in this trance
Poundin down the bedrock with this rusty lance
We don't stand a chance
Chikasha trickster call to the funnel cloud
Demon come screamin over Wichita falls
Lines down, power out, ryan and points south
Time and direction don't matter all when you're
Raised on the river
Maybe old moses come and turn this current back
Cross me over ever holy and dry
Climb me a crooked oak, scar-faced, bible-black
Swing this shovel till it cracks the sky, I was
Raised on the river"
"Anything new gets old except my love for you
It goes on and on it's forever true
I'll forever love you, oh, my whole life through
Anything new gets old except my love for you
Anything new gets old except the way you smile
The tenderness of every kiss and those pretty blue eyes
I'll forever love you, there'll be no one new
Anything new gets old except my love for you
You're the only good thing to me
Goodbye to the blues and misery
No more lonely nights being so blue
No more lonely hours without you
Anything new gets old [unverified]"
"I had the key to heaven when we married and for a while I brought you happiness
But now your love for me is dead and buried
And every night you share another's kiss
And I'd rather be the one you slip around with
And be the one who's dream of love is gone
I'd rather be the one you spend your time with than be the one at home all alone
[ steel - fiddle ]
Deep down inside I know that I should leave you
How many tears was fallen before I learn
I think of many ways that I could grieve you and yet I'm always here when you return
And I'd rather be the one..."
"Your world was so different from mine, don't you see?
We just couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
And my world could never fit in, I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide
Your world was made up of things sweet and good
And my world could never fit in, I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh how they've cried
That's what happens when two worlds collide"
"She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's: ""I want a piece of chocolate.""
""Take me to a movie.""
She's: ""I can't find a thing to wear.""
Now and then she's moody
She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her
I go on and on, and on
'Cause she's everything to me
She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy
She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her
I go on and on, and on
'Cause she's everything to me"
"It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow but baby I ate it
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes and tell me that you're sorry
Well you might as well throw gasoline on a fire
The way you lie
You lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
And you lie like a cooped up dog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys and baby I believed you
So why you lookin' so nervous
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now and do the whole wide world a service
Well my daddy's gonna straighten you out like a piece of wire, like a piece of wire
The way you lie
You lie like the man with the slick black hair who sold me that Ford
And you lie like a pine tree in the back yard after last month's storm
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive until the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm gonna cry well maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
And give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
There it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
You lie like a coondog basking in the sunshine on my porch
Well you lie like a penny in the parking lot at the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie
Well it's what you do, it's who you are"
"When you came to me
You said love could not erase
The ever present memory of another face
I tried to make you love me
How I could I be so blind
To think I'd be the one to change your mind
[Chorus]
And if I'm gone before you start
Well you can find me in your heart
Who can say if its right wrong
I've waited for you too long
And if I can't hold on
I'm Gone
When you came to me
I said love will find a way
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay
I guess you couldn't see
As the shadow's in the night
It seems the time for us just wasn't right
[Chorus]"
"Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary
I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me
I wonder where you are tonight
That old rain is cold and slowly falling
Upon my window pane tonight
And though your heart was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
That lingers in my heart tonight
That old rain is cold and slowly falling"
"It's deeper than the ocean and higher than the sky
Longer than the highways that we travel by
Truer than the stars that shine in the sky my everlastin' love for you will never die
Well it's sweeter than the flowers that bloom in the spring
Prettier than water in a mountain stream
Brighter than the sun that shines on high my everlastin' love for you will never die
If you would listen to the reason you would know I'm not a teasin'
You'll know what I say is true
You'll know I'm not a fakin' when I say my heart's a breakin'
With love I have for you
Well it's deeper than the ocean...

If you would listen to the reason...
Well it's deeper than the ocean..."
"Hello walls (hello hello) how things go for you today
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls I'll keep you company
Hello window (hello hello) well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned
Yes we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling (hello hello) I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me awhile
We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long long time (hello hello)"
"Stay away from me, you're causing me trouble
It's been that way, since from the start
Go on your way, you have another waiting
Stay away from me, you're breaking my heart
Oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
And autumn leaves have turned to brown
I loved you so, but I can't have you
Stay away from me, stay out of town
Oh the sky is blue, and the sun is shinning
And autumn leaves have turned to brown
I loved you so, but I can't have you
Stay away from me, stay out of town
Stay away from me, stay out of town"
"Like Strangers, that's what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far
Like Strangers, how can it be
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly
I love you, truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
Like Strangers, that's what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far
Like Strangers, how can it be
Only days ago, we loved so tenderly
I love you, truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Let's forget that we've been angry
Let's be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymore"
"We had promised to be wed when we said goodbye that night
While the moon and stars were shining from the sky
For our hearts were full of joy and the future looked so bright
I never thought that we were sayin' our last goodbye
I was only leaving you for just a little while
To find a home where we'd be happy by and by
Then you kissed me with a smile and you said you'll wait for me
I never thought that we were sayin' our last goodbye
It was only one short year till I found a little place
And started back to you to hear your happy sigh
I was thinking only of the smile upon your face
I never thought that we had said our last goodbye
All the story that was told when I knocked upon your door
Broke my heart in two and how it made me cry
For that told me you had gone and didn't love me anymore
Then I knew that we had said our last goodbye"
"Hello darlin', nice to see you it's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be
How's your new love, are you happy, hope you're doing fine
Just to know this means so much to me
What's that darlin', how am I doing, guess I'm doing all right
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up darlin', let me kiss you just for old time sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time
Thank you darlin', may God bless you and may each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find
Goodbye darlin', gotta go now, gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back darlin' I'll be waiting for you"

Verse 1:
When I was down in that old jailhouse my friends just walked on by.
Nobody came round to see about me an I couldnt help but wonder why.

"I've been through hell and half of louisiana
Lookin' for a man like you
I know you could have any woman you want
And I know you've had a few
I know I've got some stiff competition
They ain't got nothin' on me
'cause I've got something that you've been missin'
I practice what I preach
Chorus:
'cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun
'cause there's more where that came from
There's more where that came from
And I want your clothes in my closet
My name on your mail
And I want my love to be your faucet
Drinkin' from an endless well
I want your kids to call me mama
I want you to call me hun
I wanna be the one you love and honor
When it's all been said and done
Chorus:
'cause I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
And I wanna be your full-time woman
Closer than your kin
I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun

That's right, there's more where that came from
2nd chorus:
Oh, I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your full-time woman
I'm gonna get under your skin
'cause I wanna be your satisfaction
Be your number one
And just when you think I can't love you any better
Well, I have just begun
There's more where that came from
That's right, there's more where that came from
Tag:
Yes, I wanna be your full-time woman
I wanna be that, I wanna be that
Oh, I wanna be your lover, lover, lover
I wanna be that, I wanna be that
And I wanna be your satisfaction
I wanna be that, I wanna be that"
"Like a mile wide tornado,
Coming through the Mid-West.
She walked into my scene,
And you know the rest.
I heard she never got those letters that I sent,
I got a few from her, wonderin' how she'd been. She said,
""Babe, I always kinda liked the way you talked.
How you'd give away the gold like it was any other rock.""
Chorus:
Maria, how you come around and throw your bad advice at me,
But you're upon a pedestal, sparks and electricity.
Maria, I could settle down, and I need you desperately,
But I can never get enough, of these things that are killing me.
hey
Once upon an idea, I loved the girls like you,
The sleepless nights and blown out fights, they were funny too.
But then she laid her charm, it always would wear off,
The price I paid always outwieghed any other costs.
""Aw, but, babe, I always kinda liked the way you talked.
How you'd give away the gold like it was any other rock.""
Chorus
You know she's just a little girl,
but, she's uncontrolling wave,
The harder you swim against it, the further you end up out at sea.
Chorus
No, i can never get enough, of these things that are killing me.
Hey"
"Sugar coated love, you gave me on a plate
I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can't bite
You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can't understand what I saw in a sugar coated love
You called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
You sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love"
"I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
You know I never did make my fortune and I guess it's a little late now
But I never did worry about that much
No shoot I was happy anyhow cause you see
As I have journeyed down life's road
I have reaped a lot more than I've sowed
And I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has over flowed
No I'm not a man of riches
No sir and sometimes the going gets kinda' rough
But I got me a good family an old horse and a dog
They all love me well that makes me rich enough
I thank the Lord for all these bless the mercies he has bestowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Oh I've had lots of times when it seemed everything went wrong
I could feel my faith get well just a little bit thin
But the rain would stop and dark clouds would roll away
The sun would come shining right back down in my life again
So Lord don't let me gripe too much about the rough row I've hoed
cause I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
And now Lord if you can just give me the strength I need
And the courage when that old road gets steep and rough
I'll not ask for any other blessing cause I have been blessed more than enough
And Lord don't ever let me get so busy that I can't help another with his load
And I just keep on drinking from my saucer cause my cup has surely overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Thanks Lord"
"I've seen people everywhere who said they didn't care
If life for them would come to an end and they just sit and stare
I've thought it was a shame I said they were insane
I couldn't see why they wanted to die but I didn't know the pain
I wonder what I'd say if my life turn out that way
I never knew but now I do I lost my love today
I lost my love today I lost my love today
I can't go on my heart is gone I lost my love today"
"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you"
"For years we both have lived on pride, dear
And we agree that love is gone
Why, oh, why do we keep trying?
A house without love is not a home
The love light in your eyes has faded
And I'm contented just to roam
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
A house without love is not a home
No matter where our footsteps wander
I know we'll both be all alone
With the pride that came between us
A house without love is not a home
The simple things have gone forever
We wasted wealth to call our own
Now we've reached the hour of parting
A house without love is not a home"
"By your side satisfied
Through and through cause I was born to be with you
Wondrously love can see
So I knew that I was born to be with you
Do I find peace of mind
Yes I do cause I was born to be with you
All life through yes I was born to be with you"
"Now after loving you what else is there to do
Cause darling all the rest will just be second best
I know I'll go tonight comparing them to you
I'll be no good to anyone after loving you
Your love can't be replaced with just another pretty face
And heartaches will remain for they can't re-eraze
Many loves may come along but they won't live up to you
I'll be no good to anyone after loving you"
"Way up in the north in old Tyrone
There's a pretty little girl I call my own
She's the sweetest rose Ireland's ever grown
And sure as the moon and stars above
I'm falling head over heels in love
With a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
There's cute little girls in old Strabane
They're just as pretty in Monaghan
This to every roving eye is known
But I guess that I'd be out of bounds
'Cos there between the northern towns
There's a pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me, oh lucky me.
Well I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
--- Instrumental ---
T'was down in south in old Tramore
I recall the yellow dress she wore
She strolled along the shore there all alone
But I guess it was my lucky day
When she came there on holiday
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
She wears my ring and tells her friends
She going to marry me
Best of all she tells them all
She's going to marry me, oh lucky me.
Well, I don't know what she's done to me
There's nothing else my eyes can see
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone.
My pretty little girl from Omagh
In the county of Tyrone..."
"(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick/Tommy Simms)
You don't have to cry when I say good-bye, good-bye
You know I'll be coming back real soon
And when I do, you know
It will be such a sweet hello
Rising like the sun above the sky line, sky line
Love is brighter than ever before
And that should be understood
When is said I do you knew I would
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Let me lay your head upon my pillow, baby
Whisper what you need to me, my dear (my dear)
Don't worry, close your eyes
Morning will find me by your side
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Give me a chance and I'll sing for you
I have a song for you
To be with you is a dream
I dream of you
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so"
"I wish the world could feel what we both know is real
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
You are my dream to share my every hope and care
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
Your love unveiled the world I'd never known before
When your love fooled inside I softly closed the door
Your heart is tuned with mine in harmony they rhyme
Sweetheart you'll always be my ecstasy
[ ac.guitar ]
Your love unveiled..."
"Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Makin that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand
There ain't no lettin' up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin'
She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones
No doubt about it that girl's country strong
Cowboy's, plowboys, good hearted women
They're all country strong"
"He wears a Harley Jacket and a kiss me smile.
Through his steel blue eyes I can see for miles.
He digs big band music and the Rolling Stones.
But we listen to country when we're all alone.
Cause it makes me crazy.
It drives me wild.
I like my lovin' country style.
Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin our way.
Sittin' right beside him.
Hell-bent, holdin' on.
Flippin' through the stations.
Lookin' for a fast song.
Singin' along with the ones we know.
Listenin' to the radio.
Well, we stop for gas, but not for long.
Cause that Philco radio keeps us movin' on.
He floors that '66 Mustang, rag top 289.
While I blow him kisses from the passenger side.
Cause it makes him crazy.
It drives him wild.
He likes his lovin' country style.
Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.
Wind's goin our way.
Sittin' right beside him.
Hell-bent, holdin' on.
Flippin' through the stations.
Lookin' for a fast song.
Singin' along with the ones we know.
Listenin' to the radio.
Listenin' to the radio.
I slide on over when the song slows down.
I give him all my love to throw his arms around.
We're so in love we never touch the ground.
Blastin' through the wind in a wall of sound.
Well, we're listenin' to the radio.
Flyin' down the highway.
Feelin' like outlaws.

"They just don't make love like they used to they stone a heart that's warm and true
It seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
Love just don't hold on like it used to it dies before it's halfway through
And it seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
I remember when I loved you meant all the world
They just don't make love like they used to
[ strings ]
It seems to fall apart no matter what we do
They just don't make love like they used to
I remember when I loved you...
They just don't make love like they used to"
"I was standing in the yard watching you go
You only been gone about an hour or so
I'm already wondering what I'll do
All by myself without you
Then it hit me like a lightning crash
I'm gonna sit here and cry until you come back
Better tell the boss I can't come in
At least not until you love me again
Mommy's gonna get a little bit tired
But it's okay, it's alright
It don't take a whole lot of cash
To sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here alone wondering why
Counting every tear that I can cry
Broke down train on a one-way track
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Well I guess I didn't really think this through
But I'll lose my mind when it comes to you
Been out here every night and day
Waiting on the blues to go away
But I just think they're gonna turn black
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here alone wondering why
Counting every tear that I can cry
Broke down train on a one-way track
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack
Gonna sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here and cry 'til you come back
Sit here and cry 'til you come back"
"Well they call em' the cheap seats,
Yeah right fifty bucks a piece,
It's pretty steep for a guy like me.
But it's worth it baby just to see your eyes
Light up tonight (light up tonight)
We can barely even see the band,
Out here by the beer stand, oh but you don't care,
You take my hand say you wanna dance and we're
Swayin', and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right,
Me rockin' you side to side,
Just stayin' in these arms of mine,
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
They say the shows sold out,
And it's one of there biggest crowds.
But all I see is two people right now,
Just me and you and all I wanna do
Is never leave this place,
With these arms around your waist.
Take a little break for a kiss, on your lips.
Been waitin' to long for a night like this just
Swayin', and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right,
Me rockin' you side to side,
Just stayin' in these arms of mine,
Wrapped up tight just swayin'
I just wanna be close to you,
And baby all I wanna do, is keep
Swayin', and prayin'
That the band don't ever stop playin'
Our favorite songs all night long.
Oh baby don't it feel so right,
Me rockin' you side to side,
Just stayin' in these arms of mine,
Wrapped up tight just swayin',
Oh girl just prayin'
You'll stay in these arms all night."
"If to love you is forbidden
Then I'll just have to break the rules
And if our love must be hidden
Then we'll still be together
Because Those fools
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart
There's no weapon could deter me
No I won't stop at anything
One more threat it wouldn't acre me
'cause I'm only living for one thing
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart
Together we'll still be with each other
Forever just waiting for each other
Together forever
In the morning she awakens
She breaks down and cry 'cause her only
Heart had been taken
And she rather die than live apart
Won't stop us meeting heart to heart
Can't stop a beating heart to heart"
"That sad song on the radio didn't help at all
I've listened for the phone so long but you're not gonna call
I never knew an hour could seem so much like a day
I just can't stand it anymore I've got to get away
There's something lonely in this house this house that's filled with memories
There's something lonely in this house and that something lonely is me
[ steel ]
I've done all of the little things I do best when I'm blue
Closed the door and walked the floor and cried and cried for you
I didn't know I'd miss you so until you went away
This isn't home now anymore it's just a place to stay
There's something lonely...
Oh that something lonely is me"
"Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominiker hen
And a rose of a different name.
Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name.
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone.
When the devil made that woman
Lord, she threw the pattern away
She was built for speed with the tools you need
To make a new fool every day.
Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name.
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone.
The devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple headed man
Help me leave that black rose alone"
"The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free
In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll"
"Turn out the lights and close the door
Put your head on the pillow
Let me keep you warm
I want to run my hands across your face
Lyin' beside you is still the perfect place
We're still going strong
So glad that you came along
Babe in every way
You're still beautiful to me
I just have to say
You're still beautiful to me
Lay back baby and close your eyes
Let me do everything your heart desires
When I think of the years making love to you
There still ain't nothing that I'd rather do
There's something I can't deny
You sure know how to move this guy
Babe in every way
You're still beautiful to me
I just have to say
You're still beautiful to me
(And it still feels good)
It still feels good
It still runs deep
When you get close, babe
I still get weak
""Cause in these arms is where you belong
We're still going strong
So glad that you came along
Hey babe, you're still number one
Baby can't you see
You're still beautiful to me
You'll always be so beautiful to me"
"The prisons are empty
The homeless have houses
Nobody's hungry
Nobody''s poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war
We buried our swords
We don't fight anymore
[Chorus]
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Nobody's lonely, used, or neglected
Children are cherished from the day that they're born
Even a stranger's never a stranger
No bars on the windows
No locks on our doors
Cuz we open our doors
Not afraid anymore
[Chorus]
Just think of how much better off we'd be
If we open up our hearts
If we believe
You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Ohhhhh
If we loved
If we loved
If we loved a little harder"

Then we'll gather around the throne there to live forever more

"(Excuse me, Miss, but do you have any...)
Blue Christmas lights for my Christmas tree?
I want some blue Christmas lights just as blue as me
The one I love has set me free, but I still got her memory
Give me blue Christmas lights for my Christmas tree
(Pardon me, but do you have any...)
Blue Christmas lights? Blue they've gotta be
Blue Christmas lights, for that's how you left me
Although, sweetheart, you're far away, I'll kiss your picture
Christmas Day
Under blue Christmas lights on my Christmas tree
The one I love has set me free, but I still got her memory
Give me blue Christmas lights for my Christmas tree
I'll have have a blue Christmas 'cause you're not here with me"
"(The bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side)
When I awke this a morning the rain was a pouring down
I was gonna wed the little river girl just over the bridge across town
Now I'm a runnin' up and down the river and my nerves are drivin' me wild
Because the bridge washed out I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Rain oh rain stop a fallin' dark clouds hurry from the sky
The preacher and my bride is a waitin' and the weddin' bells are starting to chime
I can't kiss and hold her and it's driving me out of my mind
The bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
[ guitar ]
Now I got one foot in the water the other foot solid on the ground
When I try to swim that ragin' ol' river I know if I try I'd drown
There's not a boat around me they walked on out with the tide
And the bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side
Rain oh rain stop a fallin'...
The bridge washed out and I can't swim and my baby's on the other side"
"Somehow I'm not gettin' through to you
For you don't treat me like you used to do
I see a far away look in your eyes
And I'm afraid that we're saying goodbye
I had a bad bad dream last night
I dreamed that someone else
Was holding you tight
Another's arms were holdin' you
Another's lips were kissin' you
I had a bad bad dream last night
Oh I don't hardly know you anymore
For you don't act the same as before
Hold me close and whisper I love you
And that my bad bad dream won't come true
I had a bad bad dream last night"
"City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells) silver bells it's Christmas time in the city
(Ring a ling) ring a ling (hear them ring) hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day
Strings of street lights even stop lights blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crush see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene and above all this bustle you hear
(Silver bells) silver bells"
"Somebody blew out the speakers when the kick went
Bonfires burn down the red coast glowing in your eyes
I've been waiting all night for the crowd to thin out to talk to you
We got the buzz and the want you, baby, all we need is a little more time
I know you've been drinking what I've been drinking
I hope you've been thinking what I've been thinking
Let's throw a little after party
A candle on the tailgate
Baby I can't wait to get this thing started
A sky full of moon and a million crazy little things to do
Let's throw a little after party
Baby, just me and you
I kept a six-pack stashed here back for us just in case
Our friends are all hooked up, laid back, passed out, or long gone
Girl watching you dance in the moonlight's making my mind race
I think the breeze through the trees and the crickets are playing our song
That smile says you're knowing what I've been knowing
Let's take this thing where it oughta be going
Let's throw a little after party
A candle on the tailgate
Baby, I can't wait to get this thing started
A sky full of moon and a million crazy little things to do
Let's throw a little after party
Baby, just me and you
Well the night's still young and baby so are we
There's just one place where you need to be
Let's throw a little after party
A candle on the tailgate
Baby, I can't wait to get this thing started
A sky full of moon and a million crazy little things to do
Let's throw a little after party
Baby, just me and you
Let's throw a little after party
Oh baby, just me and you"

How much time does it take to get along
Well you worry me about it day and night
How much time does it take to get it right
I've heard that life is like a song
when you find a friend well the world just sings along
But something's wrong with you and me
'Cause you wont sing the song and I can't let it be
How much time does it take to get it right
How much time does it take to get along
Well you worry me about it day and night
How much time does it take to get it right
We've learned the words, we knew what to say
What about the feeling that got lost along the way
You tried the waltz, 2 step gets you down
And I just get the feeling like sitting out a round"
"We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out overseas
A leather-neck, jarhead marine
He said ""the radiator leaks,
And the timing-belt is worn,
But the heart and soul of this old beat up truck,
Is the dashboard.""
""it's seen alot of tan legs,
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs, and rock and roll.
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad,
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photo graphs.""
He said ""if I don't come back,
You can have this ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard.""
He said ""the paint is peeling off,
It's got dents in both the doors,
If something happens to me don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard.""
""it's seen alot of tan legs,
Got a kick ass radio
Heard alot of singing along with some country songs, and rock and roll.
Got a thirty eight bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad,
Alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photo graphs.""
He said ""if I don't come back,
You can have this ford,
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard.""
I had the engine overhauled,
A paint-job and brand new chrome
I had her washed and waxed, sittin' in the drive the day that he came home
I said ""here's the keys,
She's all yours,
I fixed everything,
But the dashboard"""
"Oh Lord, when You hide Your face from me
And I pass through the darkness of my soul
Unaware that the shadow of Your rings
Is keepin' me from standin' in the cold
[Chorus]
Somewhere out of the darkness
I need a light to shine
Fair as the moon, bright as the sun
Oh, I need You to lead me on, lead me on
And when this calloused heart turns into stone
And the shadows are falling on my mind
Turn around in Your silence, hear my voice
I'm prayin' for Your mercy one more time
[Chorus]
Lead me on, I will follow, lead me on
Oh, lead me on, I will follow, lead me on
When this veil of doubt surrounds me, I will look for You
Never turning to the left or to the right
Like a sailor with his eyes upon the stars
Traveling through the shadows of the night
[Chorus]"
"Strip Off The Ends Of Me, Where Im Calloused
Come On Look Inside
Reach In, Find A Piece Of Me, Hold On, Pull Til I Unwind
Take Me From The Tip Of My Tongue
Unravel Me Make Me Unravel
Turn Me, Upside Down
Spread Me Out Until I Come
Until I Come, Until I Come, Until I Comeundone
Can You Feel My Veins Tangled Up In You
Can You See Me All Exposed
Red And Blue Im Bleeding Into You
Untwist My Heart til I Explode
Take Me From The Tip Of My Tongue
Unravel Me Make Me Unravel
Turn Me, Upside Down
Spread Me Out Until I Come
Until I Come, Until I Come, Until I Come
Im Coming, Im Coming

"NO LETTER TODAY
WRITER FRANKIE BROWN aka TED DAFFAN
'59 Peer International, BMI
No letter today I've waited since dawn I've waited each day since you have been gone
No letter today all the days are so long oh why don't you write I know I was wrong
Just give me one chance please won't you forgive I'll love you my dear as long as I live
I know it's no use though I hope and I pray the postman goes by no letter today
Just give me one chance please won't you forgive I'll love you my dear as long as I live

"My father was a common man
His fair is such a thing
An ordinary common man
Till he begin to sing
It felt like Angels guided around
To listen to each gentle sound
My father use to sing
My father use to sing
Oh how I love the memories
And if I closed my eyes and dreamed
My father sings to me
He sang of love and everyone
Saw something of his heart
And for awhile the worries past
He sat then with empty arms
And silence fell on angry men
And harden eyes turned misty when
My father use to sing
My father use to sing
Oh how I love the memories
And if I closed my eyes and dreamed,
My father sings to me
Music ----
My father had the gift of song
And gave His gift to me
I've had such blessings from that gift
I only wish he could hear
Could see the pleasure and the joy
Gods giving to the little boy
Whose father use to sing
My Father use to Sing"
"Panis angelicus
Fit panis hominum;
Dat panis coelicus
Figuris terminum:
O res mirabilis!
Manducat Dominum
Pauper, servus et humilis.
Te trina Deitas,
Unaque poscimus,
Sic nos tu visita,
Sicut te colimus;
Per tuas semitas
Duc nos quo tendimus,
Ad lucem quam inhabitas."
"Maybe it's the glance from across the room
Or a hint of just the right perfume
Suddenly two strangers become friends
I don't know how love starts
But i sure know how it ends
A few angry words you just can't take back
Cold bitter tears as a suitcase is packed
Next thing you know you're back
To being strangers again
I don't know how love starts
But i sure know how it ends
Maybe it's the way she says your name
And no one else's touch feels quite the same
Suddenly you find you're fallin?in
I don't know how love starts
But i sure know how it ends
A few angry words you just can't take back
Cold bitter tears as a suitcase is packed
Love comes and goes
But don't ask me why or when
I don't know how love starts
But i sure know how it ends"
"Have you ever seen a prairie wind
Make a wave on a wheat field bringing needed rain
Have you ever seen a mama stop
A baby's cry with just the touch and a whisper of his name
When she looks at me
That's what I see
[Chorus]
She's beautiful like that
Like a winter rose, snow on the ground
I was blessed the day I found her
I'm one lucky man
Cause the more I know the more I need her
The more I love the more I see her heart
Is a shining star
She's beautiful like that
Have you ever seen a purple sky
Sun coming up bringing life, to everything it shines on
Have you ever seen a couple after fifty years
Laughing and holding hands still going strong
Well the reason why
I'll love her 'til the day I die
[Chorus]
The sound of a church bell
The road that leads back home
An unspoken promise
You'll never be alone
She's beautiful like that
Just like a winter rose, snow on the ground
I was blessed the day I found her
I'm one lucky man
Cause the more I know the more I need her
The more I love the more I see her heart
Is a shining star
She's beautiful like that
She's beautiful like that
She's beautiful like that"
"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
"Been together four years and had five kids
So we did the right thing and finally got hitched
We tracked down the preacher after altar call
And proceeded to the VFW Hall
When he said, Cledus T. did you take Debra Liz
I stuttered, I do, knowin' I done did
The wedding cake was, 'Moon Pie', stacked three tiers
And the punch bowl flowed with Falstaff Beer
Now that's about as swanky as this town gets
For they throw rice, heck, they threw grits
No stretch limousine, just a full sized van
But at least we was headed for the promised land
On our hillbilly honeymoon
No champagne Caviar or Cordon Bleu
A can of Vienna Sausage and a Mountain Dew
And soda pop too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Spent all our money on pay per view
Didn't need Playboy to get in the mood
Just a roller derby wrestlin' and a Rambo II
And III and IV, I was up in the room
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Well, after a while things simmered down
So we got dressed up for a night on the town
There ain't nothing too good for my sweetheart
Took a romantic stroll through the Super WalMart
We got back wanting some fine cuisine
We bought out the whole dern vending machine
On our hillbilly honeymoon
No dainty little plates of finger foods
Just M&M;'s Snickers and tomato juice
And Cheez Wiz too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
I spent half our savings on the hardware aisle
She spent the rest on the latest styles
A thong underwear that drove me wild
Back in the room, I tried them on too
On our hillbilly honeymoon
Well, it's been three years, got four more young'uns
Ain't a lot of time for much kissin' and a huggin'
For the last eight weeks I've slept on the couch
Think it's about time we renewed our vows
And took another hillbilly honeymoon
No [Incomprehensible] egg nog, just barbecue
And a box of wine will be nice down too
Won't need a corkscrew, yeah
On our hillbilly honeymoon
We can raid little Tommy's piggy bank
Scrape up a hundred dollars worth in change
Just enough for a night at the bowling lanes
And some new perfume, cheap motel room
On our hillbilly honeymoon
[Incomprehensible]"
"Ready, Willing And Able
( written by Jess Leary / Jody Alan Sweet )
Blue moon is rising, all hope seems gone
A heart can be lonely only so long
Baby don't worry 'cause somebody cares
Just call out my name and I'll be right there
(Chorus)
If you need a shoulder strong enough to lean on
If you need a hand that fits like a glove
If you need a heart then hold on steady
'Cause I'm ready, willing and able to love
I know you're wary, you've been hurt before
But it's time to move on, girl, and close that old door
Open your heart, wipe those tears from your eyes
You've got my number, don't even think twice
(Repeat chorus)
Now you think it's over, my offer still stands
And if you're still uncertain, I'll say it again
(Repeat chorus)
Yes, I'm ready, willing and able to love"
"Turtle Dove Done Drooped His Wings-Duhks
Turtle dove done drooped his wings
Turtle dove done drooped his wings
Turtle dove done drooped his wings
Went on to Zion and he did sing
Adam and Eve, oh, no
Adam and Eve, don't ya tell it to me
Just meet me at the door, don't tell it to me

I'm going to heaven the wheel of time
When I get to heaven I know the rules
Keep going down to the bathing pool

"For just one chance to find
Love was someone that you loved to find
For just the sense to try
To walk ahead and leave the pain behind
If the days aren't easy and the nights are rough
When they ask you what you're thinking of
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Your heart says not again
What kind of mess have you got me in
But when the feelings there
It can lift you up and take you anywhere
But the gravel beneath you and the limbs above
If anybody asks you where your coming from
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say yes we live uncertainty
And disappointments have to be
And everyday we might be facing more
And yes we live in desperate times
But fading words and shaking rhymes
There's only one thing here worth hoping for
With Lucifer beneath you and God above
If either one of them asks you what your living of
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love
Say love, say for me love"
"Packed my things in a suitcase
And I've put then in the car
It's no longer my place
I've convinced my heart
You know how much I love you
This I can't deny
It hurts to look around this room
At what I leave behind
A picture sets of me and you
When things were going right
Memories of things we've been through
Slowly move across my mind
The times we've shared together
The moments we've cried
Destiny is calling to another place
Still a sea of tears
Keep falling down my face
It's the hardest thing I'll ever do
To have to go one without you
But I'll try to force a smile
And say the words goodbye
To what I leave behind
Packed my things in a suitcase
And I've put then in the car"
"I see these creatures in tired action
I hold the blade with the midnight arm
My brother dreams in real violence
My brother, dreaming through the red
In ritual positions, I kneel before his love
Far away from the world
I follow all these signs and wonders
I walk on by the suicide doors
Under the stars in animism
I'll hold the mirror for the ghost
In ritual positions, I kneel before his love
Sometimes in benediction, a mouth to sing the flood
Far away from the world"
"The Gods were angry with me for loving you
The Gods were angry with me because they knew
I stood at heaven's portal and that was too high for any model such as I
So they took down the sun the skies were gray
Then the howling winds took you away
And there was nothing I could do
Because I knew the Gods were angry with me for loving you
Once upon a time when our love was new
And I was happy with the love that I've found
Then the Gods and the sun and the moon and the stars looked down
And saw me there with you
And they sent my dream world crash into the ground
(It was because the Gods were angry with me)
The Gods were angry with me"
"When you told me that we were through
I thought it would be easy getting over you
But I know it's gonna take some time
'Cause when I come home now, what do I see
So many memories staring at me
I know you left, but you left so much behind
[Chorus:]
You got a long way to go before your gone
You left me. but your memory just won't leave me alone
It's plain to see your hold on to me just keeps on going strong
You got a long way to go before your gone
I can't take this anymore
I'm half of what I was before
Ever since I lost my better half
When I close me eyes you're all I see
You're even walking in my sleep
I want to cry but then I gotta laugh
'Cause you got a long way to go before you're gone
You left me, but your memory won't leave me alone
It still ain't clear that you ain't here to hear me babble on
You've got a long way to go before you're gone
That's right, you've got a long way baby
You've got a long way to go-you ain't gone
If you'd come back we can start anew
'Cause I'm miserable without you
It's kinda like you never left at all
You got a long way to go before your gone
You left me, but your memory just won't leave me alone
It's plain to see your hold on me just keeps n going strong
[Chorus]"
"Wish I was really going
Wish I was a blacktop road
Wish I was a steamwheel
Wish I was a radio
Wish I was in your pocket
Wish I was on your mind
Wish I was a boot you're wearing
Wish I was your valentine
But I guess I ain't your Cinderella
And if you don't want me then I don't want you back
Can't stop the rain better hold an umbrella
I don't know much but I knew that
Wish I was your whiskey baby
Wish I was on your breath
Wish you would hold me like you hold your cigarette
Wish I had a song for you to make you love me
Wish I could sing for you
Wish I could make us right
But I guess I ain't your Cinderella
And if you don't want me then I don't want you back
Can't stop the rain better hold an umbrella
I don't know much but I knew that"
"This is the story about Ed & Bettys'
A short time ago it became 'Bed & Eddies'
Cause now it's the place where I hang my hat
Truth be told, it's much more than that
When I needed help, they took me in
With a pick up truck and the hand of a friend
And now it's the place that I call my home
Where I'm always allowed, and I'm never alone
And at the dawning of the day
We've all got something more to say
Talking bout the good times
Old days, goodbyes
Ways that were all the same
Betty is the twin of my long lost dad
Closest thing to his family I ever had
And Ed's got a grin Grand Canyon wide
Always good for a joke, good for a ride
They cook their dinner
We eat fast food
They sleep in pajamas
We sleep in the nude
And they found their love in the Korean War
We found each other back in '94
But at the dawning of the day
There's always something more to say
Talking bout the good times
Old days, goodbyes
Ways that were all the same
Well small town living's alright with me
But I've got to search for what I'll believe
And there are so many places yet to go
And the more I see, the less I assume
No average man, no fortunate few
Only me and you and what well show
What do you know?
Now I'm blessed with friends all over the place
With a welcoming couch and a dinner plate
I sing them songs about walking the world
Let the melody out, the meaning unfurl
And just when I think theres nothinmore to see
All the inspirations done run out on me
I'll turn a corner, and there it begins
Its a top rate show, if you take it all in
And at the closing of the day
Theres always something more to say, hey, hey
Talking bout the good times
Old days, goodbyes
Ways that were all the same"
"I was thinking ?bout the perfect words
To say to that living doll
By the time that I had worked it out
She was half way down the hall
My schoolboy fears of being shot down
Kept that dream from getting off the ground
Lookin back I figured out I thought about it too long
Sometimes you just gotta jump in, get yourself movin?
Countdown the clock is runnin
Sometimes there?s no time to doubt it, just gotta do it
Don?t even think about it
So, baby if it seems I?m coming on too strong
It?s just that I don?t want to feel this feeling gone
'cause in this moment there could be a golden opportunity
To tell you what you mean to me
Don?t want to think about it too long
Chorus
Solo
Chorus
Don?t even think about it"
"The wind through the night is blowing so lonesome
Singing to me a song
A whippoorwill call is just a reminder
Pretty girls have hearts made of stone
I'll wake with the blues at dawn
My darling, Cora is gone
I don't know why she told me goodbye
But my darling, Cora is gone
The ring that she wears I bought for her finger
Purchased her raiment so fine
Gave her my last green back dollar
And now she's left me behind
I'll wake with the blues at dawn
My darling, Cora is gone
I don't know why she told me goodbye
But my darling, Cora is gone
Drifting along like a brush on a river
Caring not where I roam
Going to live in a deep forest
Dark hollow will be my new home
I'll wake with the blues at dawn
My darling, Cora is gone
I don't know why she told me goodbye
But my darling, Cora is gone"
"""You know I'm really gonna miss you, sugar britches""
""I'm gonna miss you too, Bub""
""Now I'm only gonna be gone a few days
But now there is a few things I need you to do while I'm gone""
""Oh, I figured there's somethin'!""
""Oh, quit complainin'""
""All you gotta do is cut the grass, wash the car, trim the hedges
Paint the fence, clean the pool, give the dog a bath
Defrost the fridge, clean out the garage""
""Right""
""Sweep the chimney, and I'll see you on Monday
I love you boogie, boogie""
""I love you too an' you, you don't you worry 'bout me, I'll be just fine""
I've got my socks dryin' in the microwave
Hair on my back I don't plan to shave
I've got the house to myself while the wife's away
I'll be rockin' all night
Yeah, I think I'll drink me an ice cold brew
Lounge in my boxers like I used to do
There'll be no Ally McBeal on the tube, no
I'll be watchin' the fight
Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Played cards with my buddies until sunrise
You know, I never thought that my neighbor would
Be sunbathing topless, Lord, she sure looks good
I caught a 10 pound bass out on the lake
Played 18 holes with my best friend, Jake
Best balls I hit was when I stepped on a rake
Oh, well it wasn't too bright
Now I look in the fridge, what do I see?
Last night's pizza starin' back at me
Pepperoni and anchovies
What a beautiful sight
Well, it's a great day to be a guy
Buck naked in my lawn chair swattin' at flies
Got some hot dogs on the charcoal grill
I don't wanna burn my wieners but I probably will
That fried baloney and cheese macaroni
Tasted good this afternoon
But now I'm passin' some serious gas and
I might have to leave the room
Pee hee!
Well, I might go get me a new hairdo
Spend a couple hours in a tanning booth
Might even get me a gold front tooth
Whoa, hah, yeah!
And it's a great day to be a guy
But when my wife gets home, she's gonna tan my hide
I'll be hung over but a lookin' good
From a week of reliving my bachelorhood
It's a great day to be a guy
But another week of this and I'd probably die
I tend to party harder than I should
When my wife's not here to make me be good
Yeah hoo!"
"Red hung out at the point of tears
He was a honky tonkin' fool
Ever since they brought that jukebox here
Back in 1952
He was the first to drop a nickel in
When he danced with his first wife
By '61 his wife was gone
But that jukebox had survived
It was three plays for a quarter
I turned on enough to go
Red showed me that ol' Wurlitzer
And said, ""Son, I want you to know
If you ever come up to be short
Just kick it on the side""
Would you do this honky tonkin' fool
One favor when I die
Roll away my tombstone
Put this jukebox in its place
Make damned sure 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Is the only song it plays
I don't need no stone with fancy words
This jukebox [unverified] cool
As a perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool
When we heard the news, me and Mr. Hughes
Put that jukebox in my truck
And hauled it on down to the place
That ol' Red had hung it up
And, I ran a short extension cord
From the old caretaker's shed
I kicked the side, played 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Looked down at Red and said
Red I rolled away your tombstone
Put this jukebox in its place
And I made damned sure 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
Is the only song it plays
You were right about that tombstone, Red
This jukebox [unverified] cool
As a perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool
It's the perfect final tribute to a honky tonkin' fool"
"I'm a long long way from where I want to be in the Arizona Prison they've got me
And until they set me free oh oh me it's a long long way from here to Tennessee
Oh my mouth is dry with dust my throat is raw
How I miss those big green trees in Arkansas
On the way to where I'll be when they set me free
But it's a long long way from here to Tennessee
A long long way from me to the girl that I love so
Will she wait for me oh Lord I don't know
I know that I've done wrong but friends I've paid the price
Back in Tennessee I left sweet paradise
But until they set me free oh oh me it's a long long way from here to Tennessee
It's a long long way from here to Tennessee
It's a long long way from here to Tennessee"
"I was so careless, I left you all alone
When I was running in the streets and carrying on
You were so patient, you never said a word
You tried to hide all your tears and bury the hurt
I was such a fool, I didn't figure it out
Till I came home last night to an empty house
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
When someone you need so desperately is gone
I didn't know how bad the hurt could be
It took you walking out to make me see
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
It's only midnight but baby with you gone
It's forever since sundown and forever till dawn
And as I lie here looking at myself
It's hitting me hard how you must have felt
I'm sorry, I hurt you and I'm sorry, you cried
And I'd give anything if I could hold you tonight
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
When someone you need so desperately is gone
I didn't know how bad the hurt could be
It took you walking out to make me see
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know it was this lonely alone
I didn't know the nights could be so long
Baby, please come home
I didn't know it was this lonely alone"
"Oh love you know I'm so afraid to fall
'Cause remember the last time
You backed me against the wall
Oh like a fool I trusted you
I was a little too naive
But this time love
You're asking way too much of me
This time love
It would be too much to take
'Cause once I fall for her
There'll be no way to escape
She'll be the one to take my heart
And never set it free
This time love
You're asking way too much of me
Oh love I don't know how long I can wait
And any minute now just might be too late
So stop me now if it can't work out
'Cause I already see
Oh this time love
You're asking way too much of me
Oh this time love
It would be too much to take
'Cause once I fall for her
There'll be no way to escape
She'll be the one to take my heart
And never set it free
Oh this time love
You're asking way too much of me"
"We've agreed not to mention any memories
Or share a single passing thought
That's just better for all concerned, is what we've found
When you're living on the sad
There's always hope, but we don't ever let it show
'Cause hopes start out real small, but how they just grow
And, just like dreams, are better left alone
Is what we've found
When you're living on the sad side of town
Please never bring up how she used to laugh at night
Would smell so sweet and giggle when I squeezed her tight
If you can put a stop to that, there's a chance you might
Fit in here well enough to try this style of life
That's just better for all concerned, is what we've found
When you're living on the sad side of town"
"I just came down from Chippewa
Had as station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by when your memory came flooding in and you closed that door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Well every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lines
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Well every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track crashing in your door.
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it didnt have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal just to get me started
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train baby
Wish it was a freight train."
"People starin' at me as they wheel me down the ramp toward my plane
The war is over for me I've forgotten everything except the pain
Thank you sir and yes sir it was worth it for the old red-white-and-blue
And since I won't be walking I suppose I'll save some money buying shoes
The bottle hidden underneath the blanket over my two battered legs
I can see see the stewardess make over me and ask were you afraid
I say why no I'm Superman and couldn't find a phone booth quite in time
A G-I gets a lotta laughs if he remembers all the funny lines
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night
Mama will be crying daddy's gonna say son did they treat you good
My uncle will be drunk and he'll say boy they do some real great things with wood
The letter that she wrote me said goodbye she couldn't wait and lots of luck
The bottle underneath the blanket feels just like an old friend to my touch
I know she'll come and see me but I bet she never once looks at my legs
She'll talk about the weather and the dress she wore the July 4th Parade
Lord I love her and I don't believe this bottle's gonna get her off my mind
I see here in the paper where they say the war is just a waste of time
Mama bake a pie daddy kill a chicken your son is comin' home 11:35 Wednesday night"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"
"For years we both have lived on pride, dear
And we agree that love is gone
Why, oh why do we keep tryin'
A house without love is not a home.
The love light in your eyes has faded
And I'm contented just to roam
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
A house without love is not a home.
No matter where our footsteps wander
I know we'll both be all alone
With the pride that came between us
A house without love is not a home.
The simple things have gone forever
We wanted wealth to call our own
And now we've reached the hour of parting
A house without love is not a home."
"Way Back home where the cypress grew
In a clapboard shack on the black bayou
Live a woman and a man that I call Mom and Dad
And Times were hard and times were tough
We barely had nothing' but we didn't need much
Except for the love of a woman and a man
Daddy worked his fingers to the bone
But I know my momma was the reason he was strong
[Chorus]
Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds don't sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when you're living in a house that you don't own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man
Well, I grew up working like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand
You see, the only thing that matters money can't buy
And when it gets down the bottom line
It's the love you find between a woman and a man
Everything Daddy said to me was true
Cause my life was not complete until I found you
[Chorus: x2]
Only thing in life that stands
Is the love between a woman and a man"
"When God dips his pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine when God dips his love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well it makes me laugh it makes me cry sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips his love in my heart
Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find him there to whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
He walked every step up calvary's ragged way
To give his life completely and bring a better day
My life was steeped and sinned but in love he took me in
His blood washed away every stain
Well I said I wouldn't tell it...
When God dips his love in my heart"
"We made camp along the river
Watch the cattle
As they bend down
Back at the wagons
Right after supper
Spread the bed rolls
On the ground
Me an willie
We took the night guard
And the sage
Never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon
Was blazin silver
No chance tonight
For stampede
We rode off yonder
In the distance
Towards the mountains
There in the west
Then I see lightening
And I hear thunder
My mind is weary I could use some rest
Then all at once
The wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in
Behind the tumble weeds
These longhorn cattle
Are gettin restless
God help us all
If they stampede
Smell the rain
And hear the thunder
The midnight sky
Turns balck as death
Lightening crashes
Smell the sulfur
It's rank and strong
As satan's breath
The cattle rise up
And go around
I steer my pony
On to take a lead
And across the heard
I can hear willie yellin
Hey stampede
Dust clouds ride
As the rain falls
They mix together
Turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns
Brush against me
And I can feel the demons
Racin through my blood
And all at once
My pony stumbles
We hit the ground
And I rise
Up to my knees
And flash a light
I can see the cattle comin
Lord I know
I'm gonna die
In this stampede
Then I wait
And I look around
I'm in my bed roll
And I;m layin on the ground
Over there's a wagon
And there's the campfire
I was only dreamin
But what's that sound
Then I feel the earth
Tremble beneath me
As the midnight sky
Begins to bleed
And from the blackness
I can hear willie yellin
Hey stampede"
"This old bar stools feeling higher
As a started sinking lower
The minute that she waltzed right through that door
Not long ago I held her
Like a fool I went and left her
Now she's with somebody else out on that floor
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
Well that music's gettin' louder
As my heart keeps beatin' faster
As she spells out regret in perfect time
Well I thought I wanted freedom
But that ball and chain I needed
'Cause when you choose, sometimes you lose the prize
And she's got the rhythm and I got the blues
And she's showing me how much I had to lose
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues
With her every little move she's telling me I'm over you
She's got the rhythm and I got the blues"
"We don't need a Friday
We don't need a crowded bar downtown
To get a little sideways
Yeah, we got our own way to get unwound
Every now and then
Everybody knows
You gotta live a little
Let your crazy show
When the world gets to spinnin' too fast
And you wanna make it stop
We got the spot
This is our night
This is our time
Gettin' out of sight
And out of our minds
Cold beer bringin' out the wild side
Out here livin' up the wildlife
We toast the sky with every one we know
Here's to us and just lettin' it go
Howlin' at the moon hangin' up high
Feelin' just right
Out here livin' up the wildlife
Yeah, out here livin' up the wildlife
A little static on the radio
With some seven eleven
Nights down in the cooler
That's all she wrote
We gettin' down in the dust
No, they can't tame us
This is our night

"Well you mama finds it hard to understand,
Why her lovin' son wants to be a rodeo man.
And your daddy had a whole lotta great big plans for you,
You hate to disappoint him but you gotta other things to do.
Now, your best girl thinks it's time you settle down.
You finally graduated and she's ready for a wedding gown.
But there's a great big world just waintin' out there for you,
And if she really loves you she can wait another year or two.
And nobody really knows how you feel inside,
The road gets rough and the goin' gets tough, but you know you've gotta
Try.
And there ain't no way they're ever gonna change your mind.
Don't everybody know that a cowboys got to ride.
Now your highschool buddies say man, you've gone insane.
Don't you know rodeo is a crazy, foolish game.
But you can see in their eyes a little jealousy,
They're all workin' 9-5, you're footloose and fancy free.
And nobody really knows how you feel inside,
The road gets rough and the goin' gets tough, but you know you've gotta
Try.
And there ain't now way thery're ever gonna change your mind.
Don't everybody know that a cowboys got to ride.
Don't everybody know taht a cowboys got to ride..."
"She says, 'it's cold where you brought me'
He says, 'Darling, don't worry
You can stay in my arms
Until the springtime comes
We'll let the snow drift around us
And wait for the robin and the crocus
To tell us that our love has again found the sun'
Lone oak stands tall,
Bare arms scratch the sky,
Dry leaves cracking beneath our feet
Hand in hand we've watched
The autumn fires burn -
Summer's dreams collapsing,
Chestnuts in need of gathering,
The whole world lies rotting in the street
Soon we will walk with collars high
Like ramparts raised for the siege
We'll bow to her beauty,
Cower from her fury
Sent as a judgment for a slight
Long past forgotten
Winter's love once again unrequited
Winter's love once again unrequited
She says, 'Babe are you sleeping?'
He says, 'No, wide awake and thinking
Of a dream I just had about the two of us
He takes his hand to her cheek now,
His lips to her brow,
Their whispers pile softly
By the foot of the bed"
"I fly away to heaven and I won't fall
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
No more sorrow and no more pain
When the angels carry me home
I ride that heavenly glorious train
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home
I walk Thy highway leading to heaven
When the angels carry me home
I see Jesus waiting for me in heaven
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
When the angels carry me home
I want to see Jesus first of all
When the angels carry me home"
"In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Once I knew a young man went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word but just his high beam lights
Who'd have ever thought they'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long as it would till the end
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Another young man safely, strummed his silver stringed guitar
And He played to people everywhere some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy, his simple songs confess
And the music he had in him so very few possess
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
The there was an old man kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book never missed a page
And loved him like a father, and I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time could shortly come but I did not know just when
In my hour of darkness in my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord, grant me vision oh, Lord grant me speed"
"To the father and the son
Who never talk,
Come back home
To the husband and the wife
Who are both at fault,
Come back home
Forget the past and start again
Face to face and make amends
Calling out around the world
Every heartbroken boy,
Every lonely girl
Take what's right
And forgive what's wrong
I'm calling all hearts
To come back home
From the single mom
Trying to make ends meet
Daddy come back home
From the parents of the child
Living out on the street
Baby come back home
Forget the past and start again
Face to face and make amends
Can I hear an Amen?
Can I hear an Amen?
To every soul
Who's lost their way,
Come back home
Yeah the wait is over,
Today's the day
Come back home
Come back home
Oh calling out around the world
Every heartbroken boy,
Every lonely girl
Take what's right
And forgive what's wrong
I'm calling all hearts,
I'm calling out around the world
Every heartbroken boy,
Every lonely girl
Take what's right
And forgive what's wrong
I'm calling all hearts to come back home"
"Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one, when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear
Baby of mine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head, down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be
Baby of mine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head, down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be
Baby of mine
Baby of mine"
"I am the truth
I am Honesty
I am listening
When you speak to me
I can ease your pain
Make you stand out in the rain
And wander aimlessly
I am strong, undeniable
I am not afraid, unconditional
I can build you up
I can bring you to your knees
I'm unpredictable
[Chorus]
I am the way
I can set you free
Tear down the walls
Baby can't you see?
Open your heart
Surrender all your fears
And put your faith in me
I'm all you need
I am love
I am young
I am old
I'm the breath of life
In every soul
I am happiness
I can warm you
When you're naked
Standing in the cold
[Chorus: x2]
I am the truth
I am honesty
I am listening When you speak to me"
"Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your big sister?s dress
I could hear my own heart beating, when you laid your head on my chest.
No telling how long it was since the last song
With the band gone and the lights all faded.
All alone on that gym floor, dancing with no music playing.
Me in my rented tuxedo, you in your mama?s white dress
Rice in your hair, your shoes in one hand, and one hand caressing my neck.
The light from the moon filled that old hotel room
As my hands closed around your waist.
And we were holding each other, dancing with no music playing
Ohhhh, there's nothing to say
Youuu take me away
Dancing with no music playing
Oh, dancing with no music playing
Me in my old faded Levi?s, you in your blue cotton dress
Time it don't have no effect on the way that you still steal my breath.
As we spin once more across the cold kitchen floor,
Your warm cheek touches my face,
And I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing
Oh, I could die in your arms, dancing with no music playing"
"Every morning when I wake up
I pour coffee in my cup
And I look out on the fields
Of the land that I call home
And if there's no chance of rain
And I need to get away
I'll grab a saddle
And be long, long gone
Looks like a good day to ride
Underneath this big warm sun
Looks like a good day
To let this old boy fly
Loose on the reins and on the run
To a blue and endless sky
Looks like a good day to ride
There's a world that's in a race
For some money and some fame
But out here there's nothin'
All I need is what I have
So when I wanna free my mind
From the concrete in the sides
I head for the mountains
Back to who I am
(Chorus)
Wow
(Chorus)
Looks like a good day to ride, yeah"
"It seems you've gone, without leaving
All the doors, are closed at night
Though I've tried ,to think of leaving
Goodbye isn't really good at all
If there were really something good to it
And I knew it wouldn't get me down
I could leave in the morning
But goodbye isn't really good at all
Here we are, alone together
That's the truth, and that's the lie
Though I try, I can't get over
Goodbye isn't really good at all
If goodbye were like it sometimes seems
If it could be like it's been in some of my dreams
I could leave in the morning
But goodbye isn't really good at all"
"Listen all you rounders take a tip from me
Listen all you rounders take a tip from me
Dont you ever marry if you love your liberty
Dont do it boy
oh-laydi-yay-oh-laydi-yay-oh-ladi-yii
A woman will tell you, you can do just as you please
A woman will tell you, you can do just as you please
But when she gets you shell find an ace up her sleeve
oh-laydi-yay-oh-laydi-yay-oh-ladi-yii
Once I had lots of money and I rattled it all the time
I had lots of money and I rattled it all the time
But now all I hear rattlin is this ball and chain of mine
oh-laydi-yay-oh-laydi-yay-oh-ladi-yii
When I was a singer I had girls by the score
When I was a singer I had girls by the score
But now Im married and they dont love me no more"
"The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yeah life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you
And I kind of miss your broken smile
Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
I remember you and me
Lost and young and dumb and free
And unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone
So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me
Turn to light or fade to black
You don't look back, no you don't look back
And what you meant now born a sea
So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
The sun goes down and five years gone
Life goes on, yes life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me
Save part of yourself for me"
"Barely 18 thought I knew it all
My little hometown was way too small
For the big dreams I'd been dreaming
I thought the fast lane and bright lights was what I was needing
A few long years have come and gone
I finally saved enough to get back home
To the hills, the creeks, and timbers
Where's that slow paced laid back place I remember?
[Chorus]
Tell me where has my hometown gone?
Lord this looks nothing like the place that I come from
What happened to the down home road that I was raised up on
Tell me where has my hometown gone?
There's a mini mall where I used to hunt squirrels
Time's made momma's out of the girls
I used to chase when I was younger
They say old Mayor Baker is six feet under
River view Drive is up to four lanes
No whistle blows from that midnight train that used to haul out of South field Mines
Yeah that quiet little place is just a memory of mine
[Chorus]
I miss my fishin' hole, barber pole, front porch swing, drive in, skating rink, Dairy Queen
[Chorus]"
"You're telling me
We gotta talk
That you can't go on
Holdin' it inside
No it isn't
Anybody's fault
I shouldn't blame myself
You know I tried
You thought it through
How you agonized
Though it took some time
Now you know for sure
What we have really isn't what
You're looking for
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more
No it really doesn't
Ease the pain
When you say you wish
It had all worked out
And being sorry
Isn't gonna change
What I'm losing here
What I'm feeling now
There'll be nights
When I toss and turn
With your hollow words
Ringing in my ears
I think I heard enough to hurt about
You made it clear
Say no more
Baby I get the picture
Say no more
'Cause I'll never understand
How you fell out of love
But you spelled it out enough
I'll be ok
And you'll be ok
Please walk away
And say no more"
"Beneath the neon haze here in this honky tonk
I tell everyone who'll listen I don't miss her being gone
I've got a big smile painted on my face, that's all they see
Guess there ain't no limits to what some people will believe
I can say I've burned her memory
But I'm just blowin' smoke
There's embers in the ashes
They haven't yet grown cold
In the darkness here I hide a tear
Hoping it won't show
I can say I've burned her memory, but I know
I'm just blowin' smoke
I don't want to face the truth that I'm still in love with her
So I tell 'em she's just history as far as I'm concerned
I got over her the minute that she walked out the door
I just look 'em in the eye and lie
Ain't that what honky tonks are for
I can say I've burned her memory
But I'm just blowin' smoke
There's embers in the ashes
They haven't yet grown cold
In the darkness here I hide a tear
Hoping it won't show
I can say I've burned her memory, but I know
I'm just blowin' smoke"
"Easy lovin' so sexy lookin'
I know from the feelin' that it comes from the heart
Easy lovin' everyday's things givin'
To count all my blessin's I wouldn't know where to start
Every time I look you over so real to life it seems
Upon your pretty shoulders there's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin' seein's believin'
Life with you's like livin' in a beautiful dream
Every time I look you over
In a beautiful dream"
"Well capitalistic yeast has been sucking the heat
You're passing up, you're injured for ability
Well, I've been waiting for a compromise but I guess it's more the same
We're separated all the things that we want for gain
You remember your name
Well they were looking right at you, you forget the face
If the future's sipping all space and food through a straw
And the monster's finally flipped on it's back
Well, the static is a worthy test to help you brush aside the rest
Is this something that you'd ever need?
Well, I'm okay
Are you scared to take what they've taken from you?
Well yeah, I'm afraid
We've sold our names...
I'm sick of being accosted by the ghost in the street
Your magazine looking backward thinking junkies are just fodder for the global elite
Do you think you had a choice
When you're eating and sleeping in all the noise?
Let the moneymakers keep the politicians afloat
We're biting everything that we're told
Well, then a smile and a couple of jokes will be enough to convince the good folks
Well, is this something you ever need?
Well, I'm okay
Are you waiting for a minute to fight for what they've taken from you?
Yeah, I'm afraid
We've sold our names..."
"What will I do with all those yesterdays where will I go what will I say
How can I live since you have gone away what will I do with all those yesterdays
Tomorrow never bothers me I know what it will bring
It is just another day and it won't mean a thing
But when nighttime falls and mem'ries come to play
What will I do with all those yesterdays
[ guitar ]
Tomorrow never bothers me..."
"Well I've been lockin' myself up in my house for sometime now
Readin' and writin' and readin' and thinkin'
And searching for reasons and missing the seasons.
The Autumn, the Spring, the Summer, the snow.
The record will stop and the record will go.
Latches latched the windows down,
The dog coming in and the dog going out.
Up with caffeine and down with a shot.
Constantly worried about what I've got.
Distracting my work but I can't make a stop
And my confidence on and my confidence off.
And I sink to the bottom and rise to the top
And I think to myself that I do this a lot.
World outside just goes
It goes it goes it goes it goes it goes
And witness it all from the blinds of my window.
Three, four
I'm a little nervous 'bout what you'll think
When you see me in my swimming trunks
And last night in New York I got raging drunk
Remember one time I got raging drunk with you
Now, I can recall a time when we made the city
Streets our playground, kissing in the fountains
Filled with cigarettes and bottles
Sped through Italian city streets of cobblestone
Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because the damned alcohol
Because what ever at all
Now I've grown to aware of my mortality
To let go and forget about dying
Long enough to drop the hammer down
And let the indolence go wild and flying through
Because we had to
Because I loved you
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to
Because we had to"
"He searched for those wings that he knew
That this angel should have at her back
And although he can't find them
He really don't mind
Because he knows they'll grow back
And he reached for that halo that he knows
That she had when she first caught his eye
Although his hand came back empty
He's really not worried
'cause he knows it still shines
I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
Or keep this tarnished halo shined
But I'll never betray your trust
Angel mine
I search all the time on the ground
For our shadows cast side by side
Just to remind me that I haven't gone crazy
That you exist and are mine
And I know that your skin is as warm and as real
As that smile in your eyes
But I have to keep touching and smelling
And tasting for fear it's all lies
I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
Or keep this tarnished halo shined
But I'll never betray your trust
Angel mine
Last night I awoke from the deepest of sleeps
With your voice in my head
And I could tell by your breathing
That you were still sleeping
I repeated those words that you had said
I can't promise that I'll grow those wings
Or keep this tarnished halo shined
But I'll never betray your trust
Angel mine"
"Let's dance! Uh
(Yes ma'am
Is Charlotte Johnson at home by chance?
Uh yea ma'am we're supposed to have a date tonight.
Where we going?
I'll tell you where we're going
Swinging)
There's a little girl, living in my neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson mmm mmm lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
Walked over to her house, and this was goin' on
Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her momma was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the back yard rollin' up a garden hose
And I was on the porch with Charlotte feelin' love down to my toes
And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yeah we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin' (swingin) Just swingin' (swingin')
Now Charlotte she's a darlin she's the apple of my eye
When I'm on the swing with her it makes me oh so high
Now Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I can't believe it started on her front porch in the swing
And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yeah we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin' (swingin) Just swingin' (swingin')
And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yeah we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin' (swingin) Just swingin' (swingin')
Here we go
Me and Charlotte sittin' on the porch swing
Eating moon pies sipping on the Real Thing
Daddy comes out with a 12 gauge shotgun
Had a flashback from his days in Viet Nam
Honey please you're my daughter
I guess she forgot all the things I taught her
Shot gun blast my ears ringing on the front porch
UH
And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yeah we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin' (swingin') Just swingin' (swingin')
That's what we were doing
Swinging
There's your money in the bank...two step to that
There's a little girl, living in my neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson mmm mmm lookin' good
Now Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the spring
I can't believe it started on her front porch in a swing
Here we go
Me and Charlotte sittin' on the porch swing
Eating moon pies sipping on the Real Thing
Daddy comes out with a 12 gauge shotgun
Had a flashback from his days in Viet Nam
Honey please you're my daughter
I guess she forgot all the things I taught her
Shot gun blast my ears ringing on the front porch
UH
And we were swingin' (swinging)
Yeah we were swingin' (swinging)
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing
I can't believe it started on the front porch in a swing
Just swingin' (swingin') Just swingin' (swingin')
That's what we were doing
Swinging
There's your money in the bank, two step to that
Don't touch that knob there might be some jam on it
Too much jam on it Too much jam on it
Too much jam on it"
"Smiles in the morning as warm as sunshine
Kisses when I lay down at night
And two loving arms to console me
I should be scared it's so right
But too much of a good thing is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on
You look in my eyes and see my thinking
I know when you're happy, and when you're sad
Some would say it's too perfect
But I don't think what we have is so bad
Cause too much of a good thing is a good thing
Feelings like this can't be wrong
And too much of a good thing is a good thing
And we've got a good thing going on"
"I LOVE YOU DEAR
(Jack Moran)
'71 Alpine Music
Please put down the paper turn off the TV
And darling look over my way
And I know that lately we ain't done much talking
But there's something I just have to say
I love you dear I love you dear
I haven't said that is such a long long time
Come sit close beside me and give me a chance
To prove I'm so glad you're still mine
My golf clubs your bridge clubs have kept us both busy
And Johnny and Jean are half grown
Time makes it easy to take things for granted
Like knowing that you are my own
But I love you dear..."
"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Sleep in heavenly peace"
"My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world that could ever change my love
Something happened to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
And every day it seems I want you more
My love is warmer
Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me
Once I thought you'd never come my way
Now it only goes to show how wrong we all can be
For now I have to tell you every day
My love is warmer"
"I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The son of God discloses
[Chorus]
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
[Chorus]"
"It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from it all
My love has been untrue, she's found her, somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like crying, dying, what can I do?
I feel like praying, saying, I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
How can I make believe, that I don't sit and grieve?
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I can't pretend and say, that I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I feel like crying, dying, what can I do?
I feel like praying, saying, I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues
I feel like running away from the blues"
"I was a new kid on the circuit
Gold buckles in my eyes
But the horse I drew was plenty rank
Much to my surprise
I did a double back flip
And landed on my head
This old cowboy limped out in the arena
Leaned over me and said
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
Get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
By the end of my last season
They said I was among the best
So I proudly called a girl back home
Hopin' she would be impressed
But her momma said she married a guy
That I used to call my friend
But before the first tear could fall
These words came back again
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
You get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
Well its not an easy lesson
To learn in life and love
But its the only way to go
Whenever you bite the dust
You gotta cowboy up
When you get throwed down
Get right back in the saddle
As soon as you hit the ground
You heard that the tough get goin'
When the goin' gets tough
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up
Around here what we say is
Boy you better cowboy up"
"There's folks building homes as sweet as can be
They're levelling their yards and planting their trees
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
But my little hut I'll just let it be
Lord Jesus is building a mansion for me
Each day I am getting more ready to go
He's cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I'm packing my troubles I'm bound with his love
Get ready to move to Heaven above
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you go
There's coming a time when we'll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day"
"Well you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be
The choosen one
She said, you're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes
And when you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you
About right and wrong
Hey but you're, but you're looking good, baby
I believe that you're feeling fine, shame about it
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes
'Cause you woke up this morning
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes
When you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same
Since the blues walked into town
But you're, but you're one in a million
'Cause you got that shotgun shine, boom
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes, yeah
Woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes
Yeah, you woke up this morning
You got a blue moon in your eyes
When you woke up this morning everything was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like some bell from your head down to your toes
Like some voice trying to tell you there's something you should know
Last night you was flying but today you're so low
Times like these makes you wonder if you'll ever know
Meaning of things as they appear to the others
Wives, husbands, fathers, sisters and brothers
Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink'
Well you do make up your mind to go on, 'cos
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone
Everything you had was long gone
You see I woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
You wanna be, you wanna be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know it because you, you just can't help yourself
Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah
Woke up this morning, yeah, yeah
Woke up this morning and you did it girl
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun"
"Won't you take me home to mama she loves me and she'll keep me safe and warm
All I ask is take me home to mama please take me home to mama's arms
Oh greyhound bus I bet she could never guess
Where I got the money to buy this ticket home
Well I tell you after years of tears and hard work today I made it
I reached bottom I've begged on the street that's how I got it
Won't you take me home to mama...
I've lost many things in my life but today I lost my pride
So ol' greyhound take me home to mama I need some love inside
All I ask is take me home to mama please take me home to mama's arms"
"There's a fool in the mirror looking back across the bar
Reflections of a woman who's world just fell apart
Now the life we built together and the golden rings are gone
And it's whiskey verses memories and it looks like the race is on
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy, a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today, oh, but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
The cowboys in the corner are making eyes at me
But I just want to be alone with your memory
Now the music's good and country and the whiskey's feeling right
You won't be back but George and Jack will help me through the night
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy, a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today, oh, but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy, a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today, oh, but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind
I'm slowly going crazy, a quarter at a time
He stopped loving her today, oh, but I'm still doing time
I've got Jones on the jukebox and you on my mind"
"Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
Now I hope and pray with each new day
That you'll come a-travelin' home
Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you
I watch the mailman comin'
I wait by the telephone
I meet the trains down at the station
And I spend my nights alone
But now the waitin' is over
And Time has set the scene
'Cos God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me"
"In my world there's no green grass or roses and the rainbow in the sky is grey to me
There's no letter in the mailbox from my baby well how much lonelier can lonely be
When a robin sings to me he sounds unhappy
And the smile is something I no longer see
I can't even hear a little baby laughing well how much lonelier can lonely be
I forsake my very last possession if I could live one yesterday with you
Without you in my arms my world is empty
And cold without the warm love we once knew
Sunrise finds me staring at the ceiling and crying cause the hurt won't let me sleep
Every day without you grows more lonely but how much lonelier can lonely be
But how much lonelier can lonely be"
"Weather man says it's rainin' again
Perfect night for stayin' in
Lookin' at you I don't doubt that it's true
And did I hear you say
Baby put on a smile
Kick your shoes off
And stay a while
Well since you asked me to
I don't mind if I do
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all
Long as I'm makin' time with you
And holdin' you tight
Dim light
Opry radio
I'll whisper baby I love you so
And since you want me to
I don't mind if I do
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all
Long as I'm makin' time with you
And holdin' you tight
Dim light
Opry radio
I'll whisper baby I love you so
And since you want me to
I don't mind if I do
Just as long as it's you baby
I don't mind if I do"
"Found a quarter on the sidewalk
A love letter in a shoebox
I found a snake underneath a rock
Wish I could find forgiveness
A sand dollar on the seashore
An old dresser in an antique store
A rusty whistle in the bottom drawer
Wish I could find forgiveness
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
One sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you
Was too stubborn for my own good
I never listened like I knew I should
I don't deserve it but I wish you would
Find me some forgiveness
For every night I wasn't there
For all the times I didn't care
I admit that it was never fair
Wish I could find forgiveness
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed of someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
But one sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you
I've seen a broom run across a floor
Taking with it what was there before
And that's the kind of clean I came here looking for
It ain't hiding in no bottle on a shelf
Or lying in the bed with someone else
I can't feel it on some Sunday morning pew
But one sleepless night it dawned on me
The peace I need so desperately
Is buried in the one place I can't get to
Girl, it's gotta come from you
Wish I could find forgiveness"
"Sun comes up, it's Tuesday morning
Hits me straight in the eye
Guess you forgot to close the blind last night
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it was me
I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning
The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom
The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping
But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed
Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it
Cause' everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon
Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again
Maybe I'll add a little T.V. too
No milk! God, how I hate that
Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from Jenny
She's got a black eye this morning, `Jen how'd ya get it
She says, `Last night, Bobby got a little bit out of hand
Lunchtime. I start to dial your number
Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke
And anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane
Than go through all that shit again
There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing
Just listening to records and watching the sun falling
Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something
And this spell won't be broken
By the sound of keys scraping in the lock
Maybe tonight it's a movie
With plenty of room for elbows and knees
A bag of popcorn all to myself,
Black and white with a strong female lead
And if I don't like it, no debate, I'll leave
Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten
How strange these streets feel
When you're alone on them
Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion
So I lower my head, make a beeline for home
Seething inside
Funny, I'd never noticed
The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window
Which reminds me that I forgot to close the blind again
Yeah, sure I'll admit there are times when I miss you
Especially like now when I need someone to hold me
But there are some things that can never be forgiven
And I just gotta tell you
That I kinda like this extra few feet in my bed"
"come all you fair and tender ladies
take warning how you court your men
there like a star on a summer morning
they first appear and then there gone
they'll tell to you some loving story
then they make you think that they love you well
then away they'll go to court some other
and leave you there in grief to dwell
(mandolin break)
i wish i was on some tall mountain
where the ivy rocks are black as ink
i'd write a letter to my false true lover
whose cheeks are like the morning dew
(dorbo and fiddle solo)
oh love is handsome love is charming
and love is pretty while it's new
but love grows cold as love grows old
and fades away like morning dew
(repeat chours)"
"The sun goes down in Calvin county
Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime.
Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembling hand
With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.
Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.
I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang
A thousand voices as the church bells rang.
They sang Rosie (Rosie), paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you Paper Roses
But they only cost a dime.
Paper Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie)
She sold you paper roses
But they only cost a dim"
"Aaron Watson/Neal Lowry
You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart
I guess you don't know who your talking too
I'll bet you money no matter how much honey
I'm about to change your point of view
Chorus:
You're messing with man on a mission
And a heart with hard headed ambition
My sites are set on you, there's nothing you can do
You're messing with man on a mission
Darling I declare how dare you to compare
When you ain't ever loved no one like me
Unlike the other boys you may have played like toys
I'm more than a yo-yo on a string

You warned me from the start not to let you break my heart

"She just started liking cheatin?songs
Chorus
She just started liking cheatin?songs
And what's bothering me
I don't know if it's the cheatin?she likes
Or just the melody
I've never had any reason to doubt her
As far as I know she's been true
But lately she's had a different look in her eyes
I wonder if she's seeing somebody new
You can't blame a body for looking
And there's a world of people out there
But I hope she's not taking any closer looks
I tell you lately, frankly I've been scared
Chorus
I've got to admit I do some looking too
But she's the only one I love
She still tells me she loves me
But I wonder if my love's enough

Yeah, I don't know if it's the cheatin?she likes

"A little boy tugged gently
At a soldier's khaki sleeve.
He says, ""Forgive me, mister;
But you've been across I believe.
I see the purple heart you wear
That tells what you've been through.
Perhaps you know my daddy, sir;
'Cause he's a soldier, too.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?
I thought perhaps by chance
You met him there in France,
Or somewhere over there
Across the sea.
It's been so long since daddy went away.
My mommy longs for him both night and day.
I know 'twould make her glad
If you had seen my dad.
Did you see my daddy over there?
The soldier's eyes grew misty
As he watched the boy's face,
For it recalled a memory
That time can not erase;
A buddy lost in action,
The best pal he ever had.
Till death he carried o'er his heart
A picture of this lad.
Did you see my daddy, mister soldier,
When you were fighting over there?

"Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling Oooh
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger (stronger)

Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me

Crying time will start when you walk out the door"
"Scattered Leaves
(Jeremy Lindsey)
Don't you go looking so surprised, baby don't you look so stunned
Didn't I tell you that a cold november'd come?
And deliver the leaves from green to red,
To blowing in the wind stone dead
Well I never used to notice this awful quiet, mmmmh
And fall was just the calm before the next spring riot, mmmhh
Of wildflowers and lunatic rivers -
Sweat jumping off of the skin of love givers, mmh (in the park)
Scattered leaves don't lie
Aw' now baby, baby, quit your cryin'
Like everything that ever mattered, scit-scat scattered
Like every love word you heard
But that's just the way when you walk your days
In the beauty of this world
(repeat)
Pretty little disappointments all in a row
Been about a year since you disappeared through my door
And now you come back with your head on straight,
But I got no love or hate left for you, girl
You must be the daughter of the late, late rose - I'm November's son
And I'm here to tell you, honey, ooh what's done is done
Yeah, I been claimed by the wind and the rain
There ain't no going back, naw there ain't no going back again (for us now)

Saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I try to tell her so
It's hello blues and down the road I go

He held my baby in close this way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know
It's hello blues and down the road I go

Our likes were much the same
We even had our future planned

You say ""hola"", I'll say ""hi""
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five
You better pack a poncho 'cause it sure gets cold up here
Me, I'm headed south for hot women and cheap beer

You can have the house and the bills I pay
Welcome to the good ol' U.S.A.
I'm headed your way, Jose

Cabo San Lucas, maybe go see Chichinitza, I love that word)
Up here we work our asses off just tryin' to get ahead
But you can't spend a dollar if you've worked yourself to death
From what I hear you way of life is an afternoon siesta
Then back to work for a little while for an all night long fiesta
Me, I'm headed your way
Well sounds to me like a pretty fair trade
You say ""hola"", I'll say ""hi""
When I pass you at the border slap me a high five

"Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down, and the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned the ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ooh but the fire went wild
[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down, and the flames climbed higher
And it burned, burned, burned the ring of fire
The ring of fire

"I don't love you anymore
We've all heard those words before
Somebody takes your heart and then
Leaves you the pieces
Lying shattered on the floor
They say that when you close a door
Another one is waiting there
For you to open, if you believe!
[Chorus]
Love will come back
Hit you when you least expect it
Fill in the cracks
Of a broken heart you thought
That you could never mend
You, you can start again!
When you're barely getting by
And it's hard to find the strength to try
And loneliness is all you've known
If you let go, then you will find
[Chorus]
Oh, when you think you've lost the only way
All you really need
Is a little faith
[Chorus]
Just let love return to you
You can start again!"
"You're lookin' for someone
Whose got it all to give
You're lookin' for someone
Who won't care how you live
You're lookin' for someone
Who won't need a love from you
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
Lookin' for someone
Dry your tears when you cry
Lookin' for someone
Turn his back each time you lie
You lookin' for someone
Who walk on when you walk by
But I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one who lets you do
What you want to
I ain't the one who sits still
Let's you be untrue
I ain't the one who know I am lovin' you
No matter what you do
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I just keep lookin' further down the road
Try to find yourself someone
Who likes walkin' along
Someone you play with
And leave you dead by the road
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
I ain't the one, I ain't the one..."
"She called me baby baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
And one day I awoke and she was gone
There's no more baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Lift me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby baby all night long"
"Taste me in your morning coffee
Feel me in the air
When the sunlight warms your skin
Baby, think of me
See me standing there beside you
When you know that your alone
And hear our conversations when you breathe
And baby,
Tell me where you are
If I can't make it
Let me hangout in your heart
I know you don't really need me,
But still you opened up
And I guess that's why this all feels so damn good
You know I don't need you either
But we want the want enough
And if we could deny it
We probably would
And baby,
Tell me where you are
If I can't make it
Let me hangout in your heart
So, I will let the echoes of your laughter
fill my mind
and I won't try to fight the drug you are
And maybe you will welcome for to meet from time to time
And you just let me hang out in your heart
Won't you let me hangout in your heart"
"I WANT THAT FEELIN' AGAIN
(Bill Anderson)
'80 Stallion Music
I want that feelin' again I want that feelin' again
I had it once and it got away and I want that feelin' again
I want that feelin' again I want that feelin' again
I had it once and it got away and I want that feelin' again
I felt it early in the morning I trembled through and through
It was wicked and wild warm and wonderful wakin' up next to you
And I felt it again in the evening soon as the sun went down
That sweet soft sexy feelin' I can wrap my arms around
And I want that feelin' again...
Take me back to the magic in which my soul believed
Where every smile was a rainbow and every kiss was a dream
We had it didn't we have it and it burned didn't it burn
But we blew it didn't we blow it baby mhm make it return
And I want that feelin' again...
And I want that feelin' again...
And I want that feelin' again..."
"When the call hasn't come,
Let me sit with you and wait.
When the other kind does,
Let me help you bear the weight.
Let me gather wood, when the fires gone out.
Let me pray for you, when you're filled with doubt.
Hold your white knuckled hands, when our daughters out too late.
Let me be the one, that's walking with you through the night.
When the morning comes, with its brash and blinding light.
Let me be the one, that's crawling with you through the thorns.
Back to back, we both were born to share this fight.
When you haven't got no sleep,
Let me fix you a cup of Joe.
Let me soak your shirt in tears,
When the tumor starts to grow.
Let me rub your back when the children whine.
Let me push your cart through the five and dime.
Help you hobble down the hall with your IV line in tow.
Let me be the one, that's walking with you through the night.
When the morning comes, with its brash and blinding light.
Let me be the one, that's crawling with you through the thorns.
Back to back, we both were born to share this fight.
There's no one I'd rather walk with,
Through the brier or the flame.
Let me hold you in the darkness,
In the fire, in the rain.
Let me be the one, that's walking with you through the night.
When the morning comes, with its brash and blinding light.
Let me be the one, that's crawling with you through the thorns.
Back to back, we both were born to share this fight.
Back to back, we both were born to share this fight.
Back to back, we both were born to share this fight."
"We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always something in between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still no slate is clean
For better or worse, anybody can
Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's faring
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearing
The shoes he's wearing
They don't make the man
So many people out running around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinking there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be looking for ways
To keep on seeing our better days
We're not chained to what we know
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're faring
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They don't make the man"
"She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart, no
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
Fare thee well, I know you're leavin'
For the new love that you found
The pretty girl that you've been dating
Oh, I've got a feeling, she's gonna put you down
'Cause she don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart, love
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
She uses all the great quotations
She says, all the things I wish I could say
But she's had so many rehearsals
Oh, to her it's just a lover's play
But wait when the final act is over
And you're left standin' all alone
When she takes her bow and makes her exit
Oh well, I'll be there to take you home
She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's tryin' to tear us apart
She don't love you like I love you
If she did, she wouldn't break your heart"
"He used to sing his songs to his Sara Jane the folk singer
His songs filled with love made the mountains ring the folk singer
At first Sara Jane was to be his bride
But as his fame grew she was pushed aside
Sweet mountain girl would say goodbye to the folk singer
He let his hair grown long and he dressed in style the folk singer
His voice was pure and the fans went wild for the folk singer
He said Sara Jane was much too plain
So he left her alone as he gained more fame
But sorrow will come like the mountain rain to the folk singer
[ ac.guitar ]
Lavished in glory fortune at his feet the folk singer
Awoke one morning and he could not speak the folk singer
The doctors said his singing days were through
Thousands wept Sara Jane did too
He couldn't sing now his friends were few the folk singer
Sick at heart in the mountains again the folk singer
Now Sara Jane didn't look so plain to the folk singer
Ah the power of love can do strange things
Cause love has made him sing again
Now he sings for his Sara Jane the folk singer
And once again the mountains ring to the folk singer the folk singer
The folk singer the folk singer"
"Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolf
Play in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolf with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!"""
"I been knowin' you for a little while
You never fail to make me smile
We've never been together is just something we talk about
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
I'm the kind that likes to take it slow.
Well that's just the kind I'd like to get to know.
I just wanna get started, I need you to show me how.
When you gonna come around?
I've been waitin' with a heart full of love
Just for you to say it feels right enough.
I've been a-waiting and a-wondering,
When you're gonna give in and just give it up.
Your love is the sweetest thing I have ever found.
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
Sittin' alone tonight, and just watchin' the clock
My mind is set on you, and it never stops
We've never been together is just something we talk about
Ooh, when you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?
When you gonna come around?"

"He remembers the first time he met her he remembers the first thing she said
He remembers the first time he held her and the night that she came to his bed
He remembers her sweet way of saying honey has something gone wrong
He remembers the fun and the teasing and the reason he wrote her this song
I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away
They would walk down the street in the evening and for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam of their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy and I'd love to go tagging along
Holding hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing her his song
I'll give you a daisy a day dear...
[ steel ]
Now he walks down the street in the evening and he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe he's believing that he's holding her hand like before
For he feels all her love walking with him and he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop and he gives her a daisy a day
I'll give you a daisy a day dear...
I'll give you a daisy a day"
"A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me that you care
Remember when you give you also get your share
Don't let me down I have no time to wait
Tomorrow might not come when the dream is dreamed too late
A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes
That's all I want from you
(A little love that slowly grows and grows not one that comes and goes)
That's all I want from you
(A sunny day with hopes up to the sky a kiss and no goodbye)
That's all I want from you
Don't let me down oh show me
That's all I want from you"
"A lonesome whistle sails through the pines
And finds me crying on my pillow
I wipe the tears and raise up my head
I hear a forest call up low
Listen yonder comes a train
Mama, is that the one he's on
The only thing that keeps me goin' is
Knowin' he's coming back home
And yonder comes a train
I broke his heart and he got on a train
And told me come back anytime
Hope that I must have heard that old lonesome whistle
At least ten thousand times
Listen yonder comes a train
Mama, is that the one he's on
The only thing that keeps me goin' is
Knowin' he's coming back home
And yonder comes a train"
"You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me, your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymore
This plain, old, simple, country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
And you're the one that taught me how to swing"

Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?

"Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heart
Lying deep in a dream of darkness
Where fear has never gone
Each spark of a life is started
Blind and pure to the world we come
Blind and pure to the world we come
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
One is born into a life of hunger
One will be a king or a rich man's son
One will kill out of greed or anger
One will give his life for another one
There are smiles in the lies of innocence
There are blooms in the walls of stone
And we will see ourselves
In the eyes of everyone we have ever known
Everyone we have ever known
And the heart, the heart will ever be a witness
And precious time, no treasure is worth
And the child, the child will carry our existence
Through the days that we have on earth
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Each of us a dancer to the drum
Blind and pure we come
Fast asleep in the dawn of ages
The soul of every child
Has waited to be born a stranger
Underneath the drum of his mothers heart"
"Hello beautiful are you married (sometimes) tell me are you happy (yes sometimes)
But sometimes I feel like I've just got to get away
From the same old existence day after day
Oh haven't you ever felt that way (sometimes)
I can see you're married don't you love her (sometimes)
But you have thought of cheating haven't you (yes sometimes)
Sometimes I long for a warm tender kiss
Just to see if there's anything I might have missed
Oh haven't you ever felt like this (sometimes)
And it's beginning to feel like this might be one of those sometimes
Those one times in a lifetime
I'm aching to hold you kiss and console you drive you right out of your mind
But I know when I do I won't get over you for quite sometimes
I'm aching to hold you..."
"Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more"
"Let me live again
Let me live again
A little taste of heaven that I had before
Was just enough to keep me coming back for more
After loving you, losing you was more than I could stand
Now I'm the ghost of what was once a man
[Chorus]
Let me live again, let me live again
Reach into my heart and light the light of love again
Let me see the sun let this darkness end
Take me back into your arms and let me live again
It would have been much better that we never met
An angel's love like yours is too much to forget
I can't help myself 'cause I can't be stronger than I am
I'm just the ghost of what was once a man"
"While I was out a ridin'
The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn
The moon was bright as a readin' light
For a letter from an old friend back home
And he asked me
Why do you ride for your money
and why do you rope for short pay
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And you're loosin' your share
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there
He said last night he runn in to Jenny
She's married and has a good life
And boy you sure missed the track
When you never come back
She's the perfect professional's wife
And she asked him
Why does he ride for his money
And tell me why does he rope for short pay
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And he's loosin' his share
Well he must've gone crazy out there
Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing
Well I read up the last of my letter
And tore off the stamp for black Jim
And when Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and grinned
He said you know I wonder
Why do they ride for their money
Tell me why do they ride for short pay
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere
And they're loosin' their share
Son, they all must be crazy out there
They ain't never seen the Northern Lights
They ain't never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing"
"The same old house the same old street the same old memories
The same old friends that I meet are always asking me
What happened to our love why did you go away
I smiled at them but died inside a little more each day
I want to go where nobody knows me where no one can ask me about you
I want to go where there are no mem'ries maybe someday I'll forget about you
[ guitar ]
I leave today catch a train somewhere far away
I'll find a way to ease this pain that haunts me night and day
Somewhere in this big big world I'll leave the past behind
I'll wake up and find that you're no longer on my mind
I want to go where nobody knows me..."
"SOMEONE TO GIVE MY LOVE TO

Well I could search from now to the end of the time never find another you
I'm so glad because I know you're mine someone to give my love to
Well I believe my love that you're one of the kind for there's no one else like you
You're the light of my life so let it shine someone to give my love to
Well I find happiness is lovin' you and I'll do my best to make your dreams come true
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth for my place will be with you
Well I have taken you for better or worse someone to give my love to
Well I find happiness is lovin' you and I'll do my best to make your dreams come true
Days of man-and-wife-time are precious few I will spend them all with you
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you someone to give my love to
Mhmm mhmm mhmm mhmm
Well you're the light of my life so let it shine shine on me my whole life through
Well you're the light of my life so let it shine I need someone like you"
"I hear the train a comin' it's comin' round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
And a train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me son
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cry
[ dobro ]
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car
Probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free
But those people keep on movin' that's what tortures me
If they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it over a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
"Down in the valley while on my knees
I asked my Jesus carry please
He promised that He'd take care of me
If I would lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father, I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy to your soul
When I am lonely, when I am sad
My Jesus comes and makes me glad
He is the dearest friend I've have had
I want to lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
I 'll be your father, I'll be your mother
I'll be your sister and your brother
He said if I be lifted up
I'll bring joy, joy, joy to your soul"
"She lives right there off of Rutledge Avenue
She has a few friends but she only has a few
Her next door neighbor plays his music way too loud
She often complains but they play it anyhow
What is a girl supposed to do?
Living alone can have you so confused
But remember now
It won't be too long, girl
Find out where you belong
When you're feeling afraid and alone
Just remember two words, hold on
She works all day to put herself through school
'Cause financial aid doesn't seem to cover food, no, no, no, no
Every morning she rides on the bus to make her gains
It's easy to attain but so hard to sustain, yeah
What is a girl supposed to do
Living alone can have you so confused
But remember now
It won't be too long, girl
You find out where you belong
Whether you're feeling afraid and alone
Just remember two words, hold on
She's coping with pain of things she left behind
Multiple pressures that cloud her mind
And she feels it, her eyes carry no signs of joy
She's tired of rubbing it all the time
Found independence is not so kind
Life ain't easy, all she needs is a friend
Hold on
It won't be too long, girl
Find out where you belong
Feeling afraid and alone
Remember two words, hold on
It won't be too long
Find out where you belong
Feeling afraid and alone
Remember two words, hold on"
"Papa was a simple man papa loved his farming land
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa with something as empty as words
'Cause there's no way to measure the thoughness of timber
And compare it to the softness of birds
Papa was both and yet he was neither just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved and I guess he loved me best of all
For I was the oldest and we were the closest we worked that old farm side by side
I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest the morning that my papa died
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked and what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule and drove the old buggy to town
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery in the shade of a tall maple tree
Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me
We gave him a funeral fit for a king and then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place he just might feel closer to God
The women were crying as they passed by papa the men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourness had gone when I looked up and noticed this white haired old man
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane his voice was shaky and low
I had to look twice before I rocognized him he used to work for us a long time ago
They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
I went out to the homeplace to tell him goodbye
They told me that you done brought him to town
I remember your papa used to say that when he died he didn't have but one request
He wanted to be burried out dare on that farm
He said there wadn't nowhere else that he could rest
When I heard what you'd done I fatched me a shovel found me an old paper sack
I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back
I hope you don't mind if I just sorta scatter these few little pieces of clay
It ain't gonna mess up your pretty green grass he just might sleep better this way
Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa"
"Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I'm tempted, my darling
To steal you away
Don't let me cross over
Stay out of my way
You know that I love you
And I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartaches
At love's cheating line
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And could never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be Heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
I tried to forget you
But what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying
That you love me too
I know if I lose you
Not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear
But I can't help myself
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line
You belong to another
And could never be mine
I know one step closer
Would be Heaven divine
Don't let me cross over
Love's cheating line"
"No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows, yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrows
And I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give any more
Can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give any more
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows, yes, it shows"
"South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a vision in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she smiled as she whispered manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana
For our tomorrow never came
South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white, by candle light, she knelt to pray
But the mission bells told me, that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way"
"Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know
She's the best thing in this life
Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about working overtime
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind
Aw but it crossed his
Early last summer
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave in
And now he wishes he could stop himself
But theres no easy way
So he lays down with his lover
And silently he prays
Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know
In his heart and soul
He knew he was playing a game he could never win
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way
To fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling
Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know"
"2 a.m., dashboard lights
Oh God, it seems I've been on the road all night
Got momma?s picture on the seat beside me
Oh, how I love what I left behind me
But I'm ready to face the dawn of a new day
Gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My heart's wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day
This old truck and one suitcase
Guitar in the bed, I hope it doesn't rain
Got a pocket full of dreams I've been saving
Paid my dues, done some praying
Now I'm on my way to the dawn of a new day
Yeah, gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My hearts wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day
The wind is at my back
That horizons calling me
Gotta keep on rollin?, keep on going
Keep on movin? like a runaway train
My hearts wide open and I ain't slowing down
Till the sun hits my face in the dawn of a new day
Dawn of a new day"
"They ask me, how we do it'
And I tell them, we love each other
There's really nothing to it
It's easy, we love each other so
And we always will, and I know
We found it long ago, and now, it's sure
That it's the kind to last forever
They ask me, can we make it'
And I tell them, we love each other
If there's trouble, can we take it'
And I tell them, we love each other
More than we ever have before
And they should know
When they ask us, how we do it"
"Early this morning, he knocked on my door
Early this morning he knocked on my door
I said ""Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go""
Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side
Me and The Devil are walkin' side by side
Well, I'm goin' to beat my man until I get satisfied
He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, babe, you know you ain't treating me right
He says I don't do him right
That I dog him around
Well, it must be this old evil spirit
So deep down within the ground
You may bury my body down by the highway side
... Oh, babe I don't care what you do with my body
You may bury my body down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit can catch a Greyhound bus and ride
Early this morning, he knocked on my door
Now me and The Devil are walking side by side
Side by side"
"Won't you tell me Molly darling
That you love none else but me
For I love you Molly darling
You are all the world to me
Oh tell darling that you love me
Put your little hand in mine
Take my heart sweet Molly darling
Say that you will give me time
Molly fairest sweetest dearest
Look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling?
Let your answer be a kiss
Molly fairest sweetest dearest
Look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling?
Let your answer be a kiss"
"There's a little black train a-comin',
Set your business right
There's a little black train a-comin'
And it may be here tonight
Go tell that ballroom lady
All dressed in the worldly pride
That death's dark train is comin'
Prepare to take a ride
God sent to Hezekiah
A message from on high
You'd better set your house in order
'For you must surely die
He turned to the wall and, weeping
We see him hear in tears
He got his business fixed all right
God spared him fifteen years
There's a little black train a-comin',
Set your business right
There's a little black train a-comin'
And it may be here tonight
See that train with engine?
And one small baggage car
Your idle thoughts and wicked deeds
Will stop at the judgment bar
Oh, the man in darkness
Cares not for the gospel light
Till he suddenly heard the whistle blow
With the little black train in sight
There's a little black train a-comin',
Set your business right
There's a little black train a-comin'
And it may be here tonight"
"He grew up in a time,
When a third-grade education,
Was all the school you needed,
To work the family farm.
He'd take time off on Sunday,
Him and all his family,
warm a pew,
And give thanks to the Lord.
There was no gray, only black and white.
Didn't need no-one to tell him,
What was wrong or right.
'Cause he had God, Family, and Country.
He set aside his plow,
In early 1940,
Said goodbye to his small town,
And put on the Army green.
Hard Times on the front lines,
Writin' letters on wet paper,
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen.
His was a generation,
That answered without question.
They knew they had to win,
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God, Family, and Country.
On the coffee table,
Sits the family Bible,
Where just last year he added,
A little boy to the family tree.
There's the folded flag they gave us,
On the day he left us.
But the thing that I remember most,
Is the way that he...
Believed...
In God, Family, and Country...
Ohhh, we've got God...
Family...
And Country......"
"Oh I said a little prayer tonight before I came on stage
I came walking past the drivers and the locals on the union wage
I asked the good lord up in heaven, let me treat the music right
Then I prayed that Detroit goes wild tonight
Seven pickers and all our gear in a rental van
Playing music, never sleeping and working on a neon tan
We played the barn down in Sanford, Florida
For Bev Roberts out in Camden Park
We plugged it in up east at Bull Run and the place went dark
Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the hard working boys in the crew
Well it was one big party but the business called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new
Oh the stories we could tell if it weren't for the code of the road
About the buckboard bear creek cowboys and the grizzly rose
You know the weather turned bad in Scottsdale
A tornado nearly stole the show
But we just danced in the rain and listened to the thunder roll
Back when the old stuff was new
Hats off to the KC, Opry and the Ella gurus
It was one big party, Uncle Joe you know we owe it to you
Back when the old stuff was new
No rules, young fools, comin' from the old school
Taking on the world alone
Next date, can't wait, tearing up the interstate
Every place we played was home
Balls out, no doubt this is what it's all about
Beggin' for a place to play
Swingin' with our low friends, prayin' that it never ends
Wouldn't trade a single day
Back when the old stuff was new
Back before the buses and the hard workin' boys in the crew
It was one big party, but the papers called it payin' our dues
Back when the old stuff was new
Hey it's still one big party
You can call it whatever you choose
You make me feel like the old stuff is new"
"Satan, Yer Kingdom Must Come Down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Satan yer kingdom must come down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Satan yer kingdom must come down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
Shout til I tear your kingdom down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Shout til I tear your kingdom down"
"How does a homing pigeon know his way back home alone to Ruth
A Ruth that he has never ever flown
Is it because his mate is waiting there that makes him beat his golden wings
Against the air until he's own
But he must go where his heart tells him there is nothing else that he can do
He's heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you
It's nature's way and the need is strong
It's the need to be in the place where you belong
What is the drive that drives a Simon on to spawn her eggs alone
The rivers and the streams where she was born
She fights the rapids and she scorn the rats and snakes that drag her down
And leave her graceful silver body torn
But she must go where her heart tells her there is nothing else that she can do
She's heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you
It's nature's way and the need is strong
It's the need to be in the place where you belong
Sometimes I say I'll stay away from you to see if I can break
The magic spell that binds me to your side
Then nighttime falls and something calls and like a swallow heading back
I must run onto your arms I'll fly
'Cause I must go where my heart tells me there is nothing else that I can do
I've heard a call a comeback call the call that always brings me back to you"

"Southern lights and how planes fly
Some things I'll never understand
Like me here again tonight
At your memories command
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried, I just don't get it
You've still got it
Turn the page, close the book
Put it on a shelf and let it be
That promise made was all it took
For you to make a lier out of me
Next thing I'm fighting for this heart of mine
I just can't forget the night I lost you
It's still a mystery after all this time
Though I've tried, I just don't get it
You've still got it"
"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.
He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.
She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man."
"I wish I could come back to you dear cause I know that you want me to
But too much water has run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross dear too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
Now don't think for a moment that I blame only you
We both killed the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces that you can't find
Well there's too many rivers to cross dear."
"Darlin' after you left I got that promotion
They transferred me out to La Jolla right on the ocean
And now I'm makin' more money than I can stand
I've got a house on the beach and a bunch of new friends
Oh, you oughta hear what they say
Tellin' me that I've got it made
But
I've been better
Yeah, I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here, as I write this letter
Oh, I've been better
Well I've been seein' a girl that I met out in Spring Valley
She's havin' the time of her life, least that's what she tells me
She says it's love and to tell you the truth
I've tried my best to feel that way too
Oh, but I always realize
When I look into her eyes
That
I've been better
Yeah, I miss those times when we were still together
Right now lookin' back
I don't think the past has ever been this clear
And I realize sittin' here, as I write this letter
Oh, I've been better"
"Between The Stones And Jones
Written by: Cyril Rawon, Kim Tribble, Kim Williams
I met her at the Jukebox, she was playing the Rolling Stones
She said, Honky Tonk Women, now thats my favourite song
Well I dropped in a quarter, and I played the Race is on
We fell somewhere between the stones and Jones
(Chorus)
Somewhere between big lips and no show
Country and Rock & Roll
We found a little common ground we can dance on
Somewhere between a two step and a stagger
The possum and Jagger
We fell somewhere between the Stones and Jones
Cant get no satisfaction, was the next song that she played
Well I punched B 11, he stopped loving her today
Before the night was over our love was going strong
We fell somewhere between the stones and Jones
(Chorus)
(Break)
(Chorus)
We fell somewhere between the Stones and Jones"
"I'm going away for a while
Don't care how many miles
It takes it get wherever I go
As long as I can take it slow
And take my time
Finding a brand new heart
Making a breand new start
Been watching the whole world
Fall apart and the pieces
Keep on breaking, so
If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
I'll be kicked back in the shade
Nothing but buzz in my veins
Nobody knowing my name
I'm just a face and a place
A dot on the map
And it's too short of a life
I gotta enjoy the ride
I finally get to feeling alive
I'm taking off, I'm flying
And here I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile
And just outside this bar
There's a shop with a postcard
I'll write your name
Wish you were here
And I'll be back when things are clearer
So here I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile"
"There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
And it comes in black and it comes in white
And I'm frightened by those that don't see it
When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesn't change by the man that's elected
If you're loved by someone, you're never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon you that's flooded in light
And in the fine print
They tell you what's wrong and what's right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in
And demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So I'll scream 'til I die
And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me what's wrong and what's right
There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light
And I'm frightened by those who don't see it"
"There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky
And twice as many tear drops
there to wash it down
Every one's another lullaby
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a world of trouble
Trying to take its turn
I can hear it shaking underground
And half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize
Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
You're the only one and only
Why'd you go and leave me lonely"
"There you were standin' in the shadows
Well I just looked where I don't see
I'm still pretendin' I don't need you
I won't let you know you're killin' me
Like some big black widow spider
You know just how to catch your prey
I'm actin' like it doesn't matter
And you sneak up from behind and whisper my name
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Well I think you're playin' with me darlin'
You like to see what you can do
Well I should be fishin' for Blue Marlin
Instead of being hooked again by you
There goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my act of playin' it cool
And there go the words
I meant to say
There go the games
I wanted to play
There goes my heart fallin' for you
Yeah there goes your paralyzin' eyes
There goes your tantalizin' smile
There goes my heart fallin' for you
There goes my heart fallin' for you"

"Little Susie Shallow Throat
Little Susie Shallow Throat was lonely
All the girls all made fun of her at school
'Cause no matter how she tried
She could not get a dick inside
Her shallow throat
Shallow throat
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
Cucumbers and sausages
They just would not fit
She tried 'em all
The football team all tried to give her lessons
She practiced but she threw up on the coach
Not one man on the squad
Ever shot his wad in Susie's throat
Shallow throat
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
Cucumbers and sausages
They just would not fit
She tried 'em all
The drum major was a boy named Slick
Who had a very little bitty dick
She licked it sucked and stroked it
'til Slick thought she might choke
He never knew
She had a shallow throat
Hot Dogs and bananas were too big
Cucumbers and sausages
They just would not fit
She tried 'em all
She finally learned to deep throat after all
Since she met Slick she's really had a ball
But Slick he's kind of lonesome
With Susie and the kid
'Cause though his dick just fits her throat
Her pussy's much too big"
"Ridin 'round the county drinkin from a jar. Big blue canoe up on top of the car. Hop in darlin', don't be a stranger. Sit back and relax, cause you ain't in no danger.
Well Bogalusa spells trouble to me, I'd rather stay out here under the trees. With the wind on the lake, the stars in the sky, what else do you need to make you feel high?
Chorus: I want to ride with you in my blue canoe. Baby lets go ridin. slippin and a sliding. In my blue canoe.
You bring the ice chest and I'll get the bait. Meet me at the lake and don't be late. Cause all this hangin around, is draggin me down. I gotta get behind the wheel and get the hell out of town. Too many people, too many cars, to many nights in too many bars. My noggin's gettin' soggy and my spirit's are saggin. Time to take a ride in my blue water wagon."
"From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen and walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king with no regrets I stackled the cards last night
And Lady Luck played her hand just right to make me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen you made me king of your heart
[ guitar ]
For just a little while I thought..."
"She drove South I-95 straight through Carolina
She didn't use no damn map to find her way
She pulled off on a state route just north of Charlotte
And took mostly county roads the rest of the day.
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me
Would you all step back? so a girl might to get started.
And then he won't have to look twice to see.
She drove up across the yard and though his momma's garden
Didn't touch the brakes, she slammed right into his Chevrolet
Tossed out his clothes, boots, Bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster
Then shot the whole mess neon green, a can of DuPont spray
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me,
Would you all step back? so a girl might to get started,
And he won't have to look twice to see.
She said I'll give you an intentional heartache
That'll hurt a lot worse than the one that you left in me
And tell your little tramp to step back, so your new ex-wife can get started
And you won't have to look twice to see
She said watch this!
Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green,
Said ""Connie put that can of spray paint down!""
Just watch this,
Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too
Put the can down Connie!
She give it hell with that can of spray paint
He kept yelling at her
Put the can down
And she sprayed to him ,
Then she did a little dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster,
Just kind of a hoochie coochie
""Alright! Connie,""
He said ""I saw ya Connie, now put it down""
Said ""watch this,"" run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo
And she sprayed tramp
On the hood, on the back of the house
They tried to call her sister
What was that girl's name?
Said ""you gotta come get this girl!""
Nancy, I think. Said watch this,
Said look here,
Look here. Watch this!
She run that girl back up on the porch.
She was screaming Tramp this and Tramp that
Oh yeah she gave him an intentional heartache,
""Alright , alright Connie I heard ya.""
His momma was cryin' in on the floor,
His daddy said ""told ya that girl was gonna get like that""
She said watch this here."
"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone"
"I look out across corn rows from a dirt road
Baby's kicked back in the front seat
Got her bare fit hanging out the window
We take a trip down memory lane
Dirt on the truck, no chance of rain
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way
And if it don't show up, we'll be alright
Because folks round here wouldn't take a million
For a different life
[Chorus]
Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I wont ever get too far away
From Home sweet home
Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face
Knowing that this place is blessed
By God's amazing grace
[Chorus]
Know matter I go
Or where the road might leave
This little speck on the map, will always be
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm coming home."
"On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and fears
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago
Now I knelt at my mother's knee
For I weary, I was heartsick, I was blue
She said, son lift up your eyes to Him
To Him up in the skies
And you'll grow, oh yes, son
You'll grow tall and strong
Like the mighty oaks
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
Down on your knees
You can go taller than trees"
"Her little heart beats so fast
You can almost hear it breakin' down the hall
As we fight the final round
Sounds like we're tearin' down the walls
He packs a bag, screams goodbye
I yell wait as he walks out the door
Then from the lips of a child
I found wisdom that I've never heard before
She said, ""Momma, let him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
Momma, pull yourself together
We've all survived the war""
She said, ""Momma, let him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
That one's been answered
Amen, praise the Lord""
Yesterday she was a baby in my arms
Now just look at her holdin' me together as I fall apart
It turned out that the best for her
Wound up to be the best for me
Guess you never get too old to learn
That you can't be too young to teach
She said, ""Momma, let him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
Momma, pull yourself together
We've all survived the war""
She said, ""Momma, let him go
We don't have to pray about that anymore
That one's been answered
Amen, praise the Lord""
That one's been answered
Amen, praise the Lord"
"Well, sometimes I wish we'd bought the kind
That folds out into a bed
But it ain't too bad if you lay on your side
And use the armrest for you head
Yeah, the springs are sprung and the center sags
And the stuffing is sticking out
But it's times like these, she ain't happy with me
I thank God for this old couch
Yeah, right about now, she's as P.O.'ed
As I've ever seen her be
And this pillow and blanket and a mighty dirty look
Tells me where I'm gonna sleep
I learned a long time ago, don't say nothing
And soon, she'll simmer down
And with a little bit of luck, we'll kiss and make up
Sitting right here on this old couch
Yeah, this old couch is a pretty safe place
While she blows off a little steam
Well, she's mad as hell but that's alright
She ain't getting rid of me
'Cause there ain't no quitting, just forgiving and forgetting
That's what love's about
And we both know, I'll never go no further
Than this old couch
It might take five minutes or take five days
It really all depends
On how long it takes for the begging and the pleading
To finally start soaking in
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm gonna learn
Not to stick my big foot in my big mouth
Yeah, and maybe then I won't have to spend
So much time alone, yeah, right
Yeah, this old couch is a pretty safe place
While she blows off a little steam
Well, she's mad as hell but that's alright
She ain't getting rid of me
'Cause there ain't no quitting, just forgiving and forgetting
Yeah, that's what love's about
Yeah, and we both know, I'll never go no further
Than this old couch, yeah, this old couch
Yeah, one potato, two potato, three potato, four potato
I'm a couch potato
""Hey honey, you still mad?
I'm sorry, a lot"""
"Seger was singin' words I could believe in
And Mainstreet was my street that night
So I called up Samantha
And asked her the chance of us runnin' out neath the moon light
Well shes not with me now, she can always be found
When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
My 18th summer I was a cocky up and come'er
Crankin' up ""Born To Run""
Turn left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son
My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you not I told you so
When I hear mama tried I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road
And I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
So I labor for hours 'cause I know the power of a song
When a song hits you right
Poured my soul into stories of life
Hopin' someone will hear one tonight
Maybe my voice will cut through the noise
And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams
The sound of a million dreams"
"With pen in hand
You sign your name
Today at five
I'll be on that train
And you'll be free
And I'll be alone
So alone
If you think
We can't find the love we once knew
If you think
I can't make everything up to you
Then I'll be gone
And you'll be on your own
You'll be on your own
Can you take good care of Jenny
Can you take her to school everyday
Can you teach her how to play
All the games that little girls play
Hear what I say
Can you teach her how to roll up her hair
Can you make sure each night that she says her prayers
Well if you can do all these things
Then maybe she won't miss me
Maybe she won't miss me
And tonight as you laid in that big lonely bed
And you look at that pillow
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
Will you have no desire
To kiss me
Or to hold me"
"I'm gonna walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
I'm gonna walk that milky white way some of these days
I'm gonna walk up and take my stand gonna join the Christan Band
I'm gonna walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
I'm gonna tell my mother hurry when I get home
I'm gonna tell my mother hurry when I get home
Well well well I wanna tell my mother hey
I wanna tell my mother hey when I shake the hands that day
That's when I walk that milky white way some of these days
I'm gonna meet God Father and God Son
I'm gonna mee God Father and God Son
I wanna tell them bout my troubles in this world I just come from
That's when we walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days
That's when we walk that milky white way oh Lord some of these days"
"(Tom McKeon, Ron Peterson)
We'd worked ourselves senseless
Been bustin' down fences
Drivin' dry cattle, no water in sight
As we sat 'round the fire
And cursed the barbed wire
A stranger broke into our light
Not knowin' no better
Some fool went for leather
But a whispered ""I wouldn't""
Put an end to the fight
Then he said, ""I'm for hire.
""You need a rider.
""And I don't mind ridin' at night.""
[Chorus]
Go light on the Night Hawk
He don't smile, he don't talk
To strangers, and seldom to friends
And you'll do well to listen
When he asks you to leave him alone
He won't ask you again
Though the man is a myst'ry
The story is hist'ry
How a range fire came
Like a thief in the night
Took his young wife and babies
His would-bes and maybes
And burned out the love in his life
[Chorus]
Go light on the Night Hawk
He don't smile, he don't talk
To strangers, and seldom to friends
And you'll do well to listen
When he asks you to leave him alone
He won't ask you again"
"There must be a reason
We first got together
There must have
Been a reason
We used to talk forever
It's hard to see now
Cause it's easier to think
Of what went wrong
I could keep
Pointin' fingers
I could stay mad as hell
Just let my anger linger
But as far as I can tell
I've just got to let it go
If I want to move on
So I'll think about
How you made me laugh
Not think about
How you made me cry
Think about
How we both swore
We'd love each other
Till we died
Forget about
Who's to blame
Just remember
Your smilin' face
Well it's a choice
I've had to make
So I'll think about you
That way
Hoah
Seems like
I paint you now
In colors of forgiveness
I lost the pain somehow
And in it's place
There is this
Part of me that sees you
In the light
I saw you in before
So I'll think about
How you made me laugh
Not think about
How you made me cry
Think about
How we both swore
We'd love each other
Till we died
Forget about
Who's to blame
Just remember
Your smilin' face
Well it's a choice
I've had to make
So I'll think of you
That way
Hey
So I'll think about
How you made me laugh
Not think about
How you made me cry
Think about
How we both swore
We'd love each other
Till we died
Forget about
Who's to blame
Just remember
Your smilin' face
Well it's a choice
I've had to make
(Choice I've had to make)
Well it's a choice
I've had to make
So I'll think of you
That way
Yeah I'll think of you
That way
I'll think of you
That way"
"What changed the look in his eyes?
What made the change in his heart?
What changed his mind about the love we had?
What's tearing us apart?
What's come over my baby?
He's not the same as before
What's come over my baby?
My baby don't love me anymore
Can it be his old love is back again
Or has he found someone new?
Can it be with time he's just grown tired of me?
What's our love come into?
What's come over my baby?
He's not the same as before
What's come over my baby?
My baby don't love me anymore"
"[Chorus]
Velvet chains softly hold me
Keep me from strayin' to another one's arms
Locked in your love I will remain
I don't wanna be free from your velvet chains
You keep the door wide open
You don't lock me in
I come and go
Your never ask me where I've been
You know I'm faithful
Yes, I'm bound to be
Your lovin' arms
Put these velvet chains on me
[Chorus: x2]
I don't wanna be free from your velvet chains
Velvet chains"
"He's just a singer, a natural born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs
He's not a walk-behinder, he's a new note finder
But his name's a reminder
Of a blues man that's already gone
So he started drinkin', took some things that messed up his thinkin'
He was sure sinkin' when she came along
He was alone in the spot light, not too much left in sight
She changed all that one night
When she sang him this song
Hey baby, I love you, Hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me
You're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life
Runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine a little love light
Down on that blues man
He got so sick from speedin', all the things they said he was needin'
If he was to keep on pleasin' all of his fans
He got cuffed on dirt roads, he got sued over no shows
She came and took all that old load
Down off that blues man, and he sang
Hey baby, I love you too, Hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band
I'm over forty years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out
With this blues man
He's over forty years old now, nights would be so cold now
If she hadn't hung around
With that blues man"
"One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Once upon a mountain top, a castle stood
Carved out of rock and stone, iron and wood
Then one day a grain of sand
Grew into an iron latch
Undermined the mountain side
And the castle tumbled down
One, one, one grain of sand
A lover spoke an angry word that led to tears
The tears led to a quarrel, love disappeared
That word was like a grain of sand
That undermined the things they've planned
It shook up the house of love
And brought it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
Just one little grain of sand
Can change your life and ruin your plans
Undermine your house of love
Bring it tumbling down
One, one, one grain of sand
One, one, one grain of sand"
"Lately I've been runnin'
Into our old friends
And somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell them what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doin' now
And in case you're wonderin' too
I breathe in I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
'Til you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
Until then
I breathe in and breathe out
I've got every reason
To find someone new
'Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Girl, left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turning round
And my heart believes you're gone
I breathe in I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
'Til you find
I'm that someone you can't live without
Until then
I breathe in and breathe out"
"Empty all my pockets take away my gold
Stripp me of my innocence leave me in the cold
Rob me of my patience and mess up my mind
If that's all it takes to love you girl
Then a truer love you'll never find than mine
Set my very soul on fire burn it to the ground
Take my little loveless world turn it upside down
Rob me of my patience...
[ strings ]
Here I am on bended knees I'll do anything to please
Your kind of love to set me free if I could only make you see me
Rob me of my patience..."
"I like my steak well done, my taters fried
Football games on Monday night
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my coffee black
Ol' TV shows
My women hot and my beer ice cold
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my fishin' holes, lightnin' bugs
Flatt n' Scruggs, and my woman's love
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man
I like my Wrangler jeans, cowboy boots
Cornbread and beans and country roots
It's just who I am
A meat and potato man"
"Can I love you more?
Than I do right now
Let's find out,
Let's find out,
Let's find out,
Could it be forever
Just a little bit more
Let's find out
Let's find out
Turn the radio on,
Find a little
Rock and roll
Roll the windows down
Let's go
Does anybody really know
What tomorrow will bring
Close your eyes,
Jump on in,
Let love do the rest
All the worries in the world,
Don't mean anything
Just keep sayin'
Just keep sayin'
Just keep sayin'
Yeah
Can there be more fire
In a single kiss
Let's find out
Let's find out
Let's find out
Baby from now on
There ain't nothing but blue sky
Let's find out
Let's find out
Let's find out
Baby you're a little bit scared
That's only natural
Take a hold on my hand
Let's go
Does anybody really know
What tomorrow will bring
Close your eyes,
Jump on in,
Let love do the rest
All the worries in the world,
Don't mean anything,

"I slept last night in the bus depot in Pittsburg
Tonight I walk the streets of Baltimore
Ain't no telling where I'll be tomorrow my baby don't care and I don't anymore
I've grown restless (like the wind that blows) restless (like nobody knows)
I'm running from the one I'm longing for
Oh I'm restless (and I can't stand still) restless (and I never will)
My baby don't care and I don't anymore (restless restless)
My baby fell in love with a man in Frisco
Left me standing in the midnight freezing cold
I took a train back east to West Virginia
But there ain't no taking this aching out of my soul
I've grown restless"
"When I was a rover, met a four leaf clover
She was irish as the day was long
I thought she'd give it to me maybe
Now she's married with a baby
I've been dodging bullets all along
Man, we would creep but never lost no sleep
I would cut cat nip into the weed
Nobody was the wiser but they could have been
Higher and it meant more money for me
Here's to not getting caught, doctor it's only a graze
Spinning like a top, running like a villain and the years are going by like days
School bus, I got on it, I was nearly catatonic
I couldn't speak a goddamn word homeroom class
Forge a hall pass and we would get higher than the birds
My foolish nature, the chase for the paper, I would deal in the broad daylight
18 years old, head full of psilocybin and howling at the moon all night
Here's to not getting caught, doctor it's only a graze
Spinning like a top, running like a villain and the years are going by like days
Small town shadows, clean out of sight
Nothing to fear but the coming of that morning light
Ducking and dodging and diving for that rent
If it couldn't be broken, it could be bent
Washing dishes, stealing kisses, making our deals on the side
She said are you ready honey, we got gas money, going on a real long ride
Lying like a rug, prescription drugs, old guitars, new girlfriends
Everybody shunned me, I just thought that it was funny and I'd do it all over again
Here's to not getting caught, doctor it's only a graze
Spinning like a top, running like a villain and the years are going by like days"
"You ought to see deacon Jones
When he rattles the bones,
Old parson Brown foolin' 'roun like a clown,
Aunt Jemima who is past eighty three,
Shoutin' ""I'm full o' pep!
Watch yo' step!, watch yo' step!
One legged Joe danced aroun' on his toe,
Threw away his crutch and hollered, ""let 'er go!""
Oh, honey, hail! hail! the gang's all here
For an Alabama jubilee
Mandolins, violins,
Hear the darkies tunin' up, the fun begins,
Come this way, don't delay,
Better hurry, honey dear, or you'll be missin'
Music sweet, rag-time treat,
Goes right to your head and trickles to your feet,
It's a reminder, a memory finder
Of nights down in old Alabam'.
Hear that flute, it's a beaut,
And the tunes it's tootin', tootsie, ain't they cute?
Let's begin, it's a sin,
To be missin' all this syncopated music!
Oh, you Jane, once again
Give your legs some exercise to that refrain,
Boy, that's what makes me so dreamy and takes me
Back home to my old Alabam'."
"Wild flowers along the road
Are pretty to the eye
Make a lovely spray then they start to dry
You and I we sure had our fun
Our moment in the sun
The party rages on til the spirits gone
Here's looking at you
To the years
To the times you were sincere
Like a bottle of wine
That's only good opened in it's time
They say that the strong
Will survive
Well I'm weak but I'm still alive
Saying good-bye
As I changed to a butterfly
Here's looking at you
A child looks at a lion's eye
Lying in a cage
Only sees the good underneath the rage
A challenge is more than an open door
Like wolves feed on the sheep
I don't want to fight for what I cannot keep"
"Lord I wish I was a catfish swimmin' in the sea
With lots of pretty women Lord it's fish after me
And I'd move then I'd move then I'd move to Kansas City
Honey baby where they don't want you
Now they call me pretty papa the smallest guy in town
The women are crazy bout me but my good gal turned me down
She done move she done move she done move to Kansas City
Honey baby where they don't want you
[ guitar ]
Now I walk upon the broadway looking down the peel
Looking for the gal that they call Lucille
She done move she done move she done move to Kansas City
Honey baby where they don't want you
Now foolin' round to Nashville as blue as I can be
Looking for the blond that made a champ out of me
She done move she done move she done move to Kansas City
Honey baby where they don't want you"
"Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold
But I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the strength to be true
Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you but darling I do
Please help me I'm falling in love with you"
"Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then"
"Met ya out on the west coast
fell in love in Frisco and brought you home
you said you loved this small town
we tried to put some roots down of our own
But the city lights burned so bright
in your memory
guess they were always calling you
away from me
Chorus:
You should be good to go
I topped it off, I checked the oil
there's a map on the dash,
but I guess you know your way
And I have to laugh I guess
as you point your Eldorado west
you changed my life
you changed your name
but you never changed your California plates
Bet you missed the beaches
warm ocean breezes rollin' in
but I'll miss the cool nights
nothin' but the firelight on your skin
Girl dry your eyes I know you tried
to make it work
but in your heart your
still a California girl

"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams
You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
Gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
Gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams
Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
For I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town
The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigolette"
"You pretend you don't see you say just let things be
And perhaps she'll come back to stay
You tell friends you still care that is just as she's there
That you love her so much more each day
But after awhile the pain stops hurting after awhile the heart cries no more
After awhile the tears stop their falling things get better after awhile
[ piano ]
When she left you said go from to him then you'll know
Who really has more love to give
You told her she'd come home but it's weeks she's still gone
And you wonder how long you can live
But after awhile...
Things get better after awhile"
"WHY DO I PUT UP WITH YOU
WITH BETTIE HUSKY
(Hank Mills - David Wilkins)
'66 Johnny Bienstock Music, BMI
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you and the little things you do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
You bring the kitchen to the bedroom while you're readin'
And I wake up with cheese and crackers in my hair
And when I go to take a shower I start screamin'
Cause I get lost in your nylon jungle there
Oh I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
You throw your clothes around the room in no directions
And then you wonder why my work is never done
The little workshop in the basement never seen you
I tell myself if the TV program's coming on
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
At two o'clock I call and say we're goin' dancin'
To give you time to make your face and fix your hair
And eight o'clock we're runnin' in and out of dress shops
Because you say you haven't got a thing to wear
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do
On Friday night you promised me that we'll go shopping
Because on Saturdays the sale is going off
But in the morning you say honey I'm so sorry
I have forgot that today I'm playin' golf
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you and the little things you do
I don't know why I put up with you I put up with you the way I do"
"Hey baby what do you know about how it feels
Honey what do you know about if that's real
Baby what do you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love
Hey baby what do you know about all its dreams
Honey what do you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby what do you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love
For I've been longing to find
Another heart that would know
And it seems like yours just might
Hey baby what do you know about it's first blush
Honey what do you know about the caught up rush
Baby what do you know about what to trust
And what do you know about love, woah no
My heart's so often been wrong
That it still can't be sure
If this finally did come along
Hey baby what do you know about all its dreams
Honey what do you know about Cupid's schemes
Baby what do you know about what that means
And what'd you know about love
Oh take it down
Hey baby what do you know about how it feels
Honey what do you know about if that's real
Baby what do you know about the whole deal
And what'd you know about love
Oh baby, tell me what do you know about the whole deal
And what do you know about love"
"Saturday satan Sunday saint foolin' your neighbors that's what you think
Readin' the good book singin' the hymns
Come Monday morning and he's back to a life of sin
Old brother Brown all week he steals tells everyone this big business deals
The deacon walks by a dollar hits the plate
Tryin' to buy self a ticket to the pearly gates
Old sister Rose on the very first row been a sittin' right there twenty years or so
Never hears a word when the preacher speaks
Too busy talkin' bout the bad girl down the street
Saturday satan Sunday saint...
This little song holds good advice though some people may think it ain't too nice
Well if you're one who's wearing the shoes
Well there's somebody watchin' and you ain't nobody's fool
Saturday satan Sunday saint...
Come Monday morning and he's back to a life of sin"
"(My arms) keep reaching for you
(My lips) keep calling for you
(My shoes keep walking back to you)
I must say that I don't care hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartache starts anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you
[ strings ]
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
For nothing else means half as much as you
Our old world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye
And I can't forget no matter what I do
And my arms keep reaching for you...
(My arms my eyes my lips keep calling for you)
My shoes keep walking back to you"
"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain
And planted some pines in the sand
Every day I looked their way
But just couldn't understand
Why they never grew like I thought they should do
I just couldn't understand why
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through
And today I just happened by
Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I bet you wouldn't know me now
I'll never forget the morning I left
The hum of the bees in the hay
The farther I walk, the harder they talk
How silent it seems here today
There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch
Surrounding the old family graves
And there's one gravestone standing all alone
There waiting to join me in the shade
Tall pines, tall pines
Reaching up for the clouds
Tall pines, tall pines
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs"
"Well I have been a cowboy dang near all my life
That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll
Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes
[ guitar ]
Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah

Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control
And he won't let go
But I'll get back to my cowboy music but sometimes you gotta play a little rock and roll
It's my turn it's about time
[ guitar ]"
"Well a bronc bucked me off up in Cheyenne Wyoming I broke me a couple of bones
My wife up an left me it must be an omen my destiny's being alone
I've been thinkin' of mama out a workin' the yard so I gave her a call on the phone
But I told her I've just been workin' so hard I just ain't had time to go home
Well I've seen Atlanta and I've seen LA and I've rode neath the big Astro Dome
And old Calgary seen a whole lot of me but I just ain't had time to go home
All daddy left was the watch that he carried the pocketknife he used to use
But a pawnshop in Vegas and the woman I married left me with nothin to lose
But I keep on a dreamin' bout a Cadillac car parked by my two story home
And in my dreams I'm a big rodeo star and mama knows I'm commin' home
Well I've seen Atlanta..."
"When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Take me and make me your lover one more time
Close in your arms as before
'Til o'er your shoulder the early morning shines
Then I'll leave you and grieve you no more
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Daises need sunshine and roses need rain
So it was all meant to be
A wild bird needs wings, free to take to the wind
And so it was meant for you and me
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Teardrops will kiss the morning dew"
"Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
Well, they thought I was fast a sleepin'
They thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a peepin'
Or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy,
Then I'm a gonna tell on them
Well, Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the Red Nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot of presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like Daddy
And daddy looked a lot like him
Well, Santa looked like daddy
Or daddy looked like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was a much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney
So momma must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him..."
"The summer wind came blowin' in across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang our song and strolled a golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind
Like painted kites the days and nights went flying by
The world was new beneath the blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
I lost you to the summer wind (the summer wind)
The autumn winds the winter winds have come and gone
And still the days the lonely days go on and on
And guess who sighs these lullabys through nights that never end
My fickle friend the summer wind
The summer wind the summer wind (the summer wind)"
"[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, laugh, love, just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that
Tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
I got a buddy that wakes up
Worryin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the market's strong
I spend my whole week's wages
At the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio
But hey that's alright
[Chorus]
I got a cabin in the country
And the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine
Helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round
I got a woman that fills my heart so full
That it overflows
And how it gets any better than this
Brother I don't know
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, laugh, love, just for today
Gonna take all the trouble and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love
[Chorus]
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love"
"Before there ever came the time that I could realize
That you've meant all the world to me
You turned and I was gone to find the good life I've been missin'
But you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse and back to find the good time
But it took the time like this to make me see
I searched high and low to just to find my reason
But you were all the good there ever was in me
[ steel ]
It's sad to think that much too late I've come to understand
That all the world was laying at my feet
I kicked aside the love that means much more than life just now
And you were all the good there was in me
I went from bad to worse...
Yes you were all the good there ever was in me"
"I flew off to the wild blue yonder
'Cause I had a dream
And I had to go
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder
From the love I shared
With a green-eyed boy
Lips as sweet as mountain honey
A body warm as home made wine
But he had no dreams
And no means for money
But he had me just anytime
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Now he was pretty
With chiseled features
Like the movie stars in the magazines
My first love and the son of a preacher
I fantasized me was James Dean
But the world outside kept pulling at me
Offered me fame, respect, and gold
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion
Expensive cars, so I chose those
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss
That green-eyed boy
Do you think about me
When the nights are long and cold
Do you ever miss me
Do you my green-eyed boy"
"You left me, I left too
I went right out of my head
The old boy they all knew
They all knew was pretty much dead
You know, they say I went crazy
And by ""crazy"" I mean mentally insane
I had a world where I still had you
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again, crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again
I guess what I miss is
The not missin' you most
That feeling on oneness
That every one of us should know
When the hours were ours
And I sit talkin' to the wind
And your soul danced with my soul
Oh I wish I was crazy again
Crazy again, crazy in love
Ignorantly bliss baby
That's what dreams are made of
There was no hurtin'
I lived life without pain
You'd still be in my arms baby
If I was crazy again"
"There they go again,
It happens every time
I try to leave
But they just wont tow the line
They've got a mind of their own
When it comes to you
That's the only time
They tell me what to do
[Chorus]
These boots were made for walking back to you
Cause every time I go,
That's all they want to do
I say goodbye,
But they say we're not through
Cause these boots were made for walking back to you
They're only leather and nails,
A little worn at the seams
But they're convinced they know what's best for me
I say I'm gone for good,
But they're the ones in control
Sometimes I think they own me,
Heart and soul
[Chorus]
These boots were made for walking back to you
Cause every time I go,
That's all they want to do
I say goodbye,
But they say we're not through
Cause these boots were made for walking back to you
I say goodbye,
And they say we're not through
Cause these boots were made for walking,
They might as well do all my talking
Cause these boots were made for walking back to you."
"If I could only win your love
I'd make the most of everything
I'd proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray one dream away
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love
Oh how can I ever say
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love
Oh how (oh how)
can I ever say (can I ever say)
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how
can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love"
"It was long, long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly, I love you
As the waters murmured a tune
Oh, they tell me your love is like a flower
In the springtime blossoms so fair
In the fall then they wither away, dear
And they tell me that's the way of your love
I remember the night, little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
That for me your love would never die
It was spring when you whispered these words, dear
The flowers were all blooming so fair
But today as the snow falls around us
I can see that your love is not there"

"My momma used to tell me son you better get your work done your daddy's coming home at five
And if you ain't all through with the chores you gotta do boy I'm gonna tan you alive
I was glued to the radio listening to my hero singing those sad old songs
Singing them sadder than a one car funeral nobody sings like Jones
I'd take that old kitchen broom up to my room and I'd play it like an old guitar
Or sit out on the porch trying to sing like George dreaming of becoming a star
Well things I never did when I was just a kid made what I am today
See momma used to whoop me with a George Jones album that's why I sing this way
So I ended up in Nashville working at a saw mill just to be close to the stars
I got a little broke but I couldn't ask my folks so I had to hock my old guitar
I still hang around tootsie's orchid lounge thinking he'll walk through that door
But a voice in my mind says you wasting your time cause George don't drink no more
I used to take that old broom up to my room and I played it like an old guitar
Or sit out on the porch trying to sing like George dreaming of becoming a star
Well things I never did when I was just a kid made what I am today
You see momma used to whoop me with a George Jones album that's why I sing this way"
"Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
Verse I:
And the eyes that used to burn for me
Now they no longer look my way
And the love that used to be
Why, it just got lost in yesterday
And if she seems cold to the touch
Well there used to burn a flame
I gave too little, took too much
'Til I erased the painter's name
Mona Lisa lost her smile
The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now

So don't wait around to see if I'm a gonna cry
Instead of tears streaming down my face you'll find a great big smile in their place
You finally said something good when you said goodbye
I don't wanna rush things honey but I'll help you pack
I've been waitin' on you to make a move like that
Don't waste anytime on words my dear you already said what I wanna hear
Yeah you finally said something good when you said goodbye

Better make your move faster honey I'll call a cab
Now don't worry about the money I'll pay the tab
Now you've been talking for nearly a year and at last you said what I wanted to hear
Yeah you finally said something good when you said goodbye
Oh you finally said something good...
Oh you finally said something good when you said goodbye"

Come ride with me cowboys
I'll tell you a story
Out where the whoopin' cranes fly
I'll show you the white bones
Of giants in sandstone
Out where the wind never dies
Come sit by the campfire
I'll sing you a sad song
Of rivers that never return
Play soft on the mouth-harp
Strum slow on the guitar
And leave all the mem'ries to burn
[Chorus]
Roll on, Niobrara
Roll on, Niobrara
Roll on
I'll show you the bright shiny
Ribbon of silver
That flows through the sandhills at dawn
I'll find you the places
Where clear water races
Before all the traces are gone
[Chorus]
Roll on, Niobrara
Roll on, Niobrara
Roll on
So pack up the bedroll
And cinch up the saddle
And head for the red mornin' sky
We'll sing one more song for
The wild Niobrara
Out where the wind never dies
[Chorus]
Roll on, Niobrara
Roll on, Niobrara
Goodbye"
"(Dolly Parton)
Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waitin' for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring
When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life is the thing that I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
She'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take it with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful water flows
Spread your tiny wings
If I could you know that I would fly away with you"
"I was taking every hit from you
you drive by shooting son of a bitch, and I'm done
Oh whoa, I'm done
Who told you you could rewrite the rules, and do you
really take me for a goddamn fool 'cause I'm done,
Oh whoa, I'm done
And you can drag me out before some authority
If that's what you have to do to feel like you can punish me
but I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't keep the peace anymore
With your dogs, with your dogs, at my door
You've been puncing my weaknesses, slandering my name
you spent all your time trying to place your blame, and I'm done
Ohhh, I'm done
I used to think I owed the best part of me to soothe the holes in your life and the cracks in your seams I'm done
Oh whoa, I'm done.
And I'm sorry that you don't like your life
I fought for my own victories and for the beauty in my life
My joy, my joy, my joy takes nothing from you
no, my joy, my joy takes nothing from you
[guitar solo]
Well, you criticize my numbers, you hammer out the rules
wait for me to fuck up, and find yourself some proof
and I'm done
Oh whoa, I'm done.
You just soak in the hatred of a sorry line
yeah, you hide behind decorum and a fake smile,
and I'm done
Oh whoa, I'm done
And you can drag me out before a judge in authority
if that's what you have to do to feel like you can punish me
but I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't keep the peace anymore
With your doubts, with your doubts, in my door
Well I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't keep the peace anymore
With your dogs, with your dogs, at my door"
"If he brings you happiness
Then I wish you all the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Si te quire de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa' los dos
Pero si te hare llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas
I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried
And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls"
"Oh the first time that we ever danced together
You kissed me and I froze right where I stood
It felt just like that night could go on forever
That's the very moment my heart thought you would
Always be, always be mine
Always be, always be mine
Remember when we drove all night down to Daytona
I don't even think we ever saw the beach
We spent half our weeks vacation in a hotel room
And that might not be your favorite memory
But it will always be, always be mine
Always be, always be mine
Oh I know we said we don't belong together
But if by chance you ever change your mind
And you need two arms still dying to hold you
It will always be, always be mine
I still keep your picture hanging in the hallway
And all the letters in the bottom of the drawer
I still believe for every one there's only one true love
And I realize that I'll never be yours
But you'll always be, always be mine
Always be, always be mine
Yes you'll always be, always be mine
Always be, always be mine"
"I drive all day at hauling freight until I get my fill
And after five I'm always found at Dottie's Bar and Grill
I talked with all the local crowd a couple hours more
Then head for home where she is always waiting at the door
When I got home this evening about a half past ten
And found she wasn't waiting so I let myself on in
I headed for the icebox to get myself a beer
And found that little note that said my baby wasn't there
There was a bathroom tissue paper letter hanging on the wall
She said I just can't take no more and you can have it all
I'm taking what good sense I've got and leaving you behind
And you can take this letter and wipe me from your mind
Yeah you can take this letter and wipe me from your mind"
"I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
You're a gentle man
And a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find these days
And you're a tender man
And you're man enough to show your love and tender ways
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I love those silly things you do
You make me feel once more like an innocent child of two
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day"
"Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee
My momma taught me how to pray
Before I reached the age of seven
When I'm down on my knees
That's when I'm closest to heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and a wife
Well you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes
To get me through, oh yeh!
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee
Oh yeh!
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man
Who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself
And you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man
From Galilee
Oh yeh!"
"If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song
Of a flower that's now dropped and dead,
Yet dearer to me, yes than all of its mates,
Though each holds aloft its proud head.
Twas given to me by a girl that I know,
Since we've met, faith I've known no repose.
She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star,
And I call her my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
They may sing of their rose, which by other names,
Would smell just as sweetly, they say.
But I know that my Rose would never consent
To have that sweet name taken away.
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
The bower where my true love grows,
And my one wish has been that some day I may win
The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower that grows.
You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that grows,
And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose."
"I was born in the south land
Twenty some odd years ago
I ran away for the first time
When I was three years old
I'm a free born man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track
Well I got this old guitar
Well I carry it in an old tote sack
Well I hawked it about a hundred times
but I always get it back
I'm a free born man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track
Well you may not like my appearance
An' you may not like my song
Well you may not like the way I talk
But you like the way I'm gone
I'm a free born man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway
Every foot of backroad
Every mile of railroad track"
"(Dolly Parton)
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Tempted and tried with each step we take
We stumble and slide and make our mistakes,
Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins,
Then we take off our horns and wear halos again
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint
Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born
Just tryin' to balance halos and horns
It's heaven or hell, halos or horns
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so
So we struggle through life in horns or halos
It's either horns or halos"
"I work down at Ashbury Hill
Minimum wage, but it pays the bills
Cleanin' floors and leadin' hymns on Sunday
Catherine Davis, room 3-0-3
Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee every day
She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me
She talks about the clothes on the line in summer air
Christmas morning and Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family, that I never had
Well sometimes I find myself wishin' I'd been there
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me
There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis, '71
Until she can see his face again
I'm gonna fill in the best I can
When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
'Fore your daddy gets home
She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me
She calls me Raymond
And that's alright by me"
"This is the boy that live in a house that love built
These are the arms that held the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
So walls are made of sunshine the sunshine of your smile
And all the bliss of that first kiss was mine for just a while
[ steel ]
This is the boy who destroyed the house that love built
My empty arms have lost the charms of the sweetest girl in town
These are the hands that made the plans for a house that love built
And this is the heart that got broke when the house got tumblin' down
The roof was made of moonlight with kisses warm and sweet
And all the beams were made of dreams that I laid at your feet
If you'll start all over and say that you're still mine
I'll build from love that's strong enough to stand the test of time"
"I've been around
a block or two
I've never seen nothin quite like you
You like to drink
smoke, tell dirty jokes
Your not the kinda girl
take home to your folks
But I'm so into you
and the things you do
I wouldn't change one thing
If you'd only take this ring
cause I'm so into you
I hope you say I do
Cause I'm so into you
I love your soft brown hair
big brown eyes
that beautiful smile
drives me wild
and no other could make me feel
the way you do
Cause I'm so into you
and the things you do
I wouldn't change one thing
If you'd only take this ring
cause I'm so into you
I hope you say I do
Cause I'm so into you
Cause I'm so into you"
"Fancy meeting you here
I guess I always knew there'd
Come a time we'd meet this way
It's good to see your face again
How long has it been
It seems like only yesterday.
You know I still remember
Time we spent together
Little things we'd do and say
The night you said goodbye
Stays here on my mind
As if it were only yesterday.
I feel the unrelenting march of time
And every day I fall another day behind
I want no other love, I wish on stars above
Not for tomorrow only yesterday.
I feel the unrelenting march of time
And every day I fall another day behind.
Our love builds on for me
It is my everything
But for you it's only yesterday
But for you it's only yesterday"

"Well way out west where the wild wind blows the eagle flies and the sage brush grows
Traditions are holding on you'll be glad to hear
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
Like that young cowboy from old Montana got boots and spurs and a black bandana
He rides the wild prairie rounding up the steers
Just like his Daddy he's a son of The Pioneers
From Texas clear up the Idaho from the mountains to the plains
They got the blood of Crockett and Geronimo flowing through their veins
Now the wild old west is changing some but traditions persevere
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers
[ piano - fiddle ]
There's a gal down in Texas with a great big hat
She likes roping and dancing and things like that
And if you need a hand at your branding she'll volunteer
She's a wild prairie flower and a daughter of the Pioneers
He's got braids and hat with an eagle feather
He rides with broncs there ain't none better
And his great grandaddy was a chief on the wild frontier
And he's a proud son of the original Pioneers
Well from Texas clear up the Idaho...
They're being kept alive by the Sons of The Pioneers

"If I never get to heaven it will be for loving you
It's so easy for a heart in love to sin
Oh I want to go to heaven please believe me dear it's true
But I'm afraid the angels might let me in
Cause I'd steal and I'd lied to keep you by my side
And I even beg or steal if you wanted me to
Right or wrong I'll always love you till the world comes to an end
So if I never get to heaven I'll blame you
(Cause I'd steal and I'd lied to keep you by my side)
And I even beg or steal if you wanted me to...

"Don't you ever let this world push you around
Use your head and keep your feet firmly on the ground
And if you get knocked down
Get back up and try again
And don't you ever lose that sparkle in your eyes
Don't bottle up your passion like a jar fireflies
If you ever lose sight of your light
And you feel like givin' in
Don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
Don't buy a thing unless you can pay in cash
Go ahead and throw those credit cards in the trash
Love is a virtue, honesty is the key
Say your prayers, brush your teeth
Don't you watch too much TV
If you're down in the count one strike away
Choke up and crowd the plate, put the ball in play
Keep your nose down when you win
Keep your head up when you lose
And you're gonna lose
But don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
And there will come a day
When I will fly away, so make me smile
While we're apart
You gotta sing from you soul and play with all of your heart
There's a good chance your heart will break in two
Trust that God has someone special planned for you
Did you know I was down on love and luck
When he sent your mom to me?
Someday you'll have babies of your own
So cherish every moment
You're gonna blink and they'll be grown
The greatest honor that I've ever had
Is having you call me your dad
Boys, don't you forget your faith in God above
Don't you forget your mom and daddy's love
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog
When you fear, when you fail
When you feel you're gonna fall
Follow your heart and always believe in the underdog"
"There are songs that bring back memories
That's what good songs do
I remember this one playing
On the night that I met you
You sang it to me in the moonlight
No voice ever sounded that way
Yes the melody that we danced to
Haunts me to this day
Chorus:
I hear it in the street, I hear it in the car
It's on every button that I've pushed so far
I can't turn it off, I can't walk away
The next time I hear that song play
I'm gonna do what I should've done long ago
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio
It takes a lot to make me angry
I've never been a violent man
But I'm gonna start carrying a hammer
And keeping it close at hand
If silence really is golden
I don't need and on/off switch
No this ball peen hammer I'm a holdin'
Is about to make me rich
Chorus:
I hear it in the street, I hear it in the car
It's on every button that I've pushed so far
I can't turn it off, I can't walk away
The next time I hear that song play
I'm gonna do what I should've done long ago
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio
Sparks are gonna fly out
The music's gonna die out
The DJ's gonna cry out loud
Chorus:
I hear it in the street, I hear it in the car
It's on every button that I've pushed so far
I can't turn it off, I can't walk away
The next time I hear that song play
I'm gonna do what I should've done long ago
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio
Yes, I'm gonna break the radio
Whoa, I'm gonna break the radio"

I made her call up two more cunts, and friend that at no jive.
She don't give me no shit about being no big time lover.
Some movie star with a jag.
Cause you ain't shit...
If you can't get Linda Lovelace to gag.
And don't talk about being no full-time lover, cause mister, that's my bag.
I'm the only motherfucker in the damn world that can make Linda Lovelace gag.

"I've got something to say, boys
I've got something to say
Just as soon as I can find a way, boys
I've got something to say
I was standing in a ally one dark lonely night
There were three or four shotguns wanting to fight
Now me and the devil we were seeing the light
Looking for someplace to run
And I said I've got something to say boys
I've got something to say
Just as soon as I can find a way boys
I've got something to say
I caught with a couple of friends
I was just slipping out, they was just slipping in
I was too hurt to laugh, I was to sick to grin
Watching the woman I love
The cop at the gate swore I was insane
'Cause me and my pistol tried boarding a plane
Now we were both loaded and its hard to explain
How wed ever gotten that far
I was the first one to get the last laugh
When they said my son was to old for the draft
That's when the government gave me the shaft
Drafted my daughter instead"
"Ain't but a half a mile between the city limit signs
Population nine hundred 'n' nine
A lotta front porch swingin', down home livin'
Friday night hell raisin', Sunday morning repentance
We got our gossip goin' on down at Betty's Beauty Shop
They're sellin' 90 proof corn juice out back at the co-op
Judge Taylor likes to fight when his potbelly's full of beer
Theres always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
We got kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales being told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin goin' wrong around here
Old men bettin' on the weather on the courthouse stairs
Luther wackin' off weeds in his underwear
They go moon skinny-dippin' this time of year
Theres always somethin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here
Other than kids burnin' rubber 'round the old town square
Tall tales bein' told in Harry's barber chair
Life moves slow
There's always somethin' goin' on
But there ain't nothin' goin' wrong around here"
"In a pickup truck we bought in 1962
And paid each month till it belonged to me and you
The cardboard boxes in the back hold everything we own
Things we've saved for sixteen years to start a brand new home
We're holding sixteen years of love in cardboard boxes
Sixteen years of laughter sweat and tears
We've stacked the back with happiness sadness love and cheer
Things we've saved together sixteen years
We sold our little dreamhouse on a small six acre farm
And said goodbye to friends we'll miss and fields of golden corn
In our search for city life where pay is big and jobs are fine
Sixteen years of love and tears following behind
We're holding sixteen years of love..."
"SILVER THREADS AND GOLDEN NEEDLES
WITH THE POZO SECO SINGERS
WRITERS JACK RHODES, DICK REYNOLDS
I don't want your lonely mansion With a tear in every room All I want's the love you promised Beneath the haloed moon But you think I should be happy With your money and your name And hide myself in sorrow While you play your cheatin' game Silver threads and golden needles Cannot mend this heart of mine And I dare not drown my sorrow In the warm glow of your wine But you think I should be happy With your money and your name And hide myself in sorrow While you play your cheatin' game Silver threads and golden needles Cannot mend this heart of mine And I dare not drown my sorrow In the warm glow of your wine You can't buy my love with money For I never was that kind Silver threads and golden needles Can not mend this heart of mine Silver threads and golden needles Can not mend this heart of mine"
"I wish I was a millionaire
I'd play rock music and grow long hair
I tell you boys I'd buy a new Rolls Royce.
Pretty women'd come to me I'd give 'em all the third degree
I'd give 'em Satin Sheets to keep 'em off the streets.
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya
Praise the Lord and pass the tambourine
Great Jehova
You'll come over
As soon as you see me boogie-woogie
Cross the silver screen.
I can hang 'em high or hang 'em low
I'd put 'em in the ceilings wherever I'd go
And swing all night from the rafter lights.
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya
I wish you was a millionaire
Hallelujah
Let me sook it to ya"
"I'm just a plain ol' country kid and I like to do what's right
Just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes they got resistance but no matter how I tried
Then a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I'll say honey, you better not do that and she'll say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that
When I was in a country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satisfied
And I'd say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Now when I was a little older I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun I was a thinkin' bout romance
But the dim lights just lured upon and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long I'm human you see
And I'd say baby you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'd say cause you just better not do that
Well that's the way my life has been ain't it a cryin' shame
How much longer can I last if I keep playin' the game
Sometimes I don't know who I am do they know what they're doin'
I'm afraid in years to come that girls will be my ruin
And I'll say honey you better not do that and she'd say why
And I'll say cause you just better not do that and she'd say why George
And I'll say ah well um it's alright if you do that"
"I see the town where we were born I see the place we were raised
I see all the things you wanted that I never gave
I see sadness I see sorrow I see pain on your face
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
I can see now where we quarreled I can see now I was wrong
I can see where you might weaken and I wasn't strong
I see mem'ries of a love gone bad that time cannot erase
But I just can't see a stranger in my place
No one seems to know you quite like I do no one knows the things that make you cry
And looking back it seems I never showed you and now I lay alone and wonder why
I can see now where you might grow tired of dreams that don't come true
I can see where I have fallen short of the things I promised you
I can see now through my tear filled eyes no love on your face
But I still can't see a stranger in my place"
"You're up on your high heels, you're up on the bar
You're up on a level, up there with the shooting stars
Dancing around the drinks with honkey tonk angel wings
Making the party sing, yeah, that's my baby
It ain't even midnight yet, there's a whole lot of neon left
Looks like we're gonna get all kinds of crazy
We'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me up
You're up on the tailgate, you're up on a three beer buzz
You're up like the music pumping out of the cab of my truck
Up where the city lights came can't but get, get outshines
By the blue jeans and brown eyes I pull in closer
Yeah, this night's far from over with
Still up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me
Up on a high like I'm walking on clouds
Baby, tonight I don't wanna come down"
"If I still had the heart to love
The way I used to love you
I might still have some trace
Of my identity
If I still had just half a mind
I'd call you up and ask you
Where you left the man
I used to be
'Cause I miss me
I'm not the same
Just someone else
Using my name
I wish you
Would come back soon
'Cause I miss me
I've been all up and down the roads
That lead to my old memories
But I can't find the one
With all my hopes and dreams
And I've been lookin' in my eyes
For something I still recognize
But some stranger's stare
Is all that I see
I miss me
I'm not the same
Just someone else
Using my name
I wish you
Would come back soon
'Cause I miss me
You've made me
A better man
That I've ever thought I'd be
And now that you're gone
I can't move on
'Cause I miss me
I'm not the same
A little someone else
Using my name
I wish you'd come back soon
'Cause I miss me
I miss me"
"Before the sun came up
He sipped that coffee black
Slid on his muddy boots
Pulled down his feed store cap
He taught me how to grease the points
On that massey 2-4-0
But I was way too busy
Didn't really care to go
So he worked the fields alone
But what I didn't know
Up on that tractor
Things might be faster in the world
But big wheels rollin' slow
Help you see what's important
What really does matter
Up on that tractor
Just like the dirt is black
So do the years fly by
He stayed home with mom
I travelled far and wide
And like a good man does
He listened when I called
Told him 'bout my crazy life
And all the things I saw
But when it was time to go
He wanted me to know
Up on that tractor
Things might be faster in the world
But big wheels rollin' slow
Help you see what's important
What really does matter
Up on that tractor
It tore my world apart
When god took him away
Didn't get to say goodbye
And I miss him everyday
When all the fields grew up
This is right back where I came"
"Wish there was something in my heart to give you
But I felt around and nothing's left
I'm trying to dig deeper but I've hit the bottom
I've gotta let go and save myself
But if I were stronger
I'd hold on longer
I'd be your savior and I'd stay
I'd love you better right through the anger
I'd hold on longer If I was stronger
I'm tired of talking because you just ain't hearing
You turn away each time I speak
Now my soul is weary threadbare and broken
And arms that were open feel so weak
But if I were stronger
I'd hold on longer
I'd be your savior and I'd stay
I'd love you better right through the anger
I'd hold on longer If I was stronger
You're about to fall and when I let go
You're gonna know who's holding on
And giving everything and every part of me
It hates to see you go
But baby then you'll be falling just the same
Because that's what's best for me
But if I were stronger
I'd hold on longer
I'd be your savior and I'd stay
I'd love you better right through the anger
I'd hold on longer If I was stronger"
"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
All your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white"
"I'LL HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
(Vic McAlpin - Eddy Arnold - Howard Horton)
'47 Forster Music
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
I'll think of you each day and I'll dream the night away
Until you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
So darling please wait for me
The stars up in the sky know the reason why...
Oh darling please wait for me"
"We're holding on with nothin' left to hold on to
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times that we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go on bluffin' with really nothing left to hold on to
Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other
That's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to
We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show
For all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long how hard we've tried
Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other
That's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to"
"(Loving you and making believe)
Making believe that you still love me it's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream still I'll never own you making believe is all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime loving you and making believe
[ piano ]
Making believe that I never lost you but my happy hours I'll find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true making believe what else can I do
Can't hold you close..."
"mel bay in your manual you taught us how to hold a pick

"lyrics by Corb Lund, music by Stan Rogers / Corb Lund
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna good steed under me like my forefathers before
Courageous at first we took their worst, our positions we held stout
We clung to belief and we hung on the speech from our trusted leaders mouths
Overwhelming odds and a hopeless cause and our cities overrun
There were them that said we was badly led and God were we outgunned
I lost count of the worthy mounts that from under me were cut
My favourite mare with her head in the air took the cannons in her gut
In the first two weeks on that bloody creek my brother lost his arm
Was only sixty days till all we prayed was get us home unharmed
O for the day that we signed our names and the well that we were wished
The mens congrats and the pats on the backs and the ladies that we kissed
The band that played and the grande parade and the patriotic shouts
All faded fast, didn't even last till the uniforms wore out
And there were none to replace nor to help us face the winters cold and bleak
That chilled to the bone the pneumonia prone and froze our bootless feet
Then the typhoid hit with its fevered fits, TB and dysentery
That proved in the end to have killed more men than the vilest enemy
We were finally forced to feed on horse and carcass we could scrounge
When the wagons stopped and wed burnt their crops to charred and barren ground
With morale in doubt and our pride run out no honour did I see
All I seen were a thousand dreams piled dead in front of me
I wanna be in the cavalry if the send me off to war
I wanna be in the cavalry but I wont ride home no more"
"Things down at my house just ain't going right I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I'm sick and tired of coming home and that gal ain't in sight
I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I wonder what she does all day I wonder where she goes
When I get home she's always gone dressed in her best clothes
I'm going out and live it up chase every girl in sight I'm gonna tie one on tonight
[ piano ]
My baby she's out on the town and I think just for spite
And I'm gonna tie one on tonight
She thinks she's gonna worry me but I'll show her all right
I'm gonna tie one on tonight
I'm gonna dance with all the girls and have myself as free
When I get home and find her there crying over me
When I come in at three a.m. there'll prob'ly be a fight
But I'm gonna tie one on tonight yes I'm gonna tie one on tonight"
"If you love somebody enough
You'll follow wherever they go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
If you love somebody enough
You'll go where your heart wants to go
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me cause you are my friend
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in
And if you tell me she's not here
You can follow the trail of my tears
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
She'd get mad and she used to say
She'd come back to Memphis someday
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I haven't eaten a bite
Or slept for three days and nights
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so
I'll never rest til I find out why she had to go
So thank you for your precious time
Forgive me if I start to cry
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis
That's how I got to Memphis"
"You placed gold on my finger
You brought love like I've never known
You gave life to our children
And to me a reason to go on
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend
When I need hope and inspiration
You're always strong when I'm tired and weak
I could search this whole world over
You'd still be everything that I need
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend
You're my bread when I'm hungry
You're my shelter from troubled winds
You're my anchor in life's ocean
But most of all you're my best friend"
"If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If someone else is on your mind don't let it show
For I'd rather have your lie I could never stand goodbye
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If you find somebody new don't let me know
If your love for me is through don't let it show
If I ask you please don't say darlin' turn and walk away
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know
If your love for me is gone don't let me know
If someone else is in your dreams don't let it show
Close your eyes so I won't see for I don't want sympathy
If you fall out of love with me don't let me know"
"I can have a heart of stone
Stand my ground and walk alone
Be strong when everything falls down around me
I can keep my self-control
Guard the secrets of my soul
Solid as a rock
Until you found me
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
You roll me like a piece of clay
All my amibition melts away
Everytime my baby I'm around you
Shakin' when you hold me close
I'm unprotected and exposed
I don't know just what it is that you do
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
All my walls com tumblin' down
They just crumble to your touch
Baby you move me
You shake me
You take me in your arms and make me
want to give you every little piece my heart
Baby you rock me
You roll me
There's something in the way you hold me yeah
Oh I just fall apart
Baby you break me
Baby you break me
Ohh ohh
I just fall apart
Baby you break me"
"It's twilight and the streets
Light are coming on
I'm in a stream of cars
On this Boulevard, headed home
I can hardly wait
You can make what went wrong today
Seam right
Bring on the night
It's been a long hard day
So bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night
From nine to five it's the same ole grind
All week long
And the only thing
That keeps sane, is coming home
When the sun goes down
You know how to set things right
Lets put the day behind us
And bring on the night
Bring on the night
And pull down the shades
Lock the world out side
And throw the key away
Turn on the feelings
And turn out the lights
Lets call it a day
And bring on the night"
"How's the view from the top of the world I wonder are you still my girl
From so far above me can you hear my plea wait for me at the top of the world
I just thought you might like to know that someone down here below
Is hopefully climbing the ladder of fortune
Don't step on my fingers don't make me let go
From your view at the top of the world do you remember you're still my girl
Or have you forgotten your promise to me that we'd meet at the top of the world"
"My father's name was Hannibal, Mama was Hanna-Mariah.
Everything we owned got all burned up in the great depression fire
Strip mines and one crop farming drained the green earth dry.
We lost it all till only love was left, and that was the one thing money can't buy.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
Well, the crops won't grow,
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
Well, they said in California, there's work of every kind.
The only job that I got out there was waiting on a welfare line.
Once I had a dollar, once I had a dream.
Now all the work is being done by a big ole machine.
We're all Dust Bowl Children
Singin' the dust bowl song
And the crops won't grow,
And the dust just blows
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone.
When the green fields are gone.
When the green grass growing fields are gone."
"Well she gave him the last chance
For the hundreth time again
And he hears the words she said
But he can't let the truth sink in
It won't sink in
You think he woulda learned by now
No one ever showed him how
We fly, we fall, we run we crawl
We laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some, we lose some
We lonesome
She looks out her window
At the thousand souls below
How easy it would be
To close her eyes and
Just let go just let go
You think we woulda learned by now
It's not like no one showed us how
We fly, we fall, we run
We crawl, we laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some
We lose some we lonesome
We fly, we fall, we run
We crawl, we laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some, we lose some
We lonesome
We fly
(lonesome)
We fly
(lonesome)"
"I left home a long long time ago
In a tin can for the road
With a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the night time
Making tracks with no time for looking back
To the place where I belong
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
When you're sad, you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear
And set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true
Wherever I might be
Time keeps burning, the whels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long
Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echoes in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last forever by your side
How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Time keeps burning, the wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long"
"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend"
"American me, so wild and so free
Crossing the borders did nothing to me
The milk and the honey were power and greed
That's how it goes, American me
And the [?] sun rising slow in the morning
Makes river lost low like the gold and a tanned hand is fast
The children are waiting as Clement, they're washing their bodies
And pitchers of wine in the bed by the old, the old ?
Long years ago I was there with a Mexican lady
A beautiful body, so graceful and ? sang
A mission bells ranging, we both gave our hearts to each other
Then we made love in the bed of the old ?
American me, so wild and so free
Crossing the borders did nothing to me
The milk and the honey were power and greed
That's how it goes, American me"
"Some roads that you take
Some bonds we'll choose to break
I swore I'd no long be the pallbearer
But I carried you to bed
So you could rest your head
You were taking off a load, heavy drinking
The world it carries on
Your memories and song
And your pictures on my wall, are not forgotten
There was hymns that came from mouths
That turned crosses upside down
But it came through their teeth with great ease
And all are bobbing heads in sync
And all have got a lot on their minds to think about
But you carry on in pictures and in song
And the unmade bed you slept in
Where I laid you down to rest one last time
Goodbye, dear friend, Goodbye, dear friend
Some stories break your heart
And some with such applaud
Buried deep inside, where it's okay to cry
Some boys won't shed a tear
Oh, but a tale like this here...
It can break me down and get me where it hurts the most
And all are bobbing heads in sync
And all have got a lot on their minds to think about
But you carry on in pictures and in song
And the unmade bed you slept in
Where I laid you down to rest one last time
Goodbye, dear friend, Goodbye, dear friend"
"I come from a place
Where every name
And every place
Seem so familiar
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
Much like you and I
And every case that's made
There has to be a traitor
It's me this time
And I'm trading fun for right
Will I regret the notion later?
Geraldine's the name that comes to mind
When I go back to reminiscing
Abilene's a woman for my childhood
I spent the evenings kissing
I'm a fool for treating her alive
And loving something cold and rocky
The homophobic gentlemen
They'll barricade but their efforts couldn't stop me
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
In came this progress
In her black dress
Look at the mess
She is a killer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"Well if I had a dollar for every time you let me down,
Stood me up, gave me the run around I'd still spend it all on you
We used to get so dressed up just to get so messed up
Chilling in the back of the club all night like we're all alone
But that girls gone
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
you've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby
Who ya been with is there something to it?
are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
just asking
Well tell me what you thinking just tell me anything at all
say a word or say it all
I gotta hear it straight from you
We used to get so caught up
getting spent and making love
the kind of love where we both end up on the bedroom floor
but it ain't no more
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
you've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby
Who ya been with is there something to it?
are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
just asking
What you been doing?
And who ya been with?
Is there something to it?
Are you just friends with him?
I ain't mad at ya
I'm just asking
oohh
So give it me straight babe, I can take it
If there's another guy just tell me why
you've been runnin' late babe every single day, every single night
Give it to me straight baby

"(Daddy what if the sun stop shinin' what would happen then)
If the sun stopped shinin' you'd be so surprised
You'd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light to the skies
And the sun would start shinin' again
(Daddy what if the wind stopped blowin' what would happen then)
If the wind stopped blowin' then the land would be dry
And your boat wouldn't sail son and your kite wouldn't fly
And the grass would see your troubles and she'd tell the wind
And the wind would start blowin' again
(But daddy what if the grass stopped growin' what would happen then)
If the grass stopped growin' why you'd probably cry
And the ground would be watered by the tears from your eyes
And like your love for me the grass would grow so high
Yes the grass would start growin' again
(But daddy what if I stopped lovin' you what would happen then)
If you stopped lovin' me then the grass would stop growin'
The sun would stop shinin' and the wind would stop blowin'
So you see if you wanna keep this old world a goin'
You better start lovin' me again again you better start lovin' me again
You hear me Bobby you better start lovin' me again
You love me Bobby you better start lovin' me again"
"Guys are playing pool, long necks in a bucket
Bragging about their luck with the ladies in bed
Laughing when they ask him for all the dirty details
He don't say nothing, just starts shaking his head
[Chorus]
Spoken like a man devoted to a woman
Not just any woman, but the love of his life
Spoken like a man crazy about the feeling
He gets every evening when they turn out the light
Cue behind the eight, he's staring down the table
There's a cutie across the room trying to catch his eye
She walks across the bar with her number on a napkin
He gives it to a buddy with a wink and a smile
[Chorus]
He pays his tab, pulls his keys out of his pocket
The boys say, 'where you going? Just one more game
Give us one good reason why you can't hang.'
Turns at the door and just holds up his ring
[Chorus]
Spoken like a man, spoken like a man
Spoken like a man"
"We'll walk the road of life together day by day
And I will love you every step of the way
The road may wind beneath the sky of blue or gray
But I will love you every step of the way
So only love me and love me only
And we will never walk with loneliness
For just as sure as every April turns to May
So will I love you every step of the way
I'll love you only every step of the way"
"I been wired since I can't remember when
You seen me out most every night with a dissipated grin
All my life I been been ribald, loose and loud now I think I'm finally wearin' down
I may rock and I may roll I may sleep out in the cold
I can still stay up six days in a row
But I know the things I do don't compare with the things I did
If you think I'm crazy now should've seen me when I was a kid
I been wild I been wasted stoned and stooped
Stayed out nights and started fights and wore out two bar stools
All these years it's been bedrooms bars and beers
But now the end is finally drawin' near
I may rock and and may roll"
"Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Who's gonna shoe, your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your little hands
Who's gonna kiss, your ruby red lips
Who-oo-oo-oo
Papa's gonna shoe, your pretty little feet
Mama's gonna glove, your little hands
And I'm gonna kiss, your ruby red lips
Who-oo-oo-oo
Mmm,mmmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Who's gonna shoe, your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your little hands
Who's gonna kiss, your ruby red lips
Who-oo-oo-oo
Papa's gonna shoe, your pretty little feet
Mama's gonna glove, your little hands
And I'm gonna kiss, your ruby red lips
Who-oo-oo-oo
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm
Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm"

Sunday Sunday Sunday morning a new week starts and the old one ends
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning
Start the day out right with your family and your friends
[ Nat ]
Now I recall my younger years when I was just a pup
I could tell what day it was the moment I got up
On every Sunday morning and always without fail
My mom would have my Sunday suit out hanging on the nail
[ Both ]
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
[ Connie ]
Now mom and dad and sis and I put on our Sunday clothes
And hand in hand we'd all walk down that long and dusty road
Then order book and up the hill through the mountain side
And all our friends and neighbors they were marching in a line
[ Both ]
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
Now Pastor Brown was waiting there to teach us Sunday school
We'd open up the good book and we'd learn the golden rule
And fore we'd even know it'd wash away our sins
Oh Lord it's grand to see how warm our Sunday morn begins
On Sunday Sunday Sunday morning...
Start the day out right with your family and your friends"
"I'm waiting tonight, for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I used to think your love would always save me
And that you'd always stay right by my side
But I can see a change comin' over you
And the tears I cry just can't hide
No, I'm waiting tonight for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
I can't pretend that love is just a pastime
And that you never meant a thing to me
So darlin, please don't leave me all alone,
Surrounded by your memory
I'm waiting tonight, for you to tell me,
Do you still love me and will you remain?
My heart is breakin' with each passing hour
Please don't let me love you in vain
So please don't let me love??? you in vain"
(Instrumental)
"Parked down on lover's leap
Steaming up his old heap
Two lovers stare up at the stars
Somewhere in the lights below
Two houses all aglow
Parents wondering where on earth they are
'Cause their folks have tried to tell them
This is way too serious
And while their mommas are waiting up they're
Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'
A few years and some wedding vows
A quarter-acre and a little white house
More than they can well afford
And those easy payments are getting tough
All the overtime ain't enough
Still they couldn't ask for more
'Cause that old hill that they've been climbin'
Might be gettin' steep
Oh, but they don't seem to mind it they keep
Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'"
"You said you love me and me alone and that you'd always be mine my own
But someone new came and you did not kept to remember so you forgot
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly you broke the vow that you made to me
With all my heart I believed in you but careless darlin' you were untrue
[ steel ]
Your last goodbye will forever ring within my ear and full heartaches bring
I kept my promise I kept my vow but you kept nothing it's so plain now
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly...
[ guitar ]
Now if tomorrow those bygone years those older mem'ries should bring you tears
Think of our parting that luckless day you carelessly threw my love away
Oh careless darlin' how carelessly..."
"When I was just a little boy and life was bright and new
Askin' foolish questions was all I could find to do
One day I asked my grandpa why he moved around so slow
He said listen son I'll tell you if you really wanna know
It's the age that makes the difference and the difference you can see
I'm runnin' out of what the doctors call vitality
I'm just like a dried up apple that keeps hangin' through a tree
It's the age that makes the difference and the difference tells on me
[ steel ]
So when I started courtin' I was bashful and shy
It tore me all to pieces when a girl winked her eye
But when I started catchin' on I didn't learn to slow
Pretty soon they said I was a reckled Romeo
It's the age that makes the difference and the difference put me wise
That the time was right for lovin' and the limit was the skies
Pretty soon I found out what it took to not come cold
It was the age that made the difference and the difference made me bold
[ guitar ]
Not long ago I was a man that really got around
But here I've laid I've noticed that I started slowin' down
I find that ain't no trouble now to stay at home at night
I'm mild and mellowed now but I will soon be over right
It's the age that makes the difference and the difference makes me know
That my high speed days are over and I'll have to take it slow
I ain't really feeling older but I just don't feel the same
It's the age that makes the difference father time can make a change"
"Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a, Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you."
"*Verse 1*
In a small cafe off 22, I asked a trucker what I should do
I said I need a place where I can settle down
He looked at me with a tired grin, said if I could do it all over again I'd be headin' south without looking back
*Chorus*
Cause I've been on the road from coast to coast and there's one place I love the most
If you ask me for all its worth
There ain't nothin' done on earth as it is in Texas
*Verse 2*
I moved to Dallas for 5 years straight til I was back on that interstate
Thought I was missing something that I had to find
What I found was reality there's only one place I was meant to be
And under the Texas sun I was driving home
*Chorus*
I've been on the road from coast to coast and there's one place I love the most
If you ask me for all its worth
There ain't nothin' done on earth as it is in Texas
*Bridge*
I guess I've lost that restless side of me
Cause Lord knows I'll never leave
*Chorus*
I've been on the road from coast to coast and there's one place I love the most
If you ask me for all its worth
There ain't nothin' done on earth as it is in Texas
As it is in Texas
As it is in Texas"
"If I can stay away long enough maybe I'll forget you
If I can stay away long enough I'll lose my love for you
If I could get you out of my mind another love I'll try to find
And live my life of happiness till the end
If I can stay away long enough maybe you'll forget me
I can stay away long enough if you'll just let me be
Cause I know our love affair could never last
So I'll just stay away and let it all be in the past
Cause I know our love affair..."
"Hey baby there's two sides to every story
I've heard them one too many times
Just stop callin' I'm not falling anymore
I've had enough of all your charms
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
You can cry and cry and I won't listen
I can't hear you anymore
You can lie your lies and I won't miss 'em
Hey just walk out that door
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
Hey baby love may come and love may go
But now it's gone for good
Just stop tryin' I'm not buyin' anymore
I've taken all I could
Once and for all that's enough for a life time
Love's lost at long last it's over
Close the door and walk away
On the leavin' side
Oh it's over close the door
And walk away on the leavin' side
Na na na na..."
"When I'm cryin' just cryin' over what we've become
That's not but cry though I look there on the demage that we've done
We can start here not parted for there's hope for me and you
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take too
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
[ steel ]
It's not rain it's just pain runnin' down my face
I feel certain that's a hurtin' won't leave any trace
We'll erase it just replace it with a love we once knew
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
If we put our heads..."
"Why must you always try
To make me over, take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a standing for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go
You're trying to reshape me"
"Please break my heart
Say it's forever
Then I'll remember
How you said forever to me
Please break my heart
I'll be piece it together
I'd rather be shattered
Than to know forever
Without you
Love is all that matters
And it mattered none to you
Love is all that mattered
And you left me
Crying, sighing and blue
Please break my heart
Kiss me like never,
One kiss to remember
The rest of my life
To forget about you
All the broken hearts together,
Do they matter none to you?
I was hoping mine would matter
And you left me
Crying, sighing and blue
Please break my heart
Do it forever
Oh, please break my heart"
"There is grime on my face
There is crust in my eye
There is no one in this place
But no one said goodbye
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
There is hate in my heart
This is how my day starts
There is blood in my hands
From the murder of a man
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
And where is my queen
She's as gone as can be
She was a fine lookin' lady
And she liked to go down on me
And I liked to go down on her too
In India there's the Taj
On good times there was Rog
And here look and see, all there is is me
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
This is how I start
Another day in my kingdom
There are good times to be had
Only insanes really bad
The Lord and I agree
It's not too off to be what we are
As long as were royalty
You fuck and what's to do
(You fuck)
It's not your kingdom too"
"When I think about you leaving and being here alone
It's not the love we knew that hurts me but the love we could have known
I'm not sorry that I held you I just wish that I still could
Oh it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good
I don't regret one moment that we had together
What's killing me is knowing we could've had forever
I just wish we loved each other the way I know we could
Oh it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good
I don't want to lose the mem'ries of all the nights we shared
And I never found a new love that ever could compare
I just wish we hadn't left things standing where they stood
Girl it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good
I don't regret one moment
Oh it's not that it was so bad it just could've been so good"
"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying amber
That September in the rain
To every word of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain
To every word of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it is still September
That September in the rain
That September that brought the pain
That September in the rain"
"Where have you gone my little boy little boy where have you gone my sonny my own
Turn around you're two turn around then you're four
Turn around you're a young man going out the door
Where have you gone my little girl little girl
Pigtails and petticoats where have you gone
Turn around you're tiny turn around then you're grown
Turn around you're a young wife with babes of your own
Where have they gone our little ones little ones
Where have they gone our children our own
Turn around and they're young turn around and they're old
Turn around and they've gone and we've no one to hold
Turn around and they're young"
"Youre loves not burning with that same old glow
Youre tryin to win what you already won
You love her and you want to let her know
Well buddy this is my opinion
(Chorus)
Sweep her off her feet with a slow slow dance
Hold her like shes holding on to new romance
If you want a love what you can be sure
Take her out and treat her like shes not yours
She wants to feel like its the first time
You gotta shower her with chivalry
Shes full of fantasy from nursery rhymes
I know what I would do if it were me
Repeat Chorus
Soon, youll be the lover in her life
Lyin in her arms, dancing in her eyes
Repeat Chorus 2x"
"I just got your letter dearest sweetheart
And darlin', I miss you oh, so much
Your letter has cheered me, but I'm lonesome
Lonesome just to feel your lovin' touch
(Chorus)
Letters have no arms, dear to hold me
Kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter
I want to be with you dear, when told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand
Or none of your sweet lovin' charms
I get so lonesome for you, darlin'
And you know that letters have no arms
[Chorus:]"
"All the way from Memphis, babe
In search of something new
You tell me now
That Memphis, girl
Don't hold a thing for you
Hypnotized by gypsy lies
Like a moth drawn to the flame
In the crowd
You're just a faceless face
Another nameless name
Living on the handouts
Of the Jesus of your own choosing
The Christ you knew
In Memphis, girl
Could not win for losin'
Love beeds for your rosary
And your drugs to see you through
You're telling me
At seventeen
You know more that I do
Say farewell to L.A
And your little coat of blue
'Cause meanwhile
Back in Memphis, girl
Our mama prays for you
All the way from Memphis, babe
In search of something new
You tell me now
At seventeen
You know more than I do"
"As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home's scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold"
"Friends, my name is Ferlin Husky.
I'd like to tell you 'bout a man that let alcohol
destroy everything that God gave him
I saw an accident one day that would chill the heart of any man
It would teach them not to drink a drop
While the steering wheel's in their hand
This awful accident occurred on the 20th day of May
And caused two little children to be sleepin' beneath the clay
These two little kids walked side by side along the state highway
Their poor old mother, she had died
And their daddy had ran away
As these two little children walked arm in arm
How sad their hearts did feel
When around the curb came a speeding car
With a drunk man at the wheel
The drunk man saw the little kids
And he hollered a drunked sound
""Get out of the road you little fools""
And the car, it brought them down
The bumper struck the little girl, takin' her life away
While the little boy, in a puddle of blood
In the ditch, lyin' there did lay
The drunk man staggered from his car
To see the damage that he had done
And then he let out a yell you could hear for miles
When he recognized his dyin' son
Such mournin' from a drunken man, I've never heard before
While kneeling down by his car he prayed to heavens door
Sayin', ""Oh God, please forgive me for this awful crime I've done""
And his attention then was called away
By the words of his dyin' son
He said, ""Daddy, why did you do this to us
How come you run us to the ground?
It was you and Mummy we were talkin' about,
When the car, it brought us down
And I was just tellin' little sister
That I knew we'd see you again someday
But, Daddy, why did it have to be this way
Why did it"
"I pushed him away
And carefully said
I'm just not that kind of girl
You might think I'm square
'Cause you've been around and you're wise
In the ways of the world
I know that making is taking for granted
It's all easy come, easy go
He pulled me close and whispered
Now darlin' there's something I want you to know
I still believe in Waltzes
And girls with old fashioned ways
I still believe in love songs
In the good, in the good ole days
I've always liked happy endings
Somebody's dream coming true
I still believe in Waltzes
And dancing the last one with you
He slipped into bed, I turned over and said
I'm worried you working so late
Is it just your job that keeps you away, Lord
I know the temptations are gray
I'm just a wife, I'm just a momma
It's not too exciting I know
He pulled me close and whispered those same words
He told me that night long ago
I still believe in Waltzes
And girls with old fashioned ways
I still believe in love songs
In the good, in the good ole days
I've always liked happy endings
Somebody's dream coming true
I still believe in Waltzes
And I'll dance the last one with you
We still believe in Waltzes"
"A past that's sprinkled with the blues
A few old dreams that I can't use
Who'll buy my mem'ries
Of things that used to be
There were the smiles before the tears
And with the smiles some better years
Who'll buy my mem'ries
Of things that used to be
When I remember how things were
My memories all leave with her
I'd like to start my life anew
But memories just make me blue
A cottage small just built for two
A garden wall with violets blue
Who'll buy my mem'ries
Of things that used to be
When I remember how things were..."
"There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guide us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't love"
"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down
Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down"
"I wanna get back
I wanna get square
I wanna get back on the hopes and dreams that I had
That the good lord above us can spare
Like that actor said
I don't wanna lose heart
I don't wanna get beat beat down by the big big world
I'll quit before I even start.
Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand new
I wanna hold hands
Yeah, and I wanna make love
And I wanna keep running all day, and all night
Even when my mind tell my body ""that's enough""
And I wanna stand up
Yeah, and I wanna stand tall
If I ever have a son, if I ever have a daughter
I don't wanna tell them that I didn't give my all
And I just wan my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
I just want my words to be true (I just want my words)
I want my soul to feel brand, brand new
Like a fresh coat of paint
We could make it anything but blue
Anything but blue
Now, when your dreams start saying
""I can't come true, you'd be better off without me""
Don't let them go
Don't let them go
I don't wanna go broke
Not from one bad deal
I don't wanna be up all night crying in my hands for a girl
That isn't even real
Lord, I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my words to be true (I just want my words to be true)
And I just want my heart you be true (just want my heart to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
And I just want my song to be true (Just want my song to be true)
And I just want my life to be true (I just want my life to be true)
I want my soul to feel brand new
I want my soul to feel brand new"
"Love is a shiny car
Love is a steel guitar
Love is a battle scar
Love is a morning song
Love is a twelve-bar blues
Love is your blue suede shoes
Love is a heart abused
Love is a mind confused
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Love is a mine of gold
Love is a man to hold
Love is a drowning soul
Love is it's own reward
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
And love is the pleasures I'm told
And for some love is still a band of gold
My love has no reason, has no rhyme
My love cross the double line
Oh, my love cross the double line
Oh, my love cross the double line"
"Hello love my old friend
Sure is good to see you again
I stood out, on the road
Just a watchin' the cars
A come and go
I felt empty, I felt bare
I really thought that I could not care
All the leaves are soaking wet
How succulent a little spring day gets
If you kiss me once
Out here in the rain
We'll go back and start all over again
So lift up every voice and sing
Sing to the tree tops
And everything
Say hello love
My old friend
Sure is nice
To see you again"
"Now I'm not talking tough, telling the truth ought to be enough
I've had my share on the darker side
Sitting and starring at a TV screen, racking my brain over all the things
If I'd just been there I could have tried
Things to do I can't help but think of more
I could fill my life without ever leaving home
I could see the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World
And even build a few more of my own (If I had a mind to)
Quit my job never mind the pay, maybe go figure out the CIA
Chase the paper and pass the bar, show Iaccoca how to build a car
Jump up and run a three minute mile, sit around and watch my baby smile
That's what I might do , if I had a mind to
No, I don't want to blow my horn, no telling how many souls I've worn
And what kind of shoes, when I had shoes
I'm still losing a bridge or two, but the troubled water's gonna run on through
You can't always win, but you can always lose
But I don't turn my head for things that pass me by
And I'm gonna have a look around
I could gather all the diamonds in the sky
Hold every one and never leave the ground, If I had a mind to
Fly through the eye of a hurricane, freeze my body like David Blaine
Be the first to find life on Mars, go up and sell a few candy bars
Climb a rainbow and kiss the sun, walk on the moon when the day is done
That's what I might do, If I had a mind to
Somewhere someone's doing everything I've said
I don't have to do anything, I could do it in my head
If I had mind to"
"it's my little foothills heaven on that northern rocky range
my favoriite place to be, and mister that ain't gonna change
and i pray to old chief mountain i'll be back again someday
just in time for you to hear me say
it's my little foothills heaven on that northern rocky range
and i hope that i'll get back again someday
i can see down to montana on a clear and sunny day
and i just may ride down there with my honey for the day
if there's trouble at the border i'll say 'hey well that's ok'
cuz i'd just as soon be back home anyway
to my little foothills heaven on that northern rocky range
and i hope that i'll get back again someday
yodel-ay
there's a bar-x on the rib of every critter you can see
and their coats are slick and shiny in the sun, just like you please
as they graze up toward valhalla you can almost hear them now
sayin 'it don't get much better for a cow'
than a little foothills heaven on that northern rocky range
and i hope that i'll be back again someday"
"(Dolly Parton)
I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end
Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear
'Cause you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You never cared about me
You only hurt and decieve
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
No you ain't worth the salt in my tears"
"Mercy (Chris Jonat)
All the children met
In day cares and nightclubs
Discussed finger paints and body rubs
They embraced it all
It hasn't happened yet
But pretty soon they will fall flat
Alcohol will take the edge off that
Ease the pain if not the fall
You gotta take off your hat, force a bow
Wipe that sweat right off your brow
Look her in the eye and try for mercy
And so the story grows
I got kind of wired and
I drove the snakes from Ireland
And then I broke for lunch
If you want a small nose
Give honesty a try
But if you gotta lie
You may as well lie a bunch
Hello, how are you? I like you plenty well
If you get bored here, there's always the hotel
We can order in, and turn off the ringer
And you can have your pick, the song or the singer"
"The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
Coming off a great love
There's plenty of pain to pass around
Like a tip jar in a dive bar
Full of broken hearts
It's a lonely crowd
The thing about a breakup
Sometimes you just gotta break down
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
Till they call the last call
And you're just drinking about the past
Like the bottom of the bottle
Knows how to get her back
The thing about a last kiss
You never know that it's the last
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'
Stuck on the left side
You're on the drunk part of drinking
The can't stop part of thinking
The wide awake part of sleeping, woah
You're on the broke part of breaking
The mistake part of making
You're on the cane part of shaking, woah
When the only thing you want is
The only thing that you can't have
When the part that you can't take is
Knowing you can't take it back
She's on the good side, goodbye
On the right sight of free
And you're on the wrong end of a long night
On the left side of leavin'
Yeah
On the left side of leavin'"
"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock."
"For thirty some odd years he faced
A grinder in the city,
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,
He bought his wife the finer things,
And sent his kids to college,
That always took what little bit
He tried to put aside,
But through it all he had one thing
That seemed to keep him going,
A dream that someday he could leave
This city life behind,
I watched his hair turn thin and gray,
But his dream never faded,
He told me all about it
At least a thousand times.
[Chorus]
He always wanted, a place out in the country,
Where the birds sing, in the morning,
And the grass is emerald green,
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,
And sit out in the evenin',
Where the air is, fresh and clean.
It took lots of overtime
To keep his wife up with the Jonses,
And more to get his son out of
His run-ins with the law,
The more it took the more he gave,
Never once complaining,
I don't know how he ever stood
The pressure of it all.
I never thought he'd make it,
But he finally left the city,
And now he's got that special little place
To call his own,
Today I took a ride out in the country
Just to see him,
It wasn't hard to find
Because his name was on the stone.
[Chorus: x2]"
"I ain't gonna marry in the fall I ain't gonna marry in the spring
Cause I'm in love with a pretty little girl who wears a diamond ring
And I'm just a country boy money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in morning sun gold in morning sun
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips of the prettiest girl in town
Never gonna ask her if she'd marry me I know she'd turn me down
Cause I'm just a country boy
Never could afford a store bought ring with the sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford is a loving heart the only one I own
Cause I'm just a country boy"
"When a woman cries, when a woman cries
She can wash your world away
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
You never know just what to say
Don't say a word, don't say anything
She don't need your truth or lies
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, when a woman cries
There is no sadder song
So you apologize
Even if you don't know what you did wrong
But if you really want to make her happy
To stop her sobbing and her sighs
Just hold her close and love her
When a woman cries
Now don't you waste your time thinkin'
Of the right thing to say
Just put your arms around her
'til the clouds roll away
When a woman cries, when a woman cries
She can tear your world apart
When storms fill her eyes, when storms fill her eyes
It can break a, break a man's heart
And if you find that you are cryin' too
Don't let it come as no surprise
Just hold her close and love her
When your woman cries"
"A herd of wild horses, a stampede of cows
The sheriff's department with a pack of bloodhounds
Ain't ever gonna move me away from your side
I'm off and running
I'll be here forever now
I've made up my mind
I'd rather drive across Texas in a stolen car
With the rangers on my tail and no head start
I'd rather draw my last breath with a bullet in my heart
Than ever drive away from you
I'll never drive away from you
Take the Wichita River, jumping in space
Throw in a tornado and a couple of earthquakes
They just ain't strong enough to pull us apart
You told me that you love me
Nothing's ever gonna drag me out of your arms
I'd rather drive across Texas in a stolen car
With the rangers on my tail and no head start
I'd rather draw my last breath with a bullet in my heart
Than ever drive away from you
I'll never drive away from you
I'd rather drive across Texas in a stolen car
With the rangers on my tail and no head start
I'd rather draw my last breath with a bullet in my heart
Than ever drive away from you
I'd rather drive across Texas in a stolen car
With the rangers on my tail and no head start
I'd rather draw my last breath with a bullet in my heart
Than ever drive away from you
No, I'll never drive away
I'd rather draw my last breath with a bullet in my heart
Than ever drive away from you"
"I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
From holding crazy faith
I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke, it rises higher
Glowing crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Am I a fool for hanging long?
Would I be a fool for being long gone?
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith?
The questions will not let me sleep
The dance is buried way too deep
But the bottom lover, lover's keep
Made by crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me
Love, you're losing those you love
Let the hope fly from the glove
Do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith
Love is lightning, love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once or you will know the price
And once for crazy faith
You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know, but my faith says so"
"I wonder should I tell you
'Bout all the crazy things I've ever done?
I've been searching all my life
And when I should have stayed, I tried to run
I was searching for an answer
In a world full of strangers
But what I found was never real enough
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Darlin' you've been good to me
You are so much more than I deserve
I never thought that I would find
Someone who's so sweet and kind like you
Please believe me when I say
This time I won't run away
I swear by all of heaven's stars above
Now that I've found you
I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever
I can see you and me walking in this old world together
Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of
Now that I've found you, I'm looking in the eyes of love
Looking in the eyes of love I can see forever
I can see you and me walking in this old world together
Lord my heart's found a home I've been dreaming of
Now that I've found you, I'm looking in the eyes of love"
"I should go home, but I'm not sure I have one
The bottle holds the first place in my life
I live out of control, in smoky places
And I'm ashamed of how it hurts my wife
'Cause it's bottom of the fifth and I'm still wantin' more
She opt to give me up and even-up the score
'Cause every time I say I'll quit, she knows that it's a myth
When it's five to two and bottom of the fifth
It's hard to change the habits of a full-time drunk
Who lives on hundred proof from dawn 'til dawn
I'd straighten up and change if they'd quit makin' booze
But 'til they do I'll just drink on and on
'Cause it's bottom of the fifth and I'm still wantin' more
She opt to give me up and even-up the score
'Cause every time I say I'll quit, she knows that it's a myth
When it's five to two and bottom of the fifth"
"Looking back from
Where I stand tonight
I wouldn't change
A thing about my life
Wrong turns I
Had to take back
In those crazy years
Could not have been mistakes
If they brought me here
Cause all my roads
Have led me to
This night, this love
I share with you
And though the road
Was never smooth
Life has made me someone who
Could be the right someone for you
I don't regret
A single broken heart
That taught me what love is
And what it's not
Someone must have planned
Our two paths would cross
I couldn't see it then
But I was never lost
Cause all my roads
Detours, dead ends,
Endless explorations
You were my only destination
Cause all my roads.."
"Jumped in the truck and headed for Kansas
Morning found me in Port Aranas
Sipping on rum
In that warm Texas sun
I've never been good at keeping direction
And i believe schedules are one of life's worst inflections
And i gotta be free
'Cause I'd rather nothing
Than a whole lot of something I don't need
I'd rather have nothing
Than a whole lot of something
That don't fit the life that i lead
material things and all that wealth brings
just must be for some other breed
'cause life ain't about the worries and doubts
That comes with the lust and the greed
and i'd rather have nothing
that a whole lot of something we don't need
I spent that evening in a tavern in town
with a bunch of my new friends my money brought 'round
and i told them 'bout you
and all the hell we'd been through
everyone there had a similar story
years full of tears from all the heartache and worry
and we all agreed
that we'd rather have nothing
than a whole lot of something we don't need
i'd rather have nothing
than a whole of something
that don't fit the life that i lead
commintments and strings and all that love brings
just must be for some other breed
'cause life ain't about the worries and doubts
that comes wtih the lust and the greed
and i'd rather have nothing
than a whole lot of something i don't need"
"You're always in the fridge or on the phone
How the hell would you know you're never home
I go to work, to keep this family fed
Good try pal but you won't even get out of bed
I can't believe you spent that much on shoes
Look I got them on sale and you'll never know the money I save you
So I suppose you bought a bag, a dress and a hat
Well, you've got your race car want to talk about that
You look so damn cute when you get mad
It melts away my troubled heart and you don't seem so bad
When I see that twinkle in your eye
We take the phone off the hook and put the kids to bed
Forget what we said and love away the night
You're always on the couch watching football
Bring me a beer and keep it down, will ya
I don't want to miss the score just like you missed our anniversary
Well, I'm sorry babe, but you should have reminded me"
"We lived a beautiful life together not so very long ago
Five years so happy now they are gone
With only a heartache to show
For somewhere she walks down streets of sin and silver
Sin and silver are all she ever needs
Somewhere somewhere somewhere she walks
Where sin and silver leads
[ piano ]
We lived a beautiful life together till I turned him away
All of their gossips destroyed our love
And left me so lonely today
For somewhere she walks down streets..."
"There's a place at the edge of the sky
Where there's a love deep as it is wide
The weak are strong, the hungry are all fed
And there's a breeze from the angels flying overhead
Oh yeah
And there's a path, a glorious light
That guides you up the mountainside
And at the top, if you could you'd cry
'Cause you see pure love for the very first time, mmm
Deep as it is wide
Every breath taking me closer
Every step leading to paradise
They say the faithful get to go there
I believe there's a love
Deep as it is wide
And I hear, when you get to the river
You look back for the very last time
And when you cross, you get washed off forever
Hurry up boy, eternity's on the other side, ohh
Deep as it is wide, yeah
Every breath taking me closer
Every step leading to paradise
They say the faithful get to go there
I believe there's a love
Deep as it is wide
Every nation, color and creed
Like grace pouring out, far as the eye can see
Singing praises up to a King
'Cause He died, for a crown
Deep as it is wide, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every breath taking me closer
Every step leading to paradise
They say the faithful get to go there and
I believe there's a love
I believe in a love, oh yeah
I believe there's a love
Deep as it is wide, oh yeah, oh
There's a place at the edge of the sky
Where there's a love, deep as it is wide"
"I've me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel
Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real
Storms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss and pride
It's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain
I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me
So make up your theories about the scandals and the lies
Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise
When it rains, I don't mind being lonely, I cry right along with the sky
When it rains, I don't pretend to be happy, I don't even have to try
When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in
Yeah, the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way, I'd take the rain"

A woman's love
And I know
I'll never come Face to face
With any thing

Well I have kiss it
Tried to resist it
I have missed
A woman's love
And I have hated
Taken for granted
A woman's love

And I have cursed it

But I promised forever to have and to hold
So I can never be free dear, but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the strength to be true
Please help me, I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation, don't let me walk in
For I shouldn't want you, but darling, I do
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you"
"Someday we're gonna get away and spend some time together
Someday I'll hold you in my arms and not just my dreams

I don't worry, I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
You're like a present with a pretty ribbon shining on a birthday morn
And I'm like a little boy who can't wait to untie the bow
But until the grapes are ripened and the wine is ready to pour
I don't worry, I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
I can tell you're well worth waiting for
Everyday only makes me want you more
It's hard to stand outside and wait this close to heaven's door
But I don't worry, I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for
I don't worry, I'm in no hurry 'cause you're worth waiting for"

You're lookin' for a sign
That somewhere in this heart of mine
There's a place for you

That's what chases me away
But tonight, I just gotta stay and see this through

No you can't say that"
"As I lay here all alone I feel the darkness coming on
It's too late to try to catch the sinking sun
But the seasons of my mind they're walking back through summer time
When the sun was bright and our new love was blind
Roselee won't you come and walk through summertime with me
At your mother's house tonight I kissed the sunshine of my life
As I tucked him in his little baby bed
When I turned to walk away my thoughts ran back to yesterday
When I held you close to me and softly said
Roselee I can see in him a part of you and me
At the market place today I overheard somebody say
In three short weeks you'd marry my best friend
But the seasons of your mind will walk again through summertime
When you feel me in the touch of my son's hand
Roselee you'll be walking with the living end of me
[ guitar ]
With my hand clutched to my head they'll find me in this lonely bed
Where you told me you were through with loving me
Maybe then your seasons mind will walk again through summertime
When our sun is shining six feet over me
Roselee yes your leaving took the living out of me"
"Whistle through my wallet
Rent's due - I ain't got it
I like my water heater
Its's a leaker in my stadium blitzer
Livings gotten easy
Everything I ever wanted
From glasgow and the liquor store
I'm completely satiated
No longer a romantic
I ain't slack-jawed
I am responsible
For the stupid things I say
Like the doctor and the poodle
Are procrastinators
There's a lover dancing and laughing
All the way to his grave ha ha ha ha"
"Ridin' against the wind in East New Mexico
His skin is dry and worn as the Texas plains
He's headed where the air is thin and and the cold blue northers blow
Up through the Raton Pass but he'll have to beat the early snow
The winter of '64 was a great many years ago
When a young man went away for the rebel cause
And he was branded by the war and the only life he'd know
Was lookin' over his shoulder saddle bound and layin' low
Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail
Now there's a place just north of here where they say the outlaws go
Where a man can leave his name and past behind
And every now and then you'll hear, he's gone the way of the buffalo
And that he finally made the pass but he didn't beat the early snow
Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail"
"In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of the faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through the tears
She's saying, she's praying.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing
Like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card
And just turn off all the noise.
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, just a bang bang
Rolling off your tongue (I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it, no pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh like little toy guns"
"There'll always be another tear there'll always be another year
There'll be another sky of blue
But no matter what may come or go just one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
There'll always be another smile there'll always be another mile
There'll be another morning dew
Though years may come and years may go this one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
There'll be another teardrop there'll be another raindrop
And there'll be another love that's true
Though love may come and love may go this one thing I surely know
There'll never ever be another you
No there'll never ever be another you"
"Why do we go when the blue sky turn to liquid
and the cold trees stark naked.
Ohio upon the mountain we were growin' up
-So strong.
And I have found a flower that is growin in the forest
and we talked by the hour
Oh we were not lovers, but I loved you.
Oh-oh-oh-oh loved
And oooooh- beautiful clouds
I've been sailing through
Oh golden clouds
I've been sailing through you
Well my mother was a garden of all things unspoken
and my father came around me like a broken little soldier
and my sister, she is wonderin' what the hell is all around us,
but there's beauty over us, but there's beauty over us, ahhhh.
What ya do is sacred and what ya say doesn't matter much.
Your movin' your lips but your mind is on fire.
And now the steam is risin' like I did all once a- a love came right through me from above and I sang up to my God and he saved me once again. Waaahaaa..
And if you have a brother than you can understand what it is to love and grow up to love....... and things get shattered.
And oooooh- beautiful clouds,
I've been sailing though,
Oh golden clouds.
I go sailing through you."
"there's a letter on the office floor
I'm off to the great kaleidoscope
just a letter and nothing more
I'm off to the great kaleidoscope
will you leave me with a kiss
though I've warned you of the mystery
in that grim northern rim
there's a swallow on your mother's lawn
I ring her doorbell til my finger broke
I asked the swallow where my love has gone
she's off to the great kaleidoscope
will my future be revealed
with the turning of a wheel
in that grim northern rim"
"Oh, there you are, all alone at the bar
Heaven knows you're something to see
And so I say hi, try out my best lie
You cross your long legs and smile back at me
Oh, you say I'm nice, you say I'm sweet
Well baby I must have you fooled
'Cause I know damn well they could put me in jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you
(Chorus)
I could get twenty years for what's goin' on here
Honey, right inside of my head
If society knew what I'm doing to you,
I'm sure they'd make me pay my debt
Any jury would find it's a terrible crime
They'd do what they had to do
Yeah, I know damn well they could put me in jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you
I say, 'Tell me love, do you come in here much'
You say, 'Oh from time to time'
Yeah, I'm talking to you but while I do
a whole lot of things are going on in my mind
Oh I try to hide what I'm thinking inside
'Cause if anybody ever knew
Yeah, I know damn well they could put me jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you
(Chorus)
Yeah, I know damn well they could put me jail
for what I been thinkin' 'bout you"
"I didn't know you were gonna be at that bar when I walked in
Til I walked in
I looked up, saw your face, turned around
And I walked back out again
Then I thought there's too much that we shared
So I made myself get ahold of myself
And walked back in
And went right up to you
I could feel you were caught off guard
Neither one of us knew just what to do
So I said
How ya been, been a while
Tell me how's your Mama
You said Good, you can sit down if you wanna
I said I was just thinkin' bout Oklahoma
The wild roller coaster ride we had that summer
Before we knew it we were on our 2nd glass of wine
Sittin' there talkin' just like
We had never said goodbye
Well even after all that time well it clicked just like before
Maybe a little more
Before we knew it they were closing up the joint
Yea, stackin' them chairs
Lockin' them doors
I asked the waitress would she mind if we slept there
And stayed for breakfast
We both laughed
You grabbed your purse
I paid our tab
Standing underneath the moon
I couldn't help but ask
What you say we take a stroll down by the river
What a night, girl can you believe this weather
I been thinking we were pretty damn good together
You said yea wonder why did we ever let it go
I said I don't know but after seeing you tonight
Well It feels just like
We had never said goodbye
Never said goodbye
I been thinking maybe we should give it one more try
Like we never said good bye"
"When the warship's left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
All the sailors hearts were filled with fond regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty girl they've met
(Well up stopped a little sailor with his pride eyes all aglow
Saying take a look at my girl's photograph)
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my trasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby
[ steel ]
In a little rustic cottage in the port of Filipines dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
(She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone)
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby..."
"She's 98 lbs. workin' down at the Dairy Queen
With an Oval V home perm and braces
And he's long haired, no job and just 19
They've got a baby on the way and
They're off to the races
In love look at 'em go
Now what in the world could go wrong?
Don't tell them the odds
Its best they don't know
If love was a plane, nobody'd get on
At the ivy at lunchtime in Beverly Hills
The paparazzi are gathered outside
'Cause an actor and an actress are havin' lunch
And according to Extra and Entertainment Tonight
They're in love look at 'em go
Now what in the world could go wrong?
Don't tell them the odds
It's best they don't know
If love was a plane nobody'd get on
Imagine now the pilots voice on the intercom
Right before we leave the ground
Saying folks thanks for flying with us
But there's a six in ten chance we're goin' down
But that's the strangest thing about this emotion
Even knowing our chances are small
We line up at the gate with our tickets
Thinking somehow we're different
I mean after all
We're in love look at us go
Now what in the world could go wrong?
To hell with the odds we'd rather not know
If love was a plane, nobody'd get on
Ya, if love was a plane nobody'd get on"
"You give your hand to me and then you say hello and I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone could tell you think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too"
"What am I gonna do girl what am I gonna do I love you so much what am I gonna do
What am I gonna do girl what am I gonna do I love you so much what am I gonna do
Sittin' here and thinkin' bout you so far away
Wondering what you're thinkin' wondering what you'd say
If you were sittin' here beside me here alone beside me
Used to be so good with you baby baby
What am I gonna do what am I gonna do I love you so much what am I gonna do
You left me here alone said it all takes time
I should keep the place together keep everything in line
Why aren't you sittin' here beside me here alone beside me
Till you come back to me baby baby
What am I gonna do"
"Jolly old Saint Nicholas lean your ear this way
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm going to say
Christmas Eve is coming soon now you dear old man
Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can
When the clock is striking twelve, when I'm fast asleep
Down the chimney broad and black with your pack you'll creep
All the stockings you will find hanging in a row
Mine will be the shortest one you'll be sure to know
Johnny wants a pair of skates Susie wants a dolly
Nelly wants a storybook, she thinks dolls are folly
As for me my little brain isn't very bright
Choose for me old Santa Claus what you think is right
Jolly old Saint Nicholas lean your ear this way
Tell me if you can
(Jolly, Jolly, Jolly, Jolly old Saint Nick)"
"feeling is believing and believing is the feeling you get when thatloving feelings gone, everything he ever did and any thing hel be again packed up his bags and moved along"
"Of all the people in this world, why you and I
With lovers here and everywhere we don't care enough to try
Why couldn't all the hurt we're feeling now have passed us by
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
And of all the hearts in all the world, why yours and mine
There's so many places love could die, we must leave the earth for a time
Oh, but it's in our hearts and it's in our bed and it's even in your eyes
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
Somewhere out there there's lovers who want to be free
Why couldn't love have died with them instead of here with you and me
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life
Couldn't love have picked a better place to die?
Oh, but it's pitiful how all these tears won't bring it back to life"
"Well if I had money
Tell you what I'd do
I'd go downtown and buy a mercury or two
Crazy bout a mercury
Lord I'm crazy bout a mercury
I'm gonna buy me a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Well the girl I love
I stole her from a friend
He got lucky, stole her back again
She heard he had a mercury
Lord she's crazy bout a mercury
I'm gonna buy me a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Well hey now mama
You look so fine
Ridin round in your mercury 49
Crazy bout a mercury
Lord I'm crazy bout a mercury
I'm gonna buy me a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road
Well my baby went out
She didn't stay long
Bought herself a mercury, come a cruisin home
She's crazy bout a mercury
Yeah she's crazy bout a mercury
And cruise it up and down the road"
"Six o'clock on Friday evening
Momma doesn' t know she's leaving
'Til she hears the screen door slamming
Rubber squealin', gears a-jamming
Local country station just a blaring on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you better get your red head
Back in bed before the morning
Nine o'clock the show is ending
But the fun is just beginning
She knows he's anticipating
But she's gonna keep him waiting
Grab a bite to eat
And then they're heading to the honkey tonk
But loud crowds and line dancing
Just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
And where it's George Strait 'til real late
And dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing
Midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking
Two is coming, still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
Four o'clock get up and going
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up
Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well here he comes around the bend
Slowing down, she's jumping in
Hey mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't goin' down 'til the sun comes up"
"In the bleak mid winter
Frosty winds made moan
Earth as hard as iron
Water like a stone
Snow has fallen snow on snow
Snow on snow
In the bleak mid winter
Long long ago
What can i give Him,poor as I am
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb
If i were a wise man,I would do my part
Yet what can i give him ,give my heart
In the bleak mid winter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone"
"Written by billy burnette.
I'm always wondering about you, babe
Bout all the times you've walked away
And I'll always miss you when you go
Cause the way I feel well you just don't know
Let's head on down the road together
Where the air I'd clean and there's love and sunny weather
We'll hide away in our fields of green by a winding stream
In our world of make believe
It's just that look that's in your eyes
Something about you I idealize
I feel as though I'm bout to lose my mind
Just trying to catch up but I'm so far behind"
"On the cross of Calvary our blessed Saviour died,
Gave His life to save the world from loss;
In His pain and agony, for every sin to hide,
Shed the blood that stained the old rugged cross.
[CHORUS]
'Twas His blood, His precious blood that stained the old rugged cross,
'Twas His love that paid the awful cost;
Oh soul so far astray come and plunge today
In the blood that stained the old rugged cross
[ guitar ]
To the cross, the rugged cross they nailed His precious hands
And in death He fully paid the cost,
There is pardon in His love for everyone that stands
For the blood that stained the old rugged cross
[repeat Chorus]
What an awful death He died to pardon you and me,
All alone in agony He tossed,
And a world once lost in sin can now be wholly free
By the blood that stained the old rugged cross.
[repeat chorus]"
"There's a pool hall juke box, sawdust floors
Three plays for a quarter, and we still want more
Yeah there's a reason for fast cars
And that double yellow line
Heartbreak songs and good cheap two dollar wine
'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
I got a second hand boat, the last numbers in jail
There's second hand smoke, everywhere i exhale
There's greasy little truckstops, all night di
No-tell Motel's and everybody knows why
'Cause of people like us
There's honky tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
'Cause of people like us
There's honkey tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
Oh at last call the lights go up
'Cause of people ... people like us
There's honkey tonk music, long neck bottles
Rusty old pickup trucks
And at last call the lights go up
And its all because of people like us
Late night people like us
Hard lovin people like us
Hahah, just fun lovin people like us
Hillbilly people like us!"
"From what I've seen, you're magnificent
You fight evil with all you do
Your every act is spectacular
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I hear, you are generous
You make sunshine and glory too
When you walk in things go luminous
It makes me lay here and love you
From what I know, you're terrified
You have mistrust running through you
Your smile is hiding something hurtful
It makes me lay here and love you
It makes me lay here and love you
I'm filled with violet and red and blue
I have a feeling from what I do
That you might lay there and love me too"
"You could say I'm a little bit crazy
You could call me insane
Walkin' 'round with all these whispers
Runnin' 'round here in my brain
I just can't help but hear 'em
Man, I can't avoid it
I hear voices
I hear voices like
My dad sayin', ""Work that job
But don't work your life away""
And mama tellin' me to drop some cash
In the offerin' plate on Sunday
And granddad sayin', ""You can have a few
But don't ever cross that line""
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard-to-find words of wisdom
Holed up here in my mind
And just when I've lost my way
Or I've got too many choices
I hear voices
I hear voices like
My dad sayin', ""Quit that team
And you'd be a quitter for the rest of your life""
And mama tellin' me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And grandma sayin', ""If you find the one
You better treat her right""
Yeah, I hear voices all the time
Sometimes I try to ignore 'em
But I thank God for 'em
'Cause they made me who I am
My dad sayin', ""Work that job
But don't work your life away""
And mama tellin' me to drop some cash
In the offerin' plate on Sunday
And granddad sayin', ""You can have a few
But don't ever cross that line""

"You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to break
You wonder why
I want to fall apart that way
Crack my reason
Wearing you pretty face
Dropped me a couple times
I come around anyway
Demolition by words
Wrecked all over town
Working for one break
Head down, passed out
You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to hide
Your friends don't know me
And they wonder where you go
Take it on another phone
Put-downs in code
I've got my own ring
You might not be alone
Leave me everywhere
Waking up on a floor
Locked in a nightclub
Breaking out the back door
You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to break"
"Momma's tears fell so easy
Daddy's handshake was strong
Then I climbed aboard that Greyhound
Eighteen and glad to be gone
Took a rented room on Broadway
And as I unpacked everything I owned
I found a note my mama left me
With a Bible and a bus ticket home
It said one will get you where you're going
When you haven't got a prayer
And one will bring you back, son
If your dreams ain't waiting there
You're out on your own now
We won't be there to fall back on
But you know we're never farther than
A Bible and a bus ticket home
The years have come and gone and taken
The only things in life I ever counted on
But I'm going back tomorrow
To lay flowers at their stone
I can almost hear my mama calling saying
Son come back where you belong
You've got all you need to get here
A Bible and a bus ticket home
It said one will get you,
Boy, you know we're never farther than
A Bible and a bus ticket home"
"Look at the couple in the corner booth
Looks a lot like me and you
She's looking out at the window
He's staring down at his shoes
She gets another glass of Cabernet
She's searching hard for something to say
He's got that little too late look on his already gone face
Look through each other like a piece of glass
Is that what happens when the years fly past?
Lately I've been feeling like that
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
Tell me you're uncomfortably numb
I can't imagine I'm the only one
Is goodbye on the tip of your tongue
Any love left, gotta be some
Why'd you bring me to my favorite place?
A little wine and everything's OK
Are we really gonna end this way?
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
You break the bread and you break my heart
You raise the glass as we fall apart
Guess it's time for a coming to Jesus
Looks like that just might be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Looks like it's out last supper
Look at the couple in the corner booth
Looks a lot like me and you"
"Today my heart is burden I'm back to settle down
I saw the bright lights of the city I'd have all the joys of town
But there was something missing while I was roamin' round
Now I know just what was missing the little girl in my hometown
I'm back but I am too late cause she just married a friend
She waited for me lonely years for all my roaming to end
She were tired of just waiting for a love that let her down
I lost my only real true love the little girl in my hometown
[ steel ]
It's my heart that I've broken as no one has to blame
I could try now to win her but that might cause her shame
So I'll travel down this lonesome road till journey's end I'll find
I'll always love I can't forget the little girl in my hometown
I didn't mean to forget her when I went away
Ramble's all I cared to do didn't know I'd have to pay
I didn't mean to be untrue to her didn't mean to let her down
I lost my only real true love the little girl in my hometown"
"I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you
As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, there's good in goodbye
I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I'm happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'll see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet
As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When you're holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes, there's good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah"
"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times,
Doin' things that you don't understand.
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
even though he's hard to understand.
And if you love him Oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man.
Stand By Your Man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to
when nights are cold and lonely.
Stand By Your Man,
And tell the world you love him.
Giving all the love you can.
Stand By Your Man."
"So long we've been married
Life's burdens we carried
Though they kept us humble and made our love true
The plans that we make up
Someone seems to break up
Oh, darlin', what else can we do?
[Chorus]
We may have to leave here
To find peace of mind, dear
Some place where we can live a life all our own
For I know you love me, and happy we could be
If some folks would leave us alone
While I go out walkin'
There's of loose talkin'
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But, darlin', it's not true
Because I still love you
And I do with all my heart
[Chorus]
They say that you're leavin'
That you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them they're wrong
That loose talk will do harm
And hope that the truth they will see
[Chorus]"
"You've got an eye for diamonds and things that shine
You want a slick black Jag and a cellar of wine
I'd have to hold two jobs to keep you in my arms
And I don't wanna work that hard
I met your Mama and she turned up her nose
At my dirty work boots and my co-op clothes
Ain't gonna kiss her butt just to win her heart
No, I don't wanna work that hard
I don't wanna work for something
That's only gonna add up to nothing
Girl, I gonna miss your loving
Knowing how sweet your kisses are
But you're always asking me to watch your dog
Bathe em and to feed em, take him out for a walk
Well, he's a hundred and eighty pound Saint Bernard
Hell, I don't wanna work that hard
And your old boyfriend is still hanging on
He's and ex-black belt with a jealous bone
Don't wanna have to whop him out behind some bar
No, I don't wanna work that hard
I don't wanna work for something
That's only gonna add up to nothing
Girl, I gonna miss your loving
Knowing how sweet your kisses are
I don't wanna work for something
That's only gonna add up to nothing
Girl, I gonna miss your loving
Knowing how sweet your kisses are
I'd have to hold two jobs to keep you in my arms
Kiss your Mama's butt and your Saint Bernard's
Whop your ex-boyfriend at some bar
And I don't wanna work that hard
Baby, I ain't gonna work that hard"
"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes"
"Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
Surrounded by strangers
She don't know the dangers
One drink could lead to two
And if she fails, it's all my fault
For doin' a good woman wrong
I can't be far behind her
Oh Lord, help me find her
Before my angel is gone
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that Heaven without her
Feels like Hell tonight
Last night when she left I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not sure how long her tears could last
In a stranger's arms
She's wounded I know and feeling so low
She could fall at any time
I don't know what I would do
If I were to lose that precious angel of mine
Looking for my blue angel
The same one that flew from my arms last night
If you see my blue angel
Tell her that Heaven without her
Feels like Hell tonight"
"THERE ARE SOME THINGS
(Bill Anderson - Red Hayes)
'68 Stallion Music
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH
You can't see a mem'ry of love that's untrue
Hear a tear fall or a heart break in two
You can't draw on paper the picture of pain
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears when it dies
A heart sheds no tears still you know that it cries
You can't see how empty a soul is inside
There are some things words just won't describe
You can't see the future though you've known the past
Or know how long a love hurt will last
Blue mem'ries burn though you don't see the flame
There are some things you just can't explain
You can't see where love disappears...
There are some things you just can't explain"
"I think today's gonna be the day, all my luck's gonna turn
I think the boss'll take what I'm worth, and turn it into what I earn
I'm thinkin' if I keep my chin held high, I can stop my hopes from sinkin'
That's the one thing gets a poor boy by: big thinkin'
Friday night when the city lights call, the devil inside me responds
In the back of my mind I see it all, the bourbon and the red-hot blondes
And a man on his doorstep showin' no signs, of a long hard night of drinkin'
I think I'm gonna fool her every time: big thinkin'
Galileo had quite an I.q., he got to thinkin' and the world moved
I wish he could step into my shoes and look at what thoughts won't do
One day I think I'm gonna ride behind the wheel of a long black lincoln
And I won't be in a box of pine: big thinkin'
Well, it might look like I'm killin' time, layin' on the couch all day
But I'm busy hatchin' my next big move, not wastin' my life away
If the fat cats knew what I could do, what big checks they'd be inkin'
But you can't pay bills when your only skill's: big thinkin'
Columbus thought 'til he turned blue,
And suddenly the map looked brand new
But take out the money and the musclebound crew,
And look at what thoughts won't do"
"You don't have to cry when I say goodbye, goodbye
You know I'll be coming back real soon
And when I do, you know
It will be such a sweet hello
Rising like the sun above the sky line, sky line
Love is brighter than ever before
And that should be understood
When I said ""I do,"" you knew I would
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Let me lay your head upon my pillow, baby
Whisper what you need to me, my dear (my dear)
Don't worry, close your eyes
Morning will find me by your side
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so
Two hearts can be one together
My love tells me so
Give me a chance and I'll sing for you
I have a song for you
To be with you is a dream
I dream of you
Some things can be good forever
My love tells me so"
"Well he yelled out from the back row
look here preacher man
We all know you're new here
but you need to understand
It don't really scare us
when you yell and shake your fist
You see we already know that hell exists
Its six months short of thirty years
when the boss man lays you off
No thinking you no pair of shoes no shiny new gold watch
Its payments that you cant make on a house you cant sell
See a man don't have to die to go to hell
No you don't have to die to go to hell
So tell us bout them angels and how they fly around and sing
Tell us how to get there cause we all want to be
Resting in the arms of Jesus no shame or pain or tears
There's hell enough to go around down here
Its a place out by the airport
where the girls dance just for you
And all you feel is drunk and broke and lonely when their through
Its waking up with nothing but that stale tobacco smell
See a man don't have to die to go to hell
Nah you don't have to die to go to hell
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Its every other weekend and Wednesdays with your kid
And knowing that he'll hate you when he finds out what you did
'Cause you'd all still be together if you loved his momma well
There ain't no end to the stories we could tell
Yeah a man don't have to die to go to hell
So tell us bout them angels how they fly around and sing
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh"
"I feel so alone as I walk from my home with no one to help me share my blues
Oh what could be worse than be born with a curse
That everything you love you always lose
I don't feel like talkin' I just feel like walkin' and keep on a hummin' uh uh uh
[ steel ]
I'd feel better inside if I'd let go my pride
Tell all my friends exactly what you've done
But what good would it do I still wouldn't have you
Forgive me if I cry and walk and hum
I don't feel like talkin' I just feel like walkin' and keep on a hummin' uh uh uh"
"Little by little, round by round
Weve been caught in the middle
Two hearts breakin down
Weve been fightin each other
With our backs to the wall
And little by little, were losin it all
We saw it comin, the end of the line
Weve been hurting each other, time after time
Over and over, we ignored what we saw
And little by little were losin it all
Your fault or my fault, nobody cares
It no longer matters, there's just nothing there
But a few tiny pieces waiting to fall
And little by little we're losin' it all
We saw it comin, the end of the line
Weve been hurting each other, time after time
Over and over, we ignored what we saw
And little by little were losin it all"
"When you called me and said you had to see me
I thought you meant to start our life anew
But you told me you would wed tomorrow
And you just wanted one last rendezvous
Tonight is our last night together at dawn
Till tomorrow you'll be gone
But darling, this night would last forever
If I could hold back the dawn
When you walk down the aisle with him tomorrow
To take his name and whisper 'Dear, I do'
Will you be thinkin' of the future, darling
Or thinkin' of my last night with you
I wish you'd never mention your tomorrow
Darling, when you call me on the phone
But there wouldn't be a new tomorrow
If I could hold back the dawn"
"Together we stand
Divided we fall
Come on now people let's get on the ball
Let's work together
Come on come on let's work together
Make someone happy
Make someone smile
Let's all work together and make life worthwhile
Let's work together
Come on come on let's work together
Together we will stand every boy
Every woman and man
2 or 3 minutes
2 or 3 hours
What does it matter in this life of ours
Come on come on let's work together
Together we will stand every boy
Every woman and man
When things go wrong as they sometimes will
When the road that you travel seems all up hill
Come on come let's work together
Together we still stand every boy
Every woman and man"
"Looking back
On the memory of
The dance we shared
'Neath the stars above
For a moment
All the world was right
How could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye
And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance
Holding you
I held everything
For a moment
Wasn't I a king
But if I'd only known
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say
You know I might have changed it all
And now
I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end
The way it all would go
Our lives
Are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd have had to miss
The dance"
"This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you
We'll just belong together and dance round and round the room
Playing our favorite records humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
[ guitar ]
We'll just belong together..."
"(Who's next to be who's next to me to be the first on your list)
I was the first one to hold you in my arms
I was the first one to capture all your charms
I was the first one to ever make you fall
You were playin' a game with my love to shame and I wasn't the first one at all
So who's next to take my place who's next to share your embrace
Who's next to kiss your lips
Who's next to be who's next to me to be the first on your list
[ guitar ]
The people they told me what you would put me through
But I wouldn't listen I thought your love was true
Now I know better it's plain for me to see
After you took my heart and broke it apart you really didn't love me
So who's next to take my place...
Who's next to take my place...
Who's next to take my place..."
"The sun is slowly sinkin'
The day's almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
The darkest hour is just before dawn
Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A-watchin' the sheep down below
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul
Let Jesus in
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The darkest hour is just before dawn"
"I heard my neighbor's rooster crow
Early in the day
I heard his axe beyond the hill
And now I'm bound away
For some men love the city life
Some men crave the town
But I'll be bound for the lonesome woods
Where I can settle down
[Chorus]
Fiddle and a bow and the fire light's glow
You can hear that lonesome sound
I'll leave behind my troublin' mind
And go the whole world 'round
The red squirrel leaves when the gray squirrel comes
The eagle nests alone
A hundred miles from a wagon track
Is where I'll build my home
[Chorus]
I've seen the old man whittlin' wood
I've seen the streets of town
I'll pack my goods for the Arkansas woods
And there I'll settle down
[Chorus: x2]"
"Somewhere on the Prairie, a yellow stud runs free
Runnin' through the sage brush, down through the coolies
There not far behind him, a cowboy rides along
He's gonna try to catch him and break him for his own
The chase goes on all morning and late into the day
The cowboy changes horses, he staked along the way
The stud is growin' weaker, now and gettin' short of wind
He runs into the trap corral, the cowboy shuts him in
The yellow stud with wild eye, the feared hated man
Finally standin' face to face in the hot and dusty sand
The battle starts and rages on beneath the burning sun
Cowboy tried but couldn't ride that yellow outlaw stud
So he sold him to a Rodeo and it spread throughout the land
The legend of this yellow stud, the baddest of the bad
And then one day in Cheyenne we knew it had to come
The best of all Bronc riders, he drew that yellow stud
The wooden gate flew open and the stud, he bailed out high
An explosion of yellow horse seemed to fill the sky
The stud kept getting stronger and thrashing up the earth
Cowboy blew a stirrup, crashed into the dirt
So violently the stud had bucked that he slipped and fell
As he went down back his backbone snapped the yellow stud lay still
Well, his cowboys gathered 'round him, I heard one of 'em say
There'll never be another Bronc like the one that died today
But out there on the Prairie there's a mare with Mustang blood
And a colt runs close behind her, a yellow outlaw stud"
"Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shooting for some food,
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude
(Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea)
Well the first thing you know old Jed's a millionaire
Kin folk said Jed move away from there
Said California is the place you oughta be
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills that is, swimming pools, movie stars)
Well now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Beverly Hillbillies, that's what they call 'em now,
Nice folks Y'all come back now, ya hear?)"
"Come in as you tread life's journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safely
Without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the ending of your pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet our Savior
You'll surely meet Him on that day
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er
That awful Day of Judgment
Is coming in the by and by
We'll see our Lord descending
In Glory from on high
So let us keep in touch with Jesus
And in his grace the Love of God
That we may be ever called ready
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er"
"Couldn't breathe this morning, I had a dream.
We were in a room papered with memories.
And though our pictures were plastered on the wall,
you didn't recognize me at all.
Wish there was a way to never sleep again
because I can't stop these dreams, they always let you in.
Chorus:
Maybe if I told you 'I need you', you'd still need me,
Maybe if I'd asked you to stay, you'd be here,
Maybe if I'd told you I'd loved you since we'd first met,
But you're a memory now,
And maybe I should just forget.
So you've ruined my morning, but that's all I'll allow,
I pull a smile on, and push you out for now,
Keeping busy, I keep you away,
But I lose the battle with the fading day.
Wish there was a way to never sleep again
because I can't stop these dreams, they always let you in.
Chorus:
Maybe if I told you 'I need you', you'd still need me,
Maybe if I'd asked you to stay, you'd be here,
Maybe if I'd told you I'd loved you since we'd first met,
But you're a memory now,
Insomnia, you're my insomnia, you're my insomnia, let me sleep.
Insomnia, you're my insomnia, you're my insomnia, let me be.
But I can't forget the things I meant to say,
when dreams get in the way."
"Written by billy burnette.
Oh susan, I'm losin' control
I don't know what to do
'cause this feelin' I keep feelin'
About you, sue
I'm gonna leave it up to you
Well, I got you on my mind
You got me anytime
You got me in your hip pocket
I think it's just a little too late to stop
It now
Oh susan, I'm losin' control
I don't know what to do
'cause this feelin' I keep feelin'
About you sue
I'm gonna leave it up to you

"Ain't done one single thing this morning except for crying all night long
Ain't had no loving since you've been gone
And I ain't a gonna get no loving till you come home
Nothings been the same since you left me everything has gone from right to wrong
Ain't had no loving since you've been gone
And I ain't a gonna get no loving till you come home
Smiles of yesterday now find me crying the red and golden rainbow turned to blue
With every breath I take I feel like dying
Life just ain't worth living when I ain't got you
Each and every day I've spent without you is one more hurting lonely day too long
Ain't had no loving since you've been gone
And I ain't a gonna get no loving till you come home
Ain't had no loving since you've been gone
And I ain't a gonna get no loving till you come home"
"I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted
How's the world treating you?
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do?
Are you lonesome without me?
Have you found someone new?
Are you burning and yearning?
Do you ever get blue?
Do you think of returning?
How's the world treating you?"
"There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Matches I can strike
To set afire the memory of you
Up goes down
Right's gone left me behind
Wheels spin 'round
Reverse stuck in my mind
There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could break
To make 'em feel as broken as I do
Stack up every barrel
Since the day it was made
Satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
But there ain't enough
Kisses from a stranger
On a long wild night to ever make it alright
If it ain't you
In my arms, in my bed
Yeah to hell with all the rest
Once you've had the best, nothing else will do
What's the use
There ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do
With my mouth wide open
In a whiskey rain
I could stand there 24 hours a day
But there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
No there ain't enough
Bottles I could drink
To make 'em feel as empty as I do
No there ain't enough
Bourbon in Kentucky
For me to forget you
So forget you"
"When the first hint of sunshine
Peeks between the window blinds
And the morning hits my pillow
The sweetest dream is left behind
I'd rather die than face a new day
'Cause I always wake to find
That I'm feeling just as lonely
As the day you said goodbye
Can you feel me reaching for you
In the middle of the night
What I'd give to hold you, darling
Within these arms of mine
Can you feel me reaching for you
In the middle of the night
What I'd give to hold you, darling
Within these arms of mine
All my heartache would be over
If my dream came true one time
Then I wouldn't have to live with
The day you said goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye"
"O CHRISTMAS TREE

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, how true you stand unchanging, O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, how true you stand unchanging, Your boughs so green in summertime remain so green in wintertime. O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, how true you stand unchanging.

"Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don't change soon, he will.
Oh, man has invented his doom,
First step was touching the moon.
Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there as the night grows still.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill,
Then they bury him with stars,
Sell his body like they do used cars.
Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there facin' the hill.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused,
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But there's a woman on my block,
Sitting there in a cold chill.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker,
Heartbreaker, back breaker,
Leave no stone unturned.
May be an actor in a plot,
That might be all that you got
'Til your error you clearly learn.
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Oh, man is opposed to fair play,
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there as the night grows still.
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"I always will remember those sultry desert nights
(Our) hearts burning with a passion
Whoa, it's never felt so right
It was meant to last forever but when I reached out you were gone
It's taken time to mend this broken heart and forget you done me wrong
Now you're back after all this time
You've reawakened all the feelings that I've tried so hard to hide
But baby
Will you love me like you loved me yesterday?
That's all I need to know
Will you love me like you loved yesterday?
Or will you just let me go?
We could leave the pain behind us take a shot at love again
We could fool ourselves believing that our love would never end
I've been missing you, whoa, what should I do?
Did you really have a change of heart
Or are you playing me for a fool?
You don't have to tell me where you've been
But there is one thing I've gotta know before I let you in Baby"
"Tonight I'm all alone no place to call my own
Don't have no one to love me anymore
I'm gonna pack up my grip and take a long long trip
Back to the one that I love so
Oh I long to go back to my darling
Back to the one I love so well
I know she'll be my wife and we'll settle down for life
Cause she's the one that means the world to me
I can't forget the day I left and went away
You told you me I'd be sorry some old day
I found it to be true so I'm heading back to you
Sweetheart I'm tired and I want to settle down
When I get back to her my rambling days are over
We'll build a little cottage on the hill
We'll think of days gone by sweetheart just you and I
And there we'll live so happy ever more"
"Some may say, that an empty-handed man
Will do all he can to hold someone again
But I say to hell with it all
Till there ain't nothin' left to condemn
And like the wind guides the sailor
I raise up the anchor, and drift
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I lean upon
I'm movin' on
By the wayside, far away from you
Where I thought time would heal
Faster than I could feel blue
And I find myself at a bitter, wounded road
Where in all of its glory is a story
That's best left untold
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I leaned upon
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Break down the wall that I leaned upon
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
Face a new dawn, sing a new song
I'm movin' on"
"I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on
Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
We can do some livin'
or spend our whole lives hopin'
In the end we're left with
The ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open"
"A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
Well a poor boy's chances
For a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money,
If you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you
A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree"
"Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him he blames her
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is
And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie bout where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take a little ring
And bring it into pieces that'll never go back again
Cheatin' is the part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for
A stranger here a stranger there then you turn around and swear
That you'll never go back for more
And laying at night when you're holding him tight
Is sometimes that a cheater's heart just has to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return
The worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mommie and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
But the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose"
"They took away our dogtags, they had us grow our hair
They gave us student visas when we were over there
They staged us out of Hondo al este del Salvador
I guess you'd call us Contras but no one calls much no more
There aint no fun in killin folk and I dont wanna do no more
My great great rode at Shiloh and Grandpa drove a tank
Daddy was air cavalry, flew choppers in Da Nang
I worked mostly clandestine, the branch I should not say {CIA}
We played with better guns and I could use the extra pay
Did Reagan give the order? Did cocaine pay the bill?
They said we's fightin' communists but it was kinda hard to tell
There aint no fun in killin folk and I dont wanna do no more
This was before Blackhawks and RPGs were king
My buddy on the door gun, he never felt a thing
When our Huey caught a rocket and both the pilots killed
And it pitched us over sideways on some Nicaraguan hill
My back felt like its broken, my legs I could not feel
I kept on shooting communists but it was kind of hard to tell
There aint no fun in killin folk and I aint gonna do no more
I never did heal up right from injuries sustained
Officially in Germany, officially while we trained
I remember all their faces, I dream about them still
I guess we's fightin communists but it was kinda hard to tell
There aint no fun in killin folk, and I dont wanna do no more"
"Well I done a lot a singing about stick it to the man
Today's the day he's gonna stick it right back if he can
Having trouble with authority works better in a song
They're gonna take that job and shove it right back at me all day long
Well my last couple head a records they wasn't hits
And the turnout at my shows well it's been down a little bit
I never thought the party'd ever stop
I never thought I'd punch another clock
Well the foreman said ""Hey rock star! Welcome back!""
""Fill out these forms now, we're gonna need your autograph""
Well I remember what I told him when I quit
I remembered, and I cringed a little bit
Well I done a lot a singing about stick it to the man
Today's the day he's gonna stick it right back if he can
Having trouble with authority works better in a song
They're gonna take that job and shove it right back at me all day long
""Well here's your backstage pass to the warehouse boiler room""
That's what he said as he handed me my broom
""Now don't be sittin' down now son it ain't your break time yet""
""I guess you're used to them 75 minute sets""
Well I picked up the pen with the purchase order slips
The boss said ""Watch him boys! He's gonna write a hit!""
""You an artist man, ain't no bout a doubt it!""
""So when you paint the back fence be kind of sensitive about it""
Well I done a lot a singing about stick it to the man
Today's the day he's gonna stick it right back if he can
Having trouble with authority works better in a song
They're gonna take that job and shove it right back at me all day long
Well I woke up on the tour bus in a sweat
From about as bad a nightmare as you can get
Well after all maybe these bad guys ain't so bad
Considering the kind of dreams that I just had
And after all maybe this drive don't seem too long
I think I'm gonna work a little harder on these songs
Well I done a lot a singing about stick it to the man
Today's the day he's gonna stick it right back if he can
Having trouble with authority works better in a song
They're gonna take that job and shove it right back on me all day long
Yeah they're gonna take that job and shove it right back at me all day long!"
"I used to drink my whiskey, careless, fast and dark
Went good with lonely underneath the crooked stars
But that's a million miles away from where we are tonight
Tonight
Let's slow it down and put a timeless record on
'Round and 'round, girl, let's get tangled in a song
Let's pour a glass of what's been waitin' all along, baby
Ah, baby
Summer goes with sunsets like rag-tops with Corvettes
Blue jeans and back roads just like your hand in mine, like
Shadows to the moonlight, cool breeze to a hot night
Like rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with wine
Good with wine
I wanna soak you up, breathe you in like air
Get lost within the sparks flying everywhere
Baby, I can't help it if I'm pouring out my soul
Let's lose ourselves and find ourselves
'Cause baby, don't you know that
Summer goes with sunsets like rag-tops with Corvettes
Blue jeans and back roads just like your hand in mine, like
Shadows to the moonlight, cool breeze to a hot night
Like rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with wine
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Midnight and sweet dreams, love songs and six-strings
Baby, it's a good thing, I'm yours and you are mine, like
Shadows to the moonlight, cool breeze to a hot night
Like rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with
Rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with wine
Good with wine
Good with wine
Good with wine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

"well i partied with some crazy calgary cowgirls
we ripped and snorted, kicked our heels and then
two told me they got olde tyme religion
one says she'll never barrel race again
good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine
i spent some time with texas dave mcdaniel
dippin snuff at nine and drinkin beer by noon
he'd tell me about the bulls he'd rode in waco
by nitefall he'd be howlin at the moon
howlin good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine
look out for them wranglers out in longview
with the left, back pocket worn out of their jeans
they can get you high up in the rockies
so you aint never comin down again
good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine
i knowed about an old alberta oilman
chewed a tin a day till he was ninety two
he passed away a true western original
near the end he liked it sprinkled on his food
he knew that good copenhagen is better than bad cocaine"

You're the one
That made me cry

Now that you're the one
It's happened to
Now you're back
Calling me with open arms
What happened to the one
You met with all that charm
You say he's gone
You're alone

I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

It's happened to
You're begging me to think
About the love we've shared
Yet it seems to me
Not too long ago you didn't care
The love you left
No longer lives
Within my heart
See the game you played
So recklessly
Tore it all apart
And you're the one
You're the one

"I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone
I've seen first-hand Niagara Falls
And the lights of Vegas
I've Criss-crossed down to Key Biscayne
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all
And all I can say is
How 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they something
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, whole round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
She's riding colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard
To fit in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces
Now a-days there ain't as many but
How 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they something
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, whole round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they something
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I'll tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
How 'bout 'em boys"
"On the banks of the river,
Bb F
where the willows hang down
F Am C Dm
And the wild birds all warble
Dm F
with a low moaning sound
F Am C Dm
Down in the hollow,
Dm F
Where the waters run cold,
Bb
It was there I first listened
F
To the lies that you told
Now I lay on my bed
And I see your sweet face.
The past I remeber,
Time cannot erase.
The letter you wrote me,
It was written in shame.
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name.
The nights are so long,
And sorrow runs deep.
And nothing is worse
Than a night with out sleep.
I'll walk out alone
And look at the sky.
Too empty to sing,
Too lonesome to cry.
If the ladies were blackbirds
And the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly, cold marshes.
If the ladies were squirrels
With a high bushy tail
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails."
"There's a church in the valley by the wildwood
No lovelier place in the dale
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale.
How sweet, on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bells
Its tones, so sweetly, are calling
Oh, come to the church in the vale.
Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.
There, close by the church in the valley
Lies one that I loved so well
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 'neath the willow
Disturb not her rest in the vale.
There, close by the side of that loved one
'Neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
When the farewell hymns shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb.
Oh, come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh, come to the church in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale"
"Oh once my heart was light and gay and didn't realize
Until you vanished from my side and opened up my eyes
I balanced up the books on you the answer's very clear
The final total comes into exactly nothin' dear
I'm fillin' up a washing tub of tears I shed for you
And dumpin' in my oldest dreams I've got a job to do
I'm washing all my dreams in tears to rid my misery
And hangin' out on the line that you handed me
[ guitar ]
At night when I lie down to rest instead of coutin' sheep
I count the many lies you told to put myself to sleep
I count the times you cheated to and knowing how you are
I'd like to count them everyone but I can't count that far
I'm fillin' up a washing tub...
[ steel ]
I'll take the brush you used and given me to brush all fear
And brush away my thoughts of you that linger round so near
Put on my walking shoes I got when you gave me the air
Go out and found somebody new someone who really care
I'm fillin' up a washing tub..."
"I'm throwing rice at the girl that I love
After she just said I do
I'm throwing rice with a smile on my lips
But my heart is breaking in two
Oh she was my gal he was my pal
But she loved him better somehow
I stepped aside after I kissed the bride
And I'm throwing rice at her now

Oh I stepped aside..."
"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?
You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""
Darling, I will understand.
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go."
"She said, baby things change
I said, but I feel the same
She said, well let me explain
Baby, how things can change
I said, but that doesn't show
How a love that could grow
Would become so strange
She said, well baby, things change
She said, Na, na, na, na, na
Now, now, now baby, don't try
To figure this out
Or ask questions 'bout why
Forever's a promise
No love can survive
And trust with hearts
Just don't apply
She said,
'Cause baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, now, now
So baby I quit tryin'
To figure things out
About all your hearts lyin'
Forever's a promise
We couldn't survive
Hey, I may be slow
But I ain't blind
She said, I still love you so
I said, I don't care to know
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well baby, things change
And let's don't go placing no blame
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
She said, you once cried my name
I said, well, baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, na

You're my darling you've been true I should have been good to you
You're the one that's in my heart while we're apart
I'll be true I'll prove it to you some day I love you in my heart you'll always stay
I've been so blue and lonesome all these days I love you I'll prove it a thousand ways

I'll be nice and sweet to you and no more will you be blue
I'll prove I love you every day all kinds of ways

"She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car
No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad"
"I keep tellin' myself that it'll be fine
You can't make everybody happy all of the time
I found myself in a place that I never been
A place that I thought that I would never be
There's people looking back at me
I keep having this dream; I'm at a party
There's people throwing drinks and screaming telling me that I don't belong
Lately life's been the same I find this comfortable place
With all my friends then my friends start telling me that I've always been wrong
And I'm so tired of being wrong
There was a time I could move there was a time I could breathe
The crowded spaces filled with angry faces
It didn't once cross my mind
With paranoia on my heels; Will you love me still
when we awake and you find that the sanity has gone from my eyes?
I got secrets from you, you got secrets from me
Because you're so worried about what I'm gonna to think,
Baby I'm worried too
But if love is a game, girl, then you're gonna win
I'll spend the rest of my life bringing victory in
If you want me to"
"There's dust on mother's Bible its pages are worn with age
And though it's old and wrinkled mama's there on every page
The night the angels called her mama called me to her side
And she handed me her old Bible said son let this be your guide
Now I picked up mama's old Bible and to my heart I pressed it tight
And I thought I could hear her whisper ever so gently
Son I'll meet you on the other side
I kissed my mama's old Bible and I wiped away the dust
Oh you'll never know until she's gone how you miss your mother's love"
"I didn't hear the engines of a jet-plane I didn't hear the whistle of a train
I didn't hear the taxi-driver knockin' on my door
I didn't hear her walkin' cross the floor
But my baby packed up my mind and then she left me
She knew when I woke up that I'd be lookin' for my mind
She knew she'd leave a crazy man behind
But my baby packed up my mind and then she left me
I never thought this big ole king size bed would find her gone
I never thought she'd leave here alone
I never saw the distance or the leavin' in her eyes
I never thought my babe would wave goodbye
But my baby packed up my mind
Yes my baby packed up my mind and then she left me"
"Candy kisses wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper
You'd rather have them any old time
You don't mean it when you whisper
Those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than mine do, dear
I build a castle out of dreams, dear
I thought that you were building too
Now my castles all have fallen
And I am left alone and blue
Once my heart was filled with gladness
Now there's sadness, only tears
Candy kisses wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than mine do, dear
Mean more to you than mine do, dear"
"I was feelin' the blues
I was watching the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you
That science has proven
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin'
Without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll
And I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town
So bring me two pina coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan
And never leave dry land
Any troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two pina coladas
She said good-bye to her good timin' man
Oh now I've gotta say
That the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind
By leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile
That goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
I've gotta say
That I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home
So bring me two pina coladas
Gotta have one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan
Oh and never leave dry land
Any troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two pina coladas
She said good-bye to her good timin' man
Bring me bring me two pina coladas

"Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired weak and I'm worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on
When my friends don't understand
And they fail to lend a hand
When my load gets to heavy to bear
As I go along life's way
I just slip away and pray
And dear Lord I can always find you there.
When my way groweth drear
And the night's drawin' near
When my life is almost gone
At that river I stand
Guide my feet Lord, won't you take my hand
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on.
Precious Lord Take My hand lead me on let me stand
Lord I'm tired getting weak and so worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on Lord to that blessed light
Precious Lord take my hand, lead me on."
"They say for everybody there is a fool
And that's the way it's always been
Between me and you
Anytime you're ready you treat me like a friend
Cause you know that I'm just
Following up to take you back again
Yes I'm nobody's fool nobody's fool
Nobody's fool but yours
And although you do me wrong
I'll still tag along
'Cause I'm nobody's fool but yours
You falsely accused me of doing you wrong
That's just an excuse you used to string me along
A toy you play with and when you are through
You throw me away and find somebody knew
But I'm nobody's fool"
"Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
It's too late to go home early
And the crowd is thin and fast
I swear to God the next drink I take
It's gonna be my last
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Still not over you
I've gotta find me a better chaser
To chase away these blues
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
My hung head tung bed good for nothing
A little ? might saw through
Tryna drink you out of my mind
Was more than I could do
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
They say I can keep on drinking
I just can't do it here
But I drunk myself from sober
To a-crying in my bed
Is it a lover or a liver
I really need the most?
I'm tired of thinking with the wrong head
This will be my final toast
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you
My hung head tung bed good for nothing
A little ? might saw through
Tryna drink you out of my mind
Was more than I could do
Last call for alcohol
I'm finally through with you"
"Well, I've done it every way they say it oughta be done
But if I can't be me, well, it ain't much fun
So I bowed out, said, ""I gotta go
Gotta crank it on up, I got to free my soul
So it's back to my roots an' startin' today
I'm ready to rock in a country kinda way
Ready to rock all night long
Yeah, ready to rock 'til the cows come home
Well, it's the same ol' me, so don't be afraid
I'm just ready to rock in a country kinda way
This time I got a guitar that you gotta plug in
An' a stack of screamin' amps twisted way past ten
I'm havin' a ball an' to tell you the truth
I'm back to makin' music like I always do
I got Conway, Jones flowin' through my veins
An' I'm ready rock in a country kinda way

I'm just a-ready to rock, yeah, I'm ready to rock
I'm ready to rock, rock, rock, rock
In a country kinda way

"Why'd I give my love away
Why'd I call out the unspoken
Why'd I change what seemed alright
To bring my love out in the open
When I socked it away for years
I guess I'd made a barricade
And hung my key by the door
So that's what secrets are for
There's a storm coming down in the morning
With a freezing rain to add to our worries
And I won't speak of these things anymore
I'll just bury them down in drifts of snow
Where spring may come to see them grow
There's a storm coming down from Virginia
And a woman's heart that yearns for the sun
And I won't speak of these things anymore
I'll just bury them down under drifts of snow
Where spring may come to see them grow"
"I know who makes my shoes
Yeah I know who makes my shoes
You may think this information
Something you can't use
But I know who makes my shoes
And I know who grows my food
Yeah, I know who grows my food
I went down to the fields
To make sure we were introduced
Now I know who grows my food
What goes out must still come round
And there's so much to be found
So I know who makes the clothes I wear
Yeah I know who makes the clothes I wear
I used to buy them blindly
And I didn't even care
But now I know who make the clothes I wear
And I know who grows my food
And I know it's a small, small world
When someone's being used
So I know who makes my shoes..."
"Half mile hill 8 years old,
standing on top, with the world below,
Me and my dad, talking man to man,
suitcase packed,he was moving out,
says no ones fault , but I had my doubts,
and I have em still up on half mile hill,
you can see the ball fields,
watch the cars go round the courthouse,
see the sun go down where the streetlamps glow,
on those checkerboard rows,
wishing I could fly, like a cut string kite,
tapping on the floor of heaven,is anybody listening,
half mile hill 17,
telling the summer, and jim beam,
kicking beer cans off the side, one last time,
she was wildcat tuff I was scarecrow thin,
we were thick as thieves til the bitter end,
trying to make time stand still,on half mile hill,
you could see the ball fields,
watch the cars go round the courthouse,
see the sun go down where the streetlamps glow,
on those checkerboard rows,
wishing I could fly, like a cut string kite,
tapping on the floor of heaven, is anybody listening,
hey all you lovers and leavers,
stuck in between us,
loners and stoners,
old drunks and dreamers,
rumbling and stumbling,
always looking for something,
past that no trespassing sign,
you can see the ball fields,
watch the cars go round the courthouse,
see the sun go down where the streetlamps glow,
on those checkerboard rows,
wishing I could fly, like a cut string kite,
tapping on the floor of heaven, tapping on the floor of heaven,
is anybody listening, (in background) (is anybody listening),
up on half mile hill,
is anybody listening,(in background) (is anybody listening)."

When your eyes meet mine my heart beats out of time
And I burn with desire through and through
I can't help myself I can't see no one else cause my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you my eyes can only see you
Your face is always in view for my eyes can only see you
I want you so much and I long for your touch and your eyes tell me you want me
too
Oh it may not be right but I'm too weak to fight and my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you...
And my eyes can only see you"
"Somewhere between me and you
I love you so much I can't let you go and sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine there's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky somewhere between me and you
[ piano ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine there's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile and I'm left in the middle again
Somewhere between..."
"All of my life, I've looked for love, but somethin inside said it wasn't enough. Then there was you, and that's when i knew it was true. And it feels so right, with you here tonight, with all of my heart my soul and my mind would you put you're hand in mine!
chorus

"I am a man of conviction, I shattered these walls
Spent my life in a bottle, cut myself had to crawl
Stared down a barrel of a 45, dared the man on the other side
To have the guts to pull the trigger
I am a man of conviction
CHORUS
Convicted of loving one girl too much
Sentenced to live without her touch
Convicted of somehow forgetting God
Sentenced to life of hell on earth
And they aint coming back, Ive never known either to lie
It wasnt my intention, I am a man of conviction
A promise made a promise broken, Ive left nothing uncertain
I took the lower road, my back bent to carry my load
I broke hearts along the way, made a fool of myself most days
It wasnt my intention, but I am a man of conviction
CHORUS x2
No dont you cry for me, Ive made this bed where I lie
It wasnt my intention, I am a man of conviction
Its too late for intervention, I am a man of conviction"
"I know you've been down just as far as a good man can go.
And the hurtin's come easy but the healin's been slow.
But you're on your way to recovery and you're not alone.
'Cause Nancy sure loves you and she's gonna take care of ol' Jones.
[Chorus]
So cry on my shoulder and let's both get over the bad.
Let's chalk it up to just one more bad memory we have.
Friendship's the one thing that keeps love from driving us mad.
So cry on my shoulder, we're the best friends that we ever had.
I heard you left Haggard, I knew by the words in his song.
And you're wondering if you're right sittin' at home all alone.
But I know you still love him 'cause you're always there when he calls.
And always remember that you're his favorite memory of all.
[Chorus]
So cry on my shoulder and let's both get over the bad.
Let's chalk it up to just one more bad memory we have.
Friendship's the one thing that keeps love from driving us mad.
So cry on my shoulder, we're the best friends that we ever had..."
"Cold Fort Worth beer just ain't no good for jealous
I tried it night after night
You're in someone else's arms in Dallas
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?
Darlin', while you're busy burnin' bridges,
Burn one for me when you get time
'Cause good memories don't fade so easy
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?
You left me here to be with him in Dallas
And I know it hurt you at the time
I wonder now if it makes a difference
Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind?"
"Come here my love
Right beside me
Oh I yearn for you to be
Endlessly burning near me
The everlasting seconds of twilight
Surround us briefly
And the rift between two worlds
Increases dangerously
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes
You're far away
Then my night becomes your day
It's getting harder to recall
If we're still leading the same fight
Sometimes I wonder
Where are you
My intuition varies
Am I or am I not alone
You just say you're always with me
But how can I stop the fantasy
When it's on ?
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes
Who could think that you could save me with just a glimpse
So deeply carved in my mind
(and it begs the question)
What about you
Or is it only me ?
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes
Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes"
"There's no more waiting
Holding out for love
You are my Godsend
That I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you
What is this feeling
I've never known before
That I should dare to
Swear to surrender ever more
That's what I came here for
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways
Heaven knows
When you're around
Baby I have foundI get lost
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you"
"I'm waiting to hear you call me darling
I'm waiting to hear you call me dear
You know that I have always loved you
Don't make me lonely all these years
Two years ago when I first met you
You smiled at me and looked so sweet
You made me think you cared about me
But you never said that you loved me
Oh maybe I took too much for granted
To think you'd ever love me
Please oh please don't try to fool me
'Cause all you'd cause is misery"
"Girl look at you right there with that wind in your hair
Like a dream in the sunset light
I couldn't love you anymore, I couldn't love you any less
I guess I'm doing something right
But girl you gotta promise me
That if you ever have to leave
Baby lie to me 'cause I couldn't stand the truth
And I couldn't bear the thought of losin' you
Baby lie to me, tell me everything's all right
And when I'm sound asleep, you can fade into the night
Girl, instead of sayin' goodbye
Just lie to me
Last night when I saw you in a dream, you were packing' your things
And baby it all seemed so real
You came to tell me you were gone, my life had ended like a song
Felt as bad as I could feel
So if there ever comes a day
That you wanna walk away
Baby lie to me 'cause I couldn't stand the truth
And I couldn't bear the thought of losin' you
Baby lie to me, tell me everything's all right
And when I'm sound asleep, you can fade into the night
Girl, instead of sayin' goodbye
Just lie to me"
"(He's going home yes he's going back)
I'm going home to the arms of my hometown sweetheart
Cause she means the world to me
I have missed her cherry lips cherry smile missed her kiss all the while
Been as lonesome as can be
No other girl incompare to my hometown sweetheart
Hand to toe she suits me fine
I'm just a hometown boy who'll be full of joy when I'll see
That hometown sweetheart of mine
(He's going home to the arms of his hometown sweetheart)
Cause she means the world to me
(He misses her honey lips honey smile misses her kisses all the while)
Been as lonesome as can be"
"I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby
Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
I wasted so much precious time baby
I see you with your friends
Wearing a smile again
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me
Girl I shoulda known it
I couldn't last a moment without you
Thought I could quit you
But I still miss your love
What was I thinking
Thinking that I could still
Walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night"
"There goes my reason for living there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession there goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living
There goes my everything"
"I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone"
"You always get dolled up for your party
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year
Cause you always forget that you're so small
You can't take all that alcohol
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before
Your headaches and your fussin' and cussin' the sun
The makeup you had on your face
Is now all over your pillow case
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
So baby don't you ever doubt
When father time starts drawing out
Those lines around your eyes
Cause you'll always be
You'll always be
Beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
Always be
Always be beautiful
To me"
"Send me the pillow that you dream on.
Don't you know that I still care for you?
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
Each night while I'm sleeping oh, so lonely,
I'll share your love in dreams that once were true.
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
I've waited so long for you to write me,
But just a memory's all that's left of you.
Send me the pillow that you dream on,
So darling, I can dream on it, too.
So darling, I can dream on it, too."
"Well living in the city puts a lock on your door
Oh yeah uh huh huh
And you can't appreciate little things no more
Oh yeah uh huh huh
I can be Jack and you can be Jill
We can build a house up on top of the hill
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Say goodbye to the smog
Say goodbye to the queues
Oh yeah uh huh huh
It's been two long years and I've paid my dues
Oh yeah uh huh huh
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Whoa whoa ho hey hey Beating around the bush
Head up to the mountains on a long highway
Living in the city really bothers me
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush
Gonna get a big farm with a real nice view
Oh yeah uh huh huh
Get a horse get a dog and some chickens too
Oh yeah uh huh huh
When I get to thinking that I'm out of touch
I also get to thinking I ain't missing much
Have a ball do it all
Beating around the bush"
"Tell them about me
Tell them everything
After I'm gone, after I'm gone
Make it exciting, let them know I was fun
And tell the story like a beautiful dream
Oh the dress I wore was a fine silk crepe cream
And ooh, remember me
And ooh, remember me well
Oh the dances in that old Texas barn
Papa Sam was handsome
To the ladies he shone
I stood outside smoking
I was elegant and young
If not for that fine evening
None of you souls would be around
And ooh, remember me
And ooh, remember me well
Oh you're a wild and beautiful thing
The gods are crying when they hear you sing
Whatever happens, I'll be right here
After all your tears, after all your tears
But tell them about me,
Tell them everything
After I'm gone
After I'm gone"
"I was just standing
Alone in this room
Surrounded by memories
We stopped making too soon
I was just standing
I was just standing
Alone in this room
Alone in this room
I was just thinking
All to myself
How I still want you
And nobody else
I was just thinking
I was just thinking
All to myself
All to myself
In this darkness I move slowly
Always struggling to be free
But I still hear your voice
And everywhere I see the choice
That's made such a fool of me
I was just wondering
If there was a way
To bring you back to me
Maybe things I could say
I was just wondering
I was just wondering
If there was a way"
"Talk about life, talk about death
Talk about catching every breath
Talk about when, and talk about why!
Talk about do, and talk about don't
Talk about will and talk about won't
Talk about the sweet... bye and bye
[Chorus:]
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!
Talk about right, and talk about wrong
Talk about trying to get along
Talk about the way it all would be.
Talk about now, and talk about then
Talk about everywhere you've been
Talk about being free.
[Chorus x2:]
Well, talk is cheap and times are wasting
Get busy living or at least die trying
Wine is for tasting, roads for taking
Talk is cheap and times are wasting!"
"It was a beautiful sunny morning, so we went for a drive,
Hiked up in the mountains, and we lost track of time.
A kissin' and a huggin', never saw the sun go down,
I said ""Baby we're lost"", and she proceeded to freak out,
So I said,
Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
And that coyote howls, and the grizzly bear he growls.
I can get you through the night, oh yes I can,
I'm a mountain man.
I gave her a little hug, I said ""There's no need to cry"",
I used to be a beaver scout all I need is this Buck knife.
I can carve a hook, pull fish from a brook and I bang on with a gun,
Except tonight I don't really have one, and well, that's half the fun.
Awe you know I'm only kiddin' hun.
Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I know you're a city girl, but if you had to you could eat a squirrel.
Yeah I'd cook him up just right, you know I can.
I'm a mountain man.
We could pick berries in the moonlight,
'Cause I know which ones to eat.
How to recognize poison ivy,
Should you go lookin' for leaves.
Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I can bugle an elk, I can rattle a deer, I can grow you a big ol' bushy beard,
And live up here all year and never go back.
Yeah I'm a mountain man.
A man with a plan.
You're in good hands.
Yeah, I'm your mountain man.
Awe don't cry honey, It's all gonna' be alright."
"You and I gunna make a brand new start
Drag all we own out to the front yard
Make a big sign ""Everything is free""
that's the last this town'll see of you and me
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
Got all our cash stashed in a coffee can
Sleep in the backseat of this old sedan
Just like a bullet screamin' down the road
Straight into the heart of the great unknown
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
[instrumental]
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna find ourselves down that long highway
Hang on Annabelle
We gunna ride like hell, down that long highway
It's a long highway
such a long highway"
"[Chorus]
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me
The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains
[Chorus]
I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me"
"(1)John Wesley Harding shot a man for snoring, killed him in the bed right where he lay,
Took a snort of whisky and went back to his sleepin, Rode out before they found him the next day,
(2)Now the brothers Frank and Jesse, No-one could be more fearsome,
They robbed the trains and rode in the outlaw gangs,
The civil war was over but still they fought for Dixie,
And legend has their last name to be James.
Chorus
Livin in the west must have been the best, Must have been the greatest time of all.
Me I lived in the east and I was bored to say the least
But I never saw those sons of guns in bar-rooms starting brawls
(3)Little William Bonney, Billy the Kid they called him, Had to use a six-gun to survive,
He bit the dust at twenty-one but he left a reputation, A notch for every year he was alive
Chorus
(4)Now the frontier days are over for William Frank and Jesse, And a thousand other bad guys of their day,
But they still live on in stories and I hope they live forever,And to sum it up here is all that I want to say (Chorus)"
"Some days I seem so far away from where I want to be
And the things that I've accomplished seem so small
When I'm weary of the struggle and I feel I can't go
You love me through it all
Your love gives me a balance when I'm standing on the edge
You keep me going when my dreams have stalled
And you're always building bridges even when I'm building walls
You love me through it all
Sometimes I come home bragging bout the things I've done that day
Like a thing that I'm on top and cannot fall
And when I'm high on my successes thinking only of myself
You love me through it all
Through it all you're there to comfort me you keep my feet on solid ground
I know that I can make it as long as you're around
Your love gives me a balance"
"Some people have it, some people don't
Some people never will
Sometimes it's hard to know when you've got it
Sometimes it's perfectly clear
Well I know it's out there I've seen it happen
I know the way it should feel
Cause there's no mistakin'
That good kind of achin'
Of a once in a lifetime love
Once in a lifetime love
A love like we've all dreamed of
It may go disguised or right before your eyes
A once in a lifetime love
So if you think you've got it
If you feel it inside you
Don't let it slip away
Cause you may not ever find what you never
Thought you'd have anyway
And if you've always had it and just realized
You know how lucky you are
To wake up beside what some never find
A once in a lifetime love
Once in a lifetime love
A love like we've all dreamed of
It may go disguised or right before your eyes
A once in a lifetime love
It may go disguised or right before you eyes
A once in a lifetime love"
"There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein; and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains.
The dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day;
and there may I, though vile as he,
wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
wash all my sins away;
and there may, I though vile as he,
wash all my sins way."
"It sure gets lonely alone no one to cry to alone
Time sure goes slower since you're gone don't keep me lonely too long
I need to hold you in my arms and hear you say you need me
Don't let me live on dreams alone don't keep me lonely too long
Mem'ries are bad for one so lonely
My tortured heart cries out because it loves and wants you only
Yes I'm too lonely alone afraid I can't stand alone
Without your love I can't go on don't keep me lonely too long"
"Well you're my friend
(It's what you told me)
And can you see
(What's inside of me)
Many times
We've been out drinking
And many times
We've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got
Well you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live I won't let go
But can you see it's opposition
Comes a-rising up sometimes
That it's dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And did you know how much I love you
Is a hope that somehow you you
Can save me from this darkness
Well I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
That we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see
Oh no I see a darkness
Oh no I see a darkness
Oh no I see a darkness
Oh no I see a darkness
And did you know how much I love you
Is a hope that somehow you you
Can save me from this darkness"
"Sad eyes, sad eyes
Where're you going with that confidence?
Sad eyes, sad eyes
Where're you going with that confidence?
I'm going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide
I'm going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide
Still water, laying over
Still water, laying over
Still water, laying over
Caledonia river oh, so wide
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where're you going with the devil in hand?
I'm going to build the bridges high
For working money, for working money
I'm going to climb the bridges high
Caledonia brother far away
Still water, I'm laying over
Still water, lay my body down over
Still water, laying over
Caledonia river far away
Sad eyes in the weary night
Have you seen your brother,
Have you seen your brother?
Waiting by the river Grand
Caledonia river oh, so wide
Going to where the rain falls
Look for my brother,
Look for my brother
Going to where the rain falls
Caledonia river far away
Still water, laying over
Still water, lay my body down
Still water, laying over
Caledonia river far away"
"You wake up in the morning and clear your head
You sometimes think you'd be better off dead
You drive to work in a beat up car
You know where you're going but you don't know where you are
You might think you could be happy someday
but you don't know how to look the other way...
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day
You work a crap job, you don't know why
You follow your orders, you never blink an eye
You listen to them scream and you listen to them yell
You watch them create your own little private hell
You might think you could be happy someday
But you don't know how to look the other way
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day
You go to bed, but you cannot sleep
You wonder how you're gonna make it through the week
You finally doze off, you fall into a dream
You are the puppet who wants to cut its strings
What do you see
When the sun don't shine and you cannot find your way
What do you see
When the rain falls down onto the ground each day"
"Black eyed man he took the blame
For the poisoning of the well
They found this shoes by the pulley
They found his fingerprints all over the pail
Black eyed man I'm warning you
The people around here
Will not be fooled by a simple line or two
Yes your honor I do solemnly swear
That I saw him late last night,
Dancing barefoot, bathed in light
And reaching for every star in sight
Yes I did go to him,
But completely against my will
And yes he did things to me
Things of which I dream of still
Black eyed man I'm warning you
What I say is what you'll do
To hell with love and truth
I always meant to say I'm sorry
For all the things I said and did
'Sorry,' I feel better now, do you?
But you promised me the sky
And fell short a star or two
What else did you expect me to do?
Black eyed man he took the blame
For the poisoning of the well
They found his shoes by the pulley
They found his fingerprints all over the pail
With a noose around his neck,
Cicadas trilling everywhere,
He says to the people gathered round him,
'it ain't the water that's not right around here'
Black eyed man I'm thirsty dear
Be a love and bring some water here
Drawn fresh from the well"
"It Starts:
The sun comes up, the sun goes down,
the hands on the clock go round and round,
you just get up and it's time to lay down !
life gets teejus don't it?"
"Love the runs away fro me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keep on bothering me
Chains that just won't set me free
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my twp empty arms
Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories time can not erase
Then I awake and find you gone
And I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two open arms
That lonesome feeling all the time
Knowing you can not be mine
Dreams that haunt me in my sleep
Vows that we could never keep
Too far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two open arms"
"Casanova broke ya
Just like china
He was smooth as southern Blue Bell Cream
?Cept he never meant to share that diamond ring
So you take up to the roof-top, pining
Aim to touch the moon a' golden white
Lord, the air is damp, the stars are teary eyed
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
From the ballroom you can hear them laughing
Pretty maidens and your own Don Jaun
And ya tell yourself
They?ll miss you when you?re gone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Cross yourself, by Jesus
Now your head is all a blur
Questions don?t come easier
Answers, they get longer
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone
Here?s a little secret, love
Everybody comes undone
Here?s a dirty secret Darlin?
Everyone"
"She captured both Rock and Bird tied
One to the leg of the other kept them as prisoners
Until they knew who was master
Then she threw them to the sky Bird
With unbarred wings disappeared Rock
With weighted heart returned
And rock became her anchor
And bird became her dream
Now she stands on the forest floor
Among the pines and towering firs
Rock still firm beneath her feet
Bird perched high above her singing songs of love's betrayal
'I offered you my endless skies you countered with hoods and chains
This song I sing will be the last to be inspired by your memory'"
"[ Both ]
We said our goodbyes long ago never thinking we'd miss each other so
All the memories we can't leave behind oh we must have been out of our minds
[ Skeeter ]
I've thought I loved another not you
[ Bobby ]
Oh how foolish I've thought the same too
[ Both ]
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds oh we must have been out of our minds
[ piano ]
[ Bobby ]
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known
[ Skeeter ]
We'll reap together all the wild seeds we've sowed
[ Both ]
Surely they can forgive us and find that we must have been out of our minds
[ Skeeter ]
Yes I've thought I loved another...
Yes we must have been out of our minds"
"Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
When I'm broke an' I got no where to go
Been hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Hangin' around with a good time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime
Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary in blues everywhere I see
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me
Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleepin', my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride"
"I saw her for the first time when the snow was falling down
And Lord she was the cutest thing I've ever seen
Great big green eyes a flashin' ruby lips a smilin'
Well my heart went pitter patter and I knew it was gonna shatter
If I couldn't make that little gal my own
You can sing about your sweet Joly Blon
You can sing about them pretty gals down in Tennessee
You can sing your song about that Yellow Rose of Texas
But the one by the Powder River that runs through old Kaycee
That Wyoming girls the only one for me
I've been around this big country and I've seen a lot of women in my time
Well there ain't none sweeter and there ain't none better
Than this little gal I call mine and I thank you Lord for making her my wife
You can sing about..."
"What makes two hearts that beat as one
Until the heart trades love for fun?
What makes the one I love untrue?
What makes me love you like I do?
What makes the stars up in the sky
Seem lost from dark clouds drifting by?
What makes them tear my dreams in two?
What makes me love you like I do?
What makes a heart so sick and sore?
What makes a heart keep yearning for
A heart that's gone to love anew?
What makes me love you like I do?
I can't explain this heart of mine
This foolish love it made was blind
I'd ended all if I just knew
What makes me love you like I do?"
"Damn girl, I didn't know you'd be here
Been a while, it's sure good to see you
Rollin' in here, ready to rock
Standin' there sippin' that shiner bock
We're pickin' up right where we left off last time
I'll drop a quarter in that jukebox
If you'll dance the way you know I like
In and out of that neon light
And if I kiss you up against the wall, it ain't my fault
Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
You'll sing along like I'm the only one that's listening
You lit the fuse, now you've got all of my attention
Just let me know when you're ready to leave
Say the word we'll get on this thing
In stereo, little rodeo, baby here we go
Cause I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
I can't turn it off, turn it off, turn it off the way you turn it
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on, girl I'll admit right now
I'm just about halfway gone, baby you can do no wrong
And I can't turn it off the way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
The way you turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
The way you
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
The way you
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on"
"In South Carolina, there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree, that we used to climb
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home Hickory Wind
I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm gettin' the feel of Hickory Wind
It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home Hickory Wind
Keeps callin' me home Hickory Wind"
"Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make each run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail
Blessed Saviour Thou must guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In Thy grace forever more
Blessed Savior Thou must guide
In Thy grace forever more"
"I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you
It's not like it was
When we fell in love
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Honey, let's get back to me and you
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you
Well honey, let's get on back to me and you"
"Sleepin' on the foldout thanks to me and my big mouth
Why did I do what I did
I shoulda known better than to lie
But it's too late and so tonight I'm
Sleepin' on the foldout sofa-bed

But I told her that I had to work
I never dreamed she'd get home so dang early
And she caught me cleanin' fish
Out on our back porch

I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me"

"Pulling in to my hometown
It all comes back to me
A million memories crashing down
It all comes back to me
Thought i'd left this place forever
I was chasing bigger dreams
But at the city limit sign
It all comes back to me
Thought i would set this world on fire
It all comes back to me
Now i'm driving in on four bald tires
It all comes back to me
Everyone i meet remembers
Just who i used to be
The right and wrong
It all comes back to me
Bridge
Every road i've travelled, every dead end street
What i've lost and what i've gained
Every dream that's died, every tear i've cried
I've only got myself to blame
Looks like what goes around comes back around
It took some time but i'm finally learning how
It all comes back to me
Instrumental
To change my life and start again
It all comes back to me
To find the place where i fit in
It all comes back to me
With a little hope and courage
I'll have the strength i need
Whatever lies ahead
It all comes back to me"
"You gotta walk that lonesome valley you gotta go all by yourself
No one else can walk it for you you gotta walk all by yourself
My mama said when she was dying just before she passed away
Said come here son sit down beside me you better listen to your mama's say
That you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
Now many men has walked that valley they had to walk all by theirselves
Cause no one else could walk it for them so you gotta walk all by yourself
Yes you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
You must go and stand your trials boy and you gotta stand all by yourself
Cause no one else can stand them for you you gotta stand all by yourself
Yes you gotta walk that lonesome valley...
Yes you gotta go all by yourself"

You walked up yesterday and you told me you were leavin'
Left a note sayin' momma won't be back
But you'll come back and I've got news for you dear
You won't have a home and that's a fact
Don't you come back on your knees asking my forgiveness
Pack your bags and move on down the line
Don't you roll them eyes at me, tellin' me your sorry
It's too late babe, and it won't work this time
I've always been around, lord when you needed someone
I played the role 'til I knew each line by heart
But now it's time to change, won't you find another playmate
Someone who'll be glad to play the part
Don't you come back on your knees asking my forgiveness
Pack your bags and move on down the line
Don't you roll them eyes at me, tellin' me your sorry
It's too late babe, and it won't work this time
Don't you come back on your knees asking my forgiveness
Pack your bags and move on down the line
Don't you roll them eyes at me, tellin' me your sorry
It's too late babe, and it won't work this time"
"I've been fighting with these sheets again can't make myself lie still
My pillowcase is soaking wet and yet I feel a chill
It takes all I can do these days to just survive the nights
[Chorus]
It gets crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind
When a man can't shake a memory he runs hot and cold and blind
He hates he then he loves her then he hates her one more time
Your love has such a grip on me it chokes me like a vine
Oh it's crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind
I've been phoning you since eight o'clock it's almost four a.m.
My mind keeps painting pictures of you out loving him
I just crushed a Dixie cup for running out of wine
It gets crazy when a man can get a woman off his mind
[Chorus]
Drives him crazy when a man can't get his woman off his mind
When a man can't shake"
"Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim
If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice
You'd better watch your step it's hard to read the signs
And some times you have to lose before you can find
They say, ""All in love is fair""
You got to give for someone to care
And it can be so nice but love is thin ice
Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim
If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice
You'd better stick to higher ground if you don't want to cry
But if you don't take a chance you'll never learn how to fly
One day you're walkin' on air
Next thing you know your heart needs repair
But that's just the price 'cause love is thin ice
Love is thin ice
It's so easy to fall right in
Love is thin ice
So you better know how to swim
If you're not ready for fallin'
Then you better be careful when love starts callin'
Take my advice
Love is thin ice
You better take my advice
Love is thin ice"
"Oh jealous me and careless you
The odds were just too great
I couldn't stand those lonely nights
You made me sit and wait
But I'd thought I'd seen the last of you
When you walked out of site
Instead I see you in my dreams each night
Oh the key's in the mailbox, come on in
I'm sitting here wishin' dear, I'd have your love again
And I'll never even ask you where you've been
The keys in the mailbox, come on in
Well I said I'd rather stay alone
Than share your company
I said don't come around at all
If you want more than me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that burns
And I'd gladly take you back on any terms"
"One comes of it
Love it, love it
Let go of it
Love comes from it
We're not of this world for long
Faith and promise keep me honest
When starvation falls upon us
Daylight told me he would be
Gone with cold words
Spoke among hers
Wretched in the tongue of their world
We're not of that world at all
We will never be
Wouldn't it be fine to stand
Behind the words we say in the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell in paradise
Right here on Earth
Keep it, use it
Build it, move it
Planes can touch our time will prove it
Watch us fly as loud we can
Let her heartbeat change what I am now
Wouldn't it be fine to stand
Behind the words we say
In the best of times
Oh, and you and I know all too well
About the hell in paradise
Right here on Earth"
"TWO TEARDROPS
(Bill Anderson - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she'd just gotten married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell by the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be life-long companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there callin' her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday there'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure for a moment of pain
And they drift on down and ride to the sea again
Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
Old man sittin' not ten feet away just lost his wife said to me
You've got brand new angel and I lost mine
I guess the Good Lord giveth and the Good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a tear drop from our face
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are part of the pleasure and part of the pain
Till they drift on down and ride to the sea again
Two teardrops floatin' down the river
Two teardrops floatin' down the river"
"MY LITTLE BUCKAROO
(M.K. Jerome - Jack Scoll)
'57 copyright control
Close your sleepy eyes my little Buckaroo
While the light of western skies is shining down on you
Don't you know it's time for bed another day is through
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo
Soon you're gonna ride the rails like grown up cowboys do
Now it's time that you were roundin' up a dream or two
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo mhm
Goodnight sleep tight don't you realize my little Buckaroo
It was from my little acorn that the oak tree grew
And remember Buffalo Bill was once a kid like you
So go to sleep my little Buckaroo mhm goodnight sleep tight"
"When I'm down in the valley and all that I can see
Is the mountain there before me as big as it can be
I remember in the Bible I can almost hear 'em say
He's work of conciliation that give me strenght today
You can move that mountain if you just believe
You can move that mountain down into the sea
You can move that mountain if you just believe
You can move that mountain try and you'll see
Then I read a little further and see just what he'd said
And I read about the leper how he raised the dead
But I finally found the trouble would mean the most to me
I read about the Master's seed that grew into the tree
You can move that mountain...
When I feel the spirit of the Lord sweeten over me
As he whispers softly in my ear speaking unto me
Now when you get this courage things get in your way
Just listen to this message before you start to pray
If you have a little bit --- like that mustard seed
You can say I'm to that mountain falling to the sea
You can move that mountain...
You can move that mountain..."
"We made Oklahoma a little after three
Randy, his brother Bob, and my old GFC
We had some moonshine whiskey and some of Bob's homegrown
We were so messed up we didn't know if we were drunk or stoned
Randy was a sad sack - tall, kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazier than hell
We been kicked out of high school several years ago
For kicking over port-o-cans at the 4-H rodeo
Since they done the little dance right outside the law
Popped twice in Oklahoma and once in Arkansas
And I don't know what possessed me to want to tag along
'Cause I was raised a Christian, and I knew right from wrong
[Chorus]
Right or wrong, black or white
Cross the line, you're gonna pay
Into the dawn before the light
Live or die by shades of gray
We stole two Charolais heifers
From Randy's sweetheart's pa
And sold them at the livestock sale outside of Wichita
We got nine hundred dollars and never did suspect
The world of hurt we'd be in once we cashed that check
Next day we heard the story on the local radio
And made our plans that very night to go to Mexico
And I swear we would've made it if it wasn't for the shine
I got sick about the time we crossed that Kansas line
[Chorus]
I was lying in the bar ditch, praying I would die
When a light came on above us
And a voice called from the sky
A half dozen unmarked cars came screeching to a halt
They grabbed Bob, he started screaming that it was my fault
There were men and dogs and helicopters flying all around
They had the brothers on the pickup hood
And me on the ground
Then Bob flew all to pieces, but Randy - he held tight
When a black man in a suit and tie stepped into the light
He told his men to turn us loose
And they put down their guns
He said these are just some sorry kids
They ain't the ones
[Chorus]
They left us by the roadside downhearted and alone
Randy got behind the wheel, said, ""Boys, I'm going home.""
So we turned 'round and faced our fate, hung over but alive
On that morning Oklahoma, late April ninety-five"
"She locked her fingers, and bowed her head,
She said I'm late, and I'm really scared,
She said you can go, but I hope you stay,
I'm gonna keep it, either way
In my daddy's El Camino,
In her driveway in the rain,
Starrin' through that windshield I could see my future change,
And my heart hit like a hammer,
And my thoughts were runnin' wild,
Any fool can make a baby, but it takes a man, to raise a child.
I laid my head, down on the wheel,
She said I know, I know, it don't seem real,
She closed her eyes, but the tears flowed through,
She said don't hate me, for lovin' you
In my daddy's El Camino,
In her driveway in the rain,
Starrin' through that windshield I could see my future change,
And my heart hit like a hammer,
And my thoughts were runnin' wild,
Any fool can make a baby, but it takes a man, to raise a child.
Oh I could not reassure her,
I couldn't say what I had planned,
Couldn't put three words together,
So I just, took her hand
In my daddy's El Camino,
In her driveway in the rain,
Starrin' through that windshield I could see my future change,
And my heart hit like a hammer,
And my thoughts were runnin' wild,
Any fool can make a baby, but it takes a man, to raise a child."
"You may be wealthy with more than your share
You may be able to go anywhere
You may have a kingdom and sit on a throne
But you'll still be lonely if you live alone
You may follow the bright lights with a smile on your face
You may travel this whole world and not get any place
A man needs a woman to stick by his side
One who who'll be faithful and much out of his pride
Until you'll find her all the dreams you have known
Will never come true while you live alone
Until you'll find her"
"I remember the day we had nothing to do
So we went down to the city zoo
Just to kill an hour or two
Out in the good sunshine
We had so much fun
We were glad that we came
Feed all the animals
And gave each a name
Didn't even mind when it started to rain
We had a real good time
Now that its over and your far away
I miss you more with each passin day
And all my friends sympathize and say
You'll for get in time
Yes you will
Give yourself a little time
But it's already been over a year
Just in case you interested
You might like to hear
How everyone is doing down at the city zoo with out you
Well the monkey forgot you
The hippo forgot you
And so did the kangaroo
But me and the elephant
We still remember you
Me and the elephant will never forget you
Well I called down an old friend
Trusted and true
Sought his advice as to what I should do
He said everything that reminds me of you
Would all have to go
So I burned all of your pictures
Except two or three
The one by my bed
And the one on my TV
And the one that I always carry with me everywhere I go
And today was so nice
And since I was in town
I thought I'd take the opportunity to go down
And see how everyone is down at the city zoo
And what's new
Well the rhino forgot you
The zebra forgot you
The polar bear and the tiger too
But me and the elephant we still remember you
Me and the elephant will never forget you"
"I'm traveling down this lonesome road, oh, how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you, sweetheart, and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I remember dear, not long ago, you said you'd be my own
I never thought you'd go away and leave me all alone
The kind of love you had for me, I find sweetheart, grows cold
For now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
I'm traveling down this lonesome road, oh, how I hate to go
The wind and storms are raging high and it's awful cold
My mind drifts back to you, sweetheart, and I love you so
Now you've gone and left me here to travel this lonesome road
All I do is roam around and look for you, my dear
I know I'll search ten thousand miles, oh, how I need you, dear
You broke my heart, you left me here, now I'm growing old
Why did you go and leave me here to travel this lonesome road?"
"I work a forty hour week and I earn my keep
And I try to walk proud and tall
I keep my nose to the grind, I don't get behind
And I don't back up at all
Well my neck's a little red, my collar's blue
I sip a little coffee and I drink a little booze
[Chorus]
Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
Cause I'm an all American country boy
I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
I'm hooked on TV, Rolaids and B.C.'s
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change
[Chorus]
Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father time can slow you down
I'm still doin' all I used to do
It just takes a little longer now
[Chorus]
I'm just a country boy
A good ol' country boy"
"She caught me on the back porch once again
In the middle of a fight we both knew I couldn't win
Then she came up from behind and took my glass
And she said, hold me instead and soon the urge will pass
And then she whispered, I'm forever by your side
And together we can beat this thing one step at a time
And then she kissed me and it moved me
She took away the fear and pain
And gave something new to soothe me
She said she needs me and she loves me
And with a woman as strong as that
Who needs the whiskey
I kept my weakness hidden for so long
But she gave me the strength to admit I'd been wrong
And when I asked her why she stood right by my side
She said you'd do the same for me with tears in her eyes
And then she wrapped her arms around me and held me close
And said if ever you need something strong, well baby
Just let me know
And then she kissed me and it moved me
She took away the fear and pain
And gave something new to soothe me
She said she needs me and she loves me
And with a woman as strong as that
Who needs the whiskey
She says she loves me and she'd never leave me
And with a woman as strong as that
With a woman as strong as that
Well who needs the whiskey
I'm free
Who needs the whiskey"
"I'm skipping across the stars
Hopping from moon to moon
Higher than a kite's been before
Made my way to Mars
Venus and Neptune
If I was scared of heights
I ain't no more
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
A lot of astronauts have left the planet earth
But they use rocketships to kiss the sky
I don't have what they got
But I sail the universe
Everytime your lips are kissing mine
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
Back when I was green
You could find me chooglin' smoke
But when I got off I never left the ground
Now you can't find me
Unless you have a telescope
And I don't want to ever come back down
Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high
I'm high"
"It's a long way down from riches to rags but if you can wear a cotton dress with pride
Then come on down from riches to rags if a poor man's love can keep you satisfied
Before you take my hand and tell your other man goodbye
Make sure you want to give up all the things that he can't buy
If you want my love there's no turning back it's a long way down from riches to rags
[ steel - guitar ]
Oh before you take my hand...
It's a long way down from riches to rags"
"Every time I turn the radio on some cat's singin' a happy song
About a woman who wakes him up every morning and loves him
Scrambles his eggs and unscrambles his life butters his toast with a golden knife
Bears his kids and nearly bout all of his burdens
And I just sit there starin' at the wall wonderin' how I missed it all
I've been out half of the night and I'm hung over
Nobody woke me rubbin' my feet just the sound of a jackhammer out in the street
And this ole room ain't exactly a field of clover
Am I the only tavern-hoppin' beer-can-poppin' fool left in the world
Am I the only sad-and-lonely meek-weak-freak without a girl
No one to love and make me happy call me baby or call me pappy
Am I the only low-and-lonely woman-needin' jukebox-feedin'
Sufferin' son of a gun left in the world
[ guitar - steel ]
Every time I turn the radio on some cat's singin' a happy song
About the woman who serves him love on a silver platter
Makes his coffee sweet and warm holds him in her lovin' arms
I look in the mirror and I wonder what's the matter
Am I the only tavern-hoppin'..."
"I tried to give up on love
'Cause I knew I should
No matter how hard I tried
It didn't do me no good
I just stopped cold turkey
What else could I do
There were pieces of my heart all over town
And I was runnin' out of blue
I was feelin' okay
When I got out of bed
But what I saw outside my window
Was like a kick in the head
My hands started shakin'
I felt the cold chills begin
When I saw that truck pull up
Now look who's movin' in
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
I tried to get a better look
So I sneaked downstairs
And just three steps from the bottom
I saw him standing there
Ain't it just my luck
He says he wants to be my friend
He set two glasses on the table
Now he's invitin' me in
And he lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
He lives twelve steps down
In the apartment below
He's got what it takes to tempt a woman
Body and soul
And if I fall I ain't got far to go
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
Slidin' around
I'm losin' ground
He lives twelve steps down
Twelve steps down"
"They kissed goodbye at the terminal gate
She said, ""You're gonna be late if you don't go""
He held her tight, said, ""I'll be alright
And I'll call you tonight to let you know""
He bought a postcard, on the front it just said Heaven
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach
Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise, it's summertime all year
And there's some folks we know, they say
Hello, I miss you so, wish you were here
She got a call that night, but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ma'am the plane went down
Our crews have searched the ground
No survivors found she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail that just said Heaven
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loves her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach
Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise, it's summertime all year
And there's some folks we know, they say
Hello, I miss you so, wish you were here
The weather's nice, in paradise, it's summertime all year
And all the folks we know, they say
Hello, I miss you so, wish you were here, wish you were here"
"I know your leaving is too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
through dry eyes I watched your plane
Fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain
The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke your name
Not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain
Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away
Just behind the darkest hour just before dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain"
"[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas is two gold front teeth
(What?)
Two gold front teeth
With a diamond in each
I'd be a G if I could have two front teeth
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas
It's Christmas
And I'm toothless
(Ho ho)
I got a cap in my grill that's ruthless
(Ho ho)
I need a dentist that's both a driller and a jeweler
(Ho ho)
I'm lookin' for a look that's just a little bit cooler
(Ho ho)
I don't want toys I don't want any money
(Ho ho)
I want my carats in my mouth of Bugs Bunny
(Ho ho)
This year the only thing on my list
Is two teeth to match the watch on my wrist
[Chorus]
When someone says ""Yo wazzup dog?""
I'll say: ""You know I'm doin my plug fizzle
(Right on)
A real OG like ODB
My record sales will triple.""
[Chorus]
I'd be like Pimp Dracula
The Spetacula
Cledus T. will be Stone Cold Makea
Here I go again with my funky alter ego
(Ho ho)
Making people laugh is the best gift I know
(Ho ho)
Better wrap it up put it underneath the tree
(Ho ho)
I want a million dollar smile like Master be
(Ho ho)
I'll keep them shinin' like the doves on my duly(sp?)
(Ho ho)
Santa Claus won't you please bring him to me
[Chorus: x2]
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas
That I'd wish you a funky Christmas"
"I was down in the valley way down in the valley when the Saviour heard my feeble cry
Now I'm back up on the mountain way up on the mountain
Drinking from the fountain that never will run dry
Well there was darkness all around me when my Saviour found me
Way down in the valley of despair
But when I told him all my troubles my joys and he doubled
Now I'm back up on the mountain rejoicing in his care
Well I was down in the valle
If it don't watch old Satan he'll get you in the valley
And hide you from the Saviour's guiding light
But he will stay behind you and he will never find you
Way up on ther mountain if you fight a good fight
Well I was down in the valley
Yes I was down in the valley
Well I said I was down in the valley"
"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
I remember Mother praying
Father too, on bended knee
The sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness, of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories fill my soul"
"Moonlight in a dew drop
Two miles to the ridge top
One hand on the wheel is probably
One more than I need
Bald tires in a dirt rut
Chauffeur us all the way up
We've been there enough
All we gotta do is turn the key
[Chorus]
Just like the back of your hand
I know my way around this land
Around every curve and bend
From your heart down to your soul
There ain't nothing I can't do
When it comes to loving you
It's like flying down these old back roads
I could do it with my eyes closed
We'll kill the motor when we get there
I'll pull the ribbon from your hair
We'll lay up on the hood and I can stare at you all night
And you'll say when we're over that hill
Are you gonna love me still
Well baby you know I will
It's just like riding a bike
[Chorus]
They can't tell us love is blind
Cause it brought us right where we are tonight
There ain't nothing I can't do
When it comes to loving you
It's like flying down these old back road
I could do it with my eyes closed
I could love you with my eyes closed
I could do it with my eyes closed"
"In the beautiful hills in the mists of Roane County
There's where I have roamed for many long years
There's where my heart's been tendin most ever
There's where the first step of misfortune I made
It's about thirty years when I courted and married
Armanda Gilbraith I'd soon call my wife
My brother he stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three month's later I'd taken Tom's life
I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in that county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next mornin'
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard
When the train pulled out poor Mother stood weepin'
And sister she sat all alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was ""Willy God bless you""
Was ""Willy God bless you God bless you goodbye""
In the scorching hot sand of the foundry I'm workin'
Toiling and working my poor life away
They'll measure my grave on the banks of old Cumberland
Just as soon as I finish the rest of my days
Poort Martha was grave, but Corey was better
There's better and worse, although you may see
Boys when you write home from this prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for me"
"Drove to the church
In my suit and tie
But I just couldn't bring myself
To go inside
So I sat alone
In my truck across the street
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes
By that long white limousine
I could just imagine
What was goin on in there
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass
And those flowers in her hair
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Those bells rang loud as thunder
As they opened up the doors
Now I don't have to wonder anymore
Laughin and a cryin'
Tossin that bouquet
And when you got in that limo
I drove off the other way
And I still don't know
Why things happened like they did
But I parked that old pickup
On that lonesome river bridge
I took your ring from my pocket
And then I held it one last time
Watched that diamond sparkle
I drew back and I let her fly
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Oh that old ring went under
And now it's gone for sure
And I don't have to wonder anymore
Well the angels sang like thunder
As I felt myself go under
Now I don't have to wonder anymore"
"Almost midnight
Another one drives by
Sounds like a V8
Listen to it fade away
It ain't her that's for sure
Just another night of
Chorus:
Watchin' headlights all night
Movin' 'cross the ceiling, prayin'
Slow down, turn now
I wish I was sleepin'
Instead of wonderin' where you are
Wide awake, countin' cars
There's nothin' like the sound
Of her wheels rollin' down
This old gravel driveway
Like she's done everyday
Comin' home girl, come on
I'm here goin' crazy
Repeat Chorus
I wonder if she's drivin' by
Goin' 'round and 'round in circles
Wide awake
Repeat Chorus
Oh, countin' cars
Countin' cars"
"While you study stars
During the night
Telescopic
During the night
Telescopic
And laughing out to the street
When they come from the bars
There in the night
Telescopic
And laughing out to the street"
"Just came up on the Midnight Special
Hey, how 'bout that
My car broke down in Texas
She stopped dead in her tracks
Just called to tell you that I need you
Just called to tell you how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
They took my money on the night train north
What a terrible thing
I gave my promise that I will be there with you
By Saturday night
I want to tell you that I need you
I need to tell you how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
You can't say much in a phone call, babe
You know how it is
I have to tell you one sure thing
Oh, won't you listen to this
I want to tell you that I love you, babe
I want to tell you just how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
Some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel"
"Keep the fire burning in your eyes
Pay attention to the open sky
You'll never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You're always dancing in and out of view
I must have thought you would always be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found
I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear
But I can't sing, I can't help listening
I can't help feeling stupid standing around
Crying is the easier down
'Cause I know that you would rather we'd be dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
No matter what fate throws in your way
Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
You'll never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
Just as easy it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive
But you'll never know"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
Chorus:
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
Repeat chorus
So may the best woman win"
"Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Wakin' up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
'Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end
But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasin' you
Though they have ever right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinkin' how I could have wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
Thou shalt not commit, it's written in the ten
The spirit's always willin', but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
And angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if lovin' you is wrong
I'm wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
My cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong"
"Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right
So scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losin' control, yeah, I'm all over the place
There's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Well, you started out with nothin'
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'
Slap you on the back and say, ""Please, please""
Tryin' to make some sense of it all
But I can see, it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawlin'
Slap you on the back and say, ""Please, please, please""
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs
There's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you"
"We were playin' out in Vegas when this lady pressed her way up to the stage
I forgot what I was singin' when she met me with her meet-me-later gaze
When she threw it on my mic stand, I figured they were probably double-D's
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
One time I met one of my heroes, and he made me feel real good that I was there
'Cause whatever he was smokin', man, it had me spinnin' circles in my chair
I fell asleep on his bus in Texas, but I woke up in Memphis, Tennessee
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
[Chorus]
But I got a woman
Let me tell you that she's somethin'
You won't catch me doin' nothin'
To ever make her wanna leave
She knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
When you're livin' on a bus, and you fill it up with a bunch of real good timin' boys
Mix in applause, and alcohol, and honky tonks, you know we're bound to make some noise
But this rake-and-ramblin' life helps me write the kind of songs I wanna sing
'Cause it makes for real good stories, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
[Chorus]
Yeah, she knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me"
"When she wakes up this morning and turns to kiss me
She'll find I let her sleep because we talked do late last night
She'll know kissed her face gently til my returning
And when she finds the rose on my pillow I know she'll smile
Her amazing love unending
Is so much more than I am worthy of
If the rose could speak my feelings
She'll know I cherish her amazing love
If I call her a little late she forgives me
A voice does not betray she spent another day alone
She softly thanks me for the rose and says I need you
And than I can feel her smiling on the phone
Her amazing love unending
Is so much more than I am worthy of
If the rose could speak my feelings
She'll know I cherish her amazing love"
"Well daisy duke peek-a-boo
I might've learned a thing or two
On a Friday night joyride
Out there on the county line
Drag racin' 'til the blue lights chase us
And we scattered like sparks from
A black cat fuse
Train bridge where we spray paint Skynyrd
And the gold flakes glimmered in the
Cinnamon booze
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
Alabama on the Alpine
Bust a cap on a deer sign
Little backseat butterfly
Home grown angel that'll get you high
That'll get you high
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
Yeah I see it clearer in the rearview mirror
Than I ever did lookin' out over the hood
Yeah man, we had some damn good times
And I sure hope everybody's doin' good
We were livin' every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were runnin' all the caution lights
We were learnin' to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was somethin' to burn, we were burnin' it
Anything with a curve, we were turnin' it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
The hell raisin' heat of the summer
The hell raisin' heat of the summer"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"
"Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
Tell me why you're weeping
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
When you should be sleeping
What secret are you keeping
Jessye' Lisabeth, pray tell
What could cause such bitter tears
What lesson has life taught you
Hear me sweet and precious one
Look what I have brought you
Here's a star I caught you
For my lady fair star
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
What can I do for you
Pray tell, Jessye' Lisabeth
Fair maiden I employ you
Oh how I adore you
Your humble servant I remain

"Where are you
Where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me
Where are you
Where's my heart
Where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted
Where are you
When we said good-bye love
What had we to gain
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain
All life through
Must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending
Where are you
When we said good-bye love
What had we to gain
When I gave you my love
Was it all in vain
All life through
Must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending
Where are you
Where are you"
"That was a tough goodbye
And what tore me down was watchin' her tryin' not to cry
She asked me to stay and for a minute I thought I might
Yeah, that was a tough goodbye
That was a long night
Full of lookin' back and wonderin' what it might've been like
Must've drove her memory across at least ten state lines
Yeah, that was a long, long night
And I'm not quite ready yet
To settle down or even let
Someone get a hold of me
'Cause I'm not done being free
I still have a few roads
To travel down and Lord knows
I got way too close that time
That was a tough goodbye
That was a hurtin' kind
Not the so long after awhile, see ya soon, some other time
Where I just walk away and everybody's fine
No, that was a hurtin' kind
And I'm not quite ready yet
To settle down or even let
Someone get a hold of me
'Cause I'm not done being free
I still have a few roads
To travel down and Lord knows
I got way too close that time
That was a tough goodbye
I know I won't find anyone better
I can't keep runnin' forever
And I'm not quite ready yet
To settle down or even let
Someone get a hold of me
'Cause I'm not done being free
I still have a few roads
To travel down and Lord knows
I got way too close that time
That was a tough goodbye
That was a tough goodbye
That was a tough goodbye
And what tore me down was watchin' her try not to cry"
"Put no stone at my head, no flowers on my tomb
No gold plated sign in a marble pillared room
The one thing I want when they lay me in the ground
[Chorus]
When I die tear my stillhouse down
Oh tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace of the hiding place
Where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me
When I was a child way back in the hills
I laughed at the men who tended those stills
But that old mountain shine, it caught me somehow
[Chorus]
For all my time and money no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me
Oh tell all your children that Hell ain't no dream
'Cause Satan he lives in my whisky machine
And in my time of dying I know where I'm bound
[Chorus]
For all my time and money no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me"
"You'd never know by looking
We were ever more than strangers
But, we're celebrating ten years
Of wedded bliss
She made the rounds as usual
While, I sit here stoned, as usual
Lord, I can't believe we survived
Ten years of this!
Ten years together
A million nights alone
Whose mistake is it?
What do we blame it on?
If someone else would tell me
What I already know in my mind
I'm afraid I'd start talking
With my fists
But, I know.. I'm lying
What ain't dead, by now is dying
What in hell kept us together
For ten years of this?
Ten years together
A million nights alone!
Whose mistake is it?
What do we blame it on?
Maybe you start cheating
Because you married so young
Whatever it is, I cain't go home
I know, I cain't take it
Too long, I've had to fake it
I just don't think we can make it
Through ten more years of this...!"
"Who can it be hello hello yes this is me darling oh darling
What a surprise it's been so long why there's tears in my eyes
When will you be here what time will it be oh you're not coming I see oh I see
Well I hope you'll be happy well thank you I'll try thank you for calling goodbye
When will you be here what time will it be oh you're not coming I see oh I see
Yes operator I'll hang up the phone yes yes I know my party is gone
But I'll always love her I guess till I die thank you for calling goodbye"
"[Chorus]
I'm loving you baby
Loving me, Loving you, Loving me
And I'm inclined just to let it be let it be
I'm a loving you, loving you, lovin me
Well I'm loving you baby loving you
Loving you loving me
And I'm inclined just to let it be, let it be
I'm a loving you, loving you, loving me
Once was living life alone
Once was living but the life was gone
Once my life was just a bad routine
When you're doing it by yourself life's such a lonely thing
[Chorus: x3]"
"Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground
And Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a dollar and a dime
Well Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
Yeah Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes
Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind,
But I came into Dallas with a dollar and a dime
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night?"

"For you're as sweet as the red rose in June dear I love you adore you I do
Each night through love land we wander sweetheart telling love stories anew
Out of the blue sky a dark cloud came rolling breaking my poor heart in two
Don't leave me alone I love only you you're the one rose that's left in my heart
(You're as sweet as the red rose"
"Well if you don't know it know that I do know that I love you yes love you
Well if you don't know it baby what can I do
I tell you that I love you love you love you love you
Well how many times do you think I'm gonna tell you
How many times do you think you ought to know
I fell just like I was a hung up record I love you love you so
Well if you don't know it then you must be blind

"You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
Beneath the stars that shine
And the neon signs
I'll be down on the corner of love
When night starts to fall
And love starts to call
Down on the corner of love
You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love

When you're passin' by
Too lonesome to cry
Down on the corner of love
Just stop for a while
I'll teach you to smile
Down on the corner of love
A love that you had
Has treated you bad
Down on the corner of love
Forget what you knew
We'll start live anew
Down on the corner of love
When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
'Neath the stars up above
When the sun goes down
And the moon comes 'round
I'll be down on the corner of love

"Little girls and little boys often cry over broken toys
But tears which fall like gentle rain wash away the hurt and pain
Little girls and little boys when they grow older change their toys
They learn that life's a hurting game but never know who's to blame
No more a child is the saddest line ever written in the sands of time
No matter how heavy the tide of tears no more can they wash away the fears
Pretty women grown off men try but can't go back again
And they're lost like all the toys they had as little girls and boys
(Everything's lost like all the toys) they had as little girls and boys"
"You emptied all my pockets you took away my gold
You stripped me of my innocence and left me in the cold
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mine
You set my very soul on fire and burned it to the ground
You took my lovely little world and turned it upside down
You robbed me of my patience
And you messed up my mind
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mine
But we're gonna stick together babe cause a truer love you'll never find than mine"
"I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far
With my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say, I know it all
'Cause every time I get too high up
On my horse I fall
'Cause I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
But I'm as bad as anyone
Takin' all these blessings in my life
For granted one by one
When I start to think and it's all me
Well, something comes along
And knocks me right back on my knees and
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
He's my friend, He's my light
He's my wings, He's my flight
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'm gonna need
I've got Jesus, I got Jesus
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll ever need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
Jesus, I got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my only friend
He lifts me up, He give me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need
As long as He keeps lifting me
He is my light, He is my guide
He is my wings, He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus
I've got Jesus and that's all I need"

Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you'll know just how I feel
I saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so
Funny how I see your face everywhere I go
You smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by
So I hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry
Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel"
"I know he loves me I know he loves me I know he loves me because he told me so
I was alone until I met him now I can't forget him
Since I felt the change come over me
Oh he gave my life reason changed me like a season
From winter till a sunny summer day
I know he loves me I know he loves me I know he loves me because he told me so
[ steel ]
To me it's all a myst'ry should go down in hist'ry why yesterday I cried today I smile
Fate smile down upon me took away my lonely
Gave me love to make my life worth while
I know he loves me I know he loves me I know he loves me because he told me so
I know he loves me I know he loves me I know he loves me because he told me so"
"Oh somewhere the music's playing soft and low
And a stranger holds the one that I love so
I was blind I could not see that you meant the world to me
But like a fool I stood and watched you go
Now I'm crying my heart out over you
Those blue eyes now they smile at someome new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For I'm crying my heart out over you
Each night I climb the stairs up to my room
It seems I hear you whisper in the gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I'm crying my heart out over you."
"I'm not the first to make you cry
I always promise baby this is the last time
You believe in second chances and I love you for that
But I'm on number ninety-nine and you won't take me back
And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are
I had the chance to change your images of trust
Each time you tried before you got tangled up
I couldn't ease the pain of the hurt you'd had before
But I've got history of my own I only hurt you more
And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are
Oh, our past makes up our present
We never really get a brand new start
So you can take your heart and run
But it's gonna leave a mark
And I can't say I'm sorry
And I can't swear to God I'm gonna change
And I could tell you I will heal the wounds that cut you down
But you've got scars
And I've got scars
Love goes only so far no matter who you are"
"'Tis well I know that often folks keep wond'ring
When in my eyes a far off look they see
What can it be the cause of all my dreaming
What is this dream so very dear to me?
And truth to tell, 'tis often I go roaming
In dreams along the road of memory
To where my heart will find its consolation
Within that lovely cottage by the Lee
My home, sweet home that I so fondly cherish
The dear ones there mean everything to me
In all this world, if there can be a heaven
I'm sure it's in that cottage by the Lee
'Tis grand to stand outside that cottage doorway
And gaze across the corn fields so rich and gold
To hear the stream go rippling by the meadow
Or watch the shepherd calling to his fold
And down the lane that winds behind the garden
The blackbird greets the smiling summer morn
And as his music echoes o'er the valley
You smile and bless the day that you were born
Yes, that's my dream, my lovely dream of homeland
And though I thought a rover I could be
It's soon I found I left my heart behind me
Within that lovely cottage by the Lee"
"From the bright sunny south to the war, I was sent,
E'er the days of my boyhood, I scarcely had spent.
From it's cool shady forests and deep roaring streams,
Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.
Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.
When I had to leave home in our tender years.
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.
Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:
""As you go in defense of our dear native land,
""Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.
""Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again.""
In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,
Through my trials here on earth and to Heaven some day.
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,
In defense of this land and the word of the Lord."
"I don't like getting up too early
I like staying up and watching late-night TV
Sometimes I get my kicks from Dave's Stupid Human Tricks
Ah, but that's just me, that's just me
I've never been one for watching movies
'Less I can do it with a guitar on my knee
I think they should always end where the good guy always wins
But that's just me, that's just me
(Chorus:)
Tacoma born, family proud
Raised up with the river crowd
Under the shade of a big evergreen tree
Just an everyday average simple man
Trying to be true to who I am
That's just me, that's just me
I don't get all this hip-hop country music
Have you seen the way they dress on CMT
I think what we need is a little more Alan, Brad, and George
But that's just me, that's just me

Tacoma born, family proud
Raised up with the river crowd
Under the shade of a big evergreen tree
Just an everyday average simple man
Trying to be true to who I am
That's just me, that's just me"
"There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
Oh, if people would stop taking and just once try to give
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
La la la la la la la la la la la la
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh, wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
La la la la la la la la la la la la
All life has to offer that's what most folks desire
But offer nothing in return 'cause they don't seem to care
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh, wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
La la la la la la la la la la la la"
"On the late train to London
A woman dressed in black
Is talking on her cell phone
I'm listening at her back
She says, ""Now darling
Don't be such a kid
My man treats me better
Than you ever did""
Catching her reflection
She wipes away a tear
On the late train to London
A couple's holding hands
Been out to the country
Now they're making plans
Tuesday dinner, Thursday show
Shopping Saturday
Suddenly she to turns him
To softly say
""You've got a wife and family
You'll never leave""
Secret lovers bear the curse
The truth is hard but the lie is worse
Everybody loses, no one wins
On the late train two women
Talk and nod their heads
One says to the other
""Inside I feel dead""
""He told me that he was leaving
I've heard that before
People asking questions
Can't hold on much more
He says he loves me
What does it mean?""
Secret lovers bear the curse
The truth is hard but the lie is worse
Everybody loses, no one wins
I've been there, done that, seen it
One day you will see it too
Whatever you're running from
Will follow you"
"""Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans.
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we was hard-pressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress.
Well, Momma washed and combed and curled my hair,
Then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress.
It had a split in the side clean up to my hips.
It was red, velvet-trimmed, and it fit me good
And standin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood.
She said, ""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.""
Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, Your Pa's runned off, and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-healed shoe
It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin', ""Momma what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy.
They'll be nice to you.""
She said, ""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out girl it's up to you
Now don't let me down,
Now get on out, you better start sleepin' uptown.""
That was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby.
Momma died and I ain't been back.
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out.
It wasn't very long after that I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout.
I knew what I had to do.
Then I made myself this solemn vow:
I's gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how.
But I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame.
You know I mighta been born just plain white trash.
But Fancy was my name.
""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite.
Charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me an elegant Georgia mansion
And a New York townhouse flat.
Now I ain't done bad
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad.
They criticize Momma for turning me out
No matter how little we had.
Though haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
But I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears.
""Here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Oh, here's your last chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
God forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out well it's up to you.
Now your mama's helping you move uptown."""
"I'll remember always no I won't forget you
I'll remember always each adventure that we dared
I'll remember always all the happiness we ever shared
Then there were the other times of the sorrow we went through
But I'll remember always no I won't forget you
All the empty dreams that we once knew soon were more than filled
Lady Luck she truly smiled and put us in her will
And even now that you've gone I'll have mem'ries still unused
And I'll remember always there'll never be another you
[ steel ]
I'll remember always all the hardships we ever new
I'll remember always all the dreams we watched come true
Disappointment could come by and we'd cry when feeling blue
But I'll remember always no I won't forget you
All the empty dreams...
I'll remember always no I won't forget you"

Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night
Old love new tears I just stood there crying till you were out of sight
For you were with your new love and you passed me right on by
I tried my best to give a smile but mem'ries made me cry
Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night
[ steel ]
Old love new tears...
I turned around and slowly walked away
These tears I knew that I had shed would fall like this someday
Old love new tears cause from seeing you again last night"
"[Chorus]
Oh, it's cryin' time again, your gonna leave me,
I can see that far away look in your eyes,
I can tell by the way you hold me, darling,
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence
Makes the heart grow fonder,
And that tears are only rain to make love grow,
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger,
If I live to be a hundred years old
[Chorus]
Now you say that you've found someone you love better,
That's the way it's happened every time before,
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door"
"Country green, do you know what I mean?
She's true and pure like country green
I feel her hand upon my shoulder
Waking me from a drawn out sleep
I'm the only man to ever hold her
What we share ain't nothin' cheap
Sunday morning, we spend at God's house
Sunday evening, we spend at mine
Quiet nights down by the sawmill
We sit and talk, her hand in mine
Country green, do you know what I mean?
She's true and pure like country green
Country green, just a poor boy's dream
She makes me feel like country green
Summer rain falls down the chimney
Umm, makes a puddle on the floor
It's so good to have her with me
I don't know what I did before
Country green, do you know what I mean?
She's true and pure like country green
Country green, just a poor boy's dream
She makes me feel like country green
Country green, do you know what I mean?
She's true and pure like country green"
"River you heard my first cry as a baby
And like my mom you sang me lullabies
You knew my fishing pole
When I was eight years old
And river you never told me lies
River I can see you from my window
Your muddy water makes me feel alone
River you keep flowing
Like you know just where you're going
But river will you ever take me home
River I'm not proud of what I've done
Somehow my fishing pole became a gun
Through these prison bars I see
That you're still running free
But river I've got no place to run
River I can see you from my window
Your muddy water makes me feel alone
River you keep flowing
Like you know just where you're going
But river will you ever take me home
River I can see you"
"Honey please don't believe
I'd ever say goodbye
To you, to you
Honey please don't believe
I'd ever make you cry
Or break your precious heart in two
'cause I'm not the kind of girl
Who'd ever take your love for granted
Or run around with somebody new
And I'm not the kind of girl
Who'd ever wanna go and leave you
As long as you're feelin' the way that I do
Then I promise i'll always be true
'Cause you're not the kind of man
Who'd ever take my love for granted
Or run around like your old love did you
And I'm not the kind of girl
Who'd ever wanna go and leave you

In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight

Any place is all right long as I'm with you
[ Both ]
In a faraway land on the tropic sea sand
[ Bobby ]
If your hand's in my hand I won't be blue
[ Both ]
Way up on the mountain a way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Any place is all right long as you are there
[ Skeeter ]
You know I could be happy in just one little room with only a table and a chair
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you're there
[ Bobby ]
And I could be rich or I could be poor but if you were by my side
I could be anyplace in the whole wide world and I know that I'll be satisfied

Way up on the mountain...
Any place is all right long as you are there"
"He says, You will never know
there are no rhymes to do you justice.""
And he will sit there, outside,
until you no longer doubt his purpose.
So, I let him in.
I opened the door, and let him in.
Yah... I let him in. Opened my heart...
Some wounds will never heal
loneliness becomes an expectation.
But you stretched there by my side
and you whisper those foolish incantations.
So, I let her in
a crooked smile and I let her in
Opened the door, she walked right in
I opened my heart...
It came to me wrapped like a gift in a dream,
but then the dream disappeared
and the gift went too
and ever since I've been searching
for me and you
ever since I've been searching for you
He said, ""You will never know
there are no rhymes to do you justice.""
And he will sit there by your side
until you no longer doubt his purpose.
So, she let me in
she opened the door, I walked right in
Yah... she let me in.
Yes, she let me in
She opened the door, I walked right in.
Yah... she let me in. Opened her heart..."
"Another note afloat upon this paper sea
Explain to me
How this can be
Another face erased
From this tidal pool
Found one day
Then swept away
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another day away
From clutching hands
Explain to me
How this can be
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent
Another falling wave
Upon this crumbling beach
How many more
Until we meet?
I will carry you my love
If you can carry me
Through this summer of our discontent"

"You're throwin' around a lot of serious accusations
Ain't too hard to tell what you're insinuatin'
You think I'm the one who stole her away
And if not fo rme she'd still be yours today
We're both men here so why play games
Why don't we call a spade a spade
Man to man
Tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you
Man to man
Look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her
Why'd you make her cry
Man to man
Who cheated who
You're the one to blame
Tell me it ain't true
Man to man
Man to man
Well you think al you anger is justified
Me, I think, it's just your wounded pride
What did you really think she was gonna do
She's a real woman, not a doormat for you
You want her back, but it's too late
Why don't we just cut to the chase
Man to man
Tell me the truth, tell me
Were you ever there when she needed you

Look me in the eye, tell me
If you really loved her
Why'd you make her cry

You're the one to blame
Tell me it ain't true

"Down in Texas near the DFW among the shrubs and patios and barbecues
Was born a suburban boy named Billy be	Bad
Had a white bread momma and a rock and roll dad
Didn't have much soul or country roots but he sure looked cute in his cowboy suit
Bbb...Billy Billy be Bad, bbb..	Billy Billy be Bad
Bbbb... Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad
Bbb...	Billy Billy be Bad bbb... Billy Billy be Bad
He can spot a trend and he knows a pad he's a country singer named Billy be	Bad
He sounds like everybody on the radio he's building up his biceps for the video
The people at the label said we like to start 'em young
We know you're twenty three but we'll say you're twenty one
They played him some Strait they played him some Jones
Now he's got that country music way down in his bones
Bbb... Billy Billy be Bad...
Watch out for your daughters he's gonna drive 'em mad
The country sex symbol called Billy be	Bad
Now poor ol' Billy's at the end of the line
He's over the hill cause he's pushing twenty nine
He's not as young and he's not as handsome he just tested positive for brandson
He'll never be that hot again look for his music in the oldies bin

What a great career he had say goodbye to Billy be Bad"
"I can see the container ship in the sea
I can see the container ship in the sea
I can build a home in Albany
Came around the world from old Japan
Came around the globe from old Japan
I wonder if it has a dance band

What if the pirates come
What if the pirates come
You have come"
"Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.
It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on,
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.
I hear the death man has lost his mate,
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes,
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize.
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through,
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight."
"Redneck girl likes to cruise in Daddy's pickup truck
And a redneck girl plays her heart when she's down on her luck
Living for a Friday afternoon
She's gonna show one ole boy that weekend moon
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
She makes sweet rock n' roll while she listens to the country songs
She's waitin' for that moment of surrender
Her hands are calloused but her heart is tender
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Oh give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Oh give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
Give me a give me a give me a redneck girl
A redneck girl got a name on the back of her belt
She's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
A coyote's howling out on the prairie
First comes love then comes marriage
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Yeah give me a give me a give me a redneck girl"
"The First Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel"
"There's a letter in a shoe box
In a dresser she keeps locked
But she's never read it all the way through
It was the last one he wrote her
She was sure it was over
From all that he told her in the first line or two
He said times are hard now
Got some things left to sort out
And a man in his freedom don't easily part
That's where she stopped reading
Her soul was bleeding
So she choose her weapon and went for his heart
With paper and pen she got her last words in
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him
He couldn't believe the reply he received
What a sad tragedy for good love to end
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life
With paper and pen
Well, they say he went crazy
In just a few days he
He got on the bottle and went out of his mind
To this day she don't know
In the letter that he wrote
He asked for her hand in the very last line
With paper and pen she got her last words in
I never loved you was the lie she wrote him
He couldn't believe the reply he received
What a sad tragedy for good love to end
Who needs a knife when you can take someone's life
With paper and pen
Oh, who needs a knife when you can take someone's life

"Trash bag full of roses on the sidewalk by the street
Love lies decomposing with the flowers at her feet
Alley cat she cries picking through the bones
Trash bag full of roses, her heart has turned to stone
Don't worry I'd be eating if I had an appetite
I've never seen the sun shine this black except for night
One more second chance but she's heard that before
Don't worry I'd be breathing if she'd given me one more
My hands are on fire, they have drawn out all her water
And now her well is dry as a bone
Every treasure that I had is
On the autumn floor in ashes
Lord, lift me from this valley here below of broken souls
Letters in the deep of the drawer read of love blind
Watercolor words as my tears stain each line
She was mine to hold forever for all time
Letters in the drawer now burn the fire bright"
"They packed up all his buckles and shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked, she must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday to fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy the night she got the call
He was up in Wyoming and drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn own well it turned out that he lied
And the dreams that they'd been living in the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
They never found her body, just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had and the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin' she said, 'Then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne?
They say she just went crazy screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean and to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
Nobody can explain it, some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her on the shoreline late at night
And if you go down by the water, you'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne"
"Darling will your love be mine forever always always
Will you keep those vows we made together always always
Will your love be as strong
If my dreams should all go wrong always always
Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always
Will your love be strong enough
To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return for your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always"
"I remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in love
I bought a cassette, stole some Reds from Dad
And me and ol' Junior just burned it up
I was hooked like a fish
Every birthday wish was guitars and records
Now honey I know you miss me
I feel it when you kiss me
Trust me when I say every goodbye hurts
Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pull me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down these Nashville streets
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams
Well, I remember hearin' my song on the radio
The first time it felt like some kinda drug
Out there on the road playing show after show
Me and the boys just burnin' it up
It was all fun and games 'til the little ones came
'Cause it makes my heart bleed
When I gotta drive away and listen to 'em say
Hey daddy, why you gotta go, please don't leave
Well, damn these dreams
Playin' my heart just like a guitar string
Pullin' me away from you and everything I really need
Well, damn these dreams
Chasin' that same old whiskey melody
All up and down every small town street
It's hard to look true love in the eye and leave
Well, damn these dreams
Well, damn these dreams
Well, it's in my heart and it's in my soul
And just like you, I never can let go
These wheels just gotta roll
'Cause I remember hearin' Hank on the radio
The first time it felt like fallin' in love"
"May the fruit of my toil be yours love
May the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on
May a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love
And from this moment on
May a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love"
"12-12-84
Ten o'clock at night
Funny how you can remember
Certain moments in your life
I wish I could go back
To take back the words i said
Thought it's been years since that night
They still echo in my head
Time is a teacher
Time has taught me well
What brings a man to his knees
Is often brought on by himself
If a second chance were offered
And she could love me like before
I'd go back to the end and start over again
On 12-12-84 (Twelve twelve eighty-four)
A cold wind was blowing
It whistled through the pines
I told her I don't need her
And she told me goodbye
I remember embers dying
In the ashes and the coals
And like smoke up the chimney
I watched a true love go
Time is a teacher
Time has taught me well
What brings a man to his knees
Is often brought on by himself
If a second chance were offered
And she could love me like before
I'd go back to the end and start over again
On 12-12-84 (Twelve twelve eighty-four)"
"Stared out just a young cowboy writin' songs on a cheap guitar
Melodies were kind of rough but you knew they came from the heart
But if not for you I'd never could have ever got this far
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
From the days at the Terrace Ballroom well me made it up to Symphony Hall
I played my songs and you sang along and man we really had a ball
And you brought your little children and I've seen 'em all grow tall
Yeah I watched you grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
And all the wild and wooly cowboys dancin' and yellin' for more
Your hats and suites an cowboy boots stompin' on a hardwood floor
And you qaltzed those Utah ladies beneath the spotlight glow
Yeah you helped me grow and I owe you more than you'll ever know
I owe you more than you'll ever know"
"Blue lights flashing in my rear view
The sheriff said, ""Boy I should've known it was you
You got fourteen people in the back of this truck
I warned you twice and now I'm writing you up""
I said ""Officer, what have I done?""
He smiled and said, ""Boy you're having too much fun""
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
There was a fight Friday night at the stumble inn
Me and 'ole Harley just had to join in
Next thing you know we were both seeing stars
They threw us out, closed down the bar
I said, ""The Long Branch is open the night's still young
And we ain't never had too much fun""
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
I'm a holly terror, a tornado
Wind me up, turn me loose and let me go
Too much fun, what's that mean?
It's like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say, I've done
But I ain't never had too much fun
No matter what they say, I've done
'Cause I ain't never had to much fun
Give me the reigns and let me run
'Cause I ain't never had to much fun"
"Baby, what do you say when love comes down on you
Rainin' the blues on you
Like it's never gonna end on you
And all yourdreams like leaves in the gutter go floatin' by
No, baby, I don't know why all God's children cry
I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
And where you go I hope you find out there
A better rain
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
And lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rain
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
Long after time has erased
All the words like razor blades
You'll remember you and me before the flood
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us
I can see you on some stretch of sand
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in
A better rain
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky
Lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rain"
"I heard the front door closing softly
As I awakened from my sleep
With the last touch of her kips, Lord
Like a whisper on my cheek
And I cursed the sun for risin'
'Cause the worst, Lord, was yet to come
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'
But, come sundown, she'll be gone
See the lipstick on the pillow
That I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord
Where she lay upon my bed
And it hurts to know it's over
For the hurt, Lord, has just begun
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'
But, come sundown, she'll be gone"
"The Texas coastline hold her
Close just like a lady
And in their time they've
Weathered a storm or two.
The river feed her waters like
I feed your memory.
The deeper I go the more I'm turning blue.
The sandy beaches drift in time
And the changing tide I know
Won't bring me back to yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.
The sails out on the water will
Come take you away.
When your ship comes in I know its time to go
And the waves along the seawall
Tell me nothings here to stay
And no man is an island but I'm still all alone.
I'm weighing anchors from the past
As the south winds start to blow
Sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.
I'll be sailing out of yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico."
"Our love is unconditional
We knew it from the start
I can see it in your eyes
You can feel it from my heart
From here on after
Let's stay the way we are right now
And share all the love and laughter
That a lifetime will allow.
I cross my heart
And promise to
Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
You will always be the miracle
That makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me
I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future
It's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow
Be the best that it can be
I cross my heart
And promise to
Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
And if along the way we find a day
It starts to storm
You've got the promise of my love
To keep you warm
In all the world
You'll never find
A love as true as mine
A love as true as mine"
"Love is a thing of joy forever if it doesn't change like the weather
Yours can calls a sunny smiles and make tears fall like rain
And I wonder is the joy worth the pain
Is the joy of loving you worth the pain you put me through
Why I come back for more I can't explain
You make me feel ten feet tall while I'm riding for a fall
So I wonder is the joy worth the pain
[ piano ]
I give up my soul to win your love make it if my heart is not enough
It hurts to know I lose more ground than I can ever gain
And I wonder is the joy worth the pain
Is the joy of loving you..."
"Well, I ain't too sure about this so-called trail separation
I mean it's been three whole days
And I don't know if I can take anymore
And I know I'm the constant source of your frustration
But here I am again knockin' at your door
[Chorus]
And I'm just no damn good, am I baby
I'm just no damn good, I know it's true
Cause everyday I go a little more crazy
I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you
Well, who had the bright idea to do this kind of thing anyhow?
If it was me, well, then obviously
I was off the wall
Well, I don't blame you a bit for feelin' angry now
You're right, I'm wrong, I wasn't supposed to call
[Chorus]
No good at not holdin'
No good at not seein'
No good at not showin' you
How much I care

Everyday I go a little more crazy
Cause I'm just no damn good
At not lovin' you"
"Well here here I am in Chicago all alone near the place where we met
As I walk through the rain the wind whispers your name
Oh why won't they let me forget
'Cause when the wind blows I get lonely and one day for sure you will find
That the wind always blows in Chicago so I'm lonely most all of the time
Well folks they look so happy here on State Street
They don't know that our love's not the same
I'm alone in the crowd with my hopes in the clouds
'Cause the wind just whispers your name
Yes the wind always blows in Chicago I'm so lonely most all of the time"
"She said we're much too different
We're from two separate worlds
And he admitted she was partly right
But in his heart's defense he told her
What they had in common
Was strong enough to bond them for life
He said look behind your own soul
And the person that you'll see
Just might remind you of me
I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you
She could hardly argue
With his pure and simple logic
But logic never could convince a heart
She had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic
And he just didn't seem to fit the part
So she searched for greener pastures
But never could forget
What he whispered when she left
I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you
Was it time or was it truth
Maybe both lead her back to his door
As her tears fell at his feet
She didn't say ""I love you""
What she said meant even more
I laugh, I love, I hope, I try
I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry
And I know you do the same things, too
So we're really not that different, me and you"
"It's ten PM and I should have made the road tonight
The moon was out and the clouds came in and took it's light
My suitcase is over there somehow I just don't care
Cause I don't want to be anywhere but right here tonight
The rains came down and I should have made an early plane
Where I'd rather be if it can't be seen then I can't explain
It's so warm in here and I want to hold you near
And there is no pain or fear right here tonight
With tomorrows dawn I will carry on what I've set aside
It's not a matter of my faith or of my pride
It just seems so insane to strike out in the rain
When it's so easy to remain right here tonight"
"I like it black, just black as night
It keeps me up, it keeps me tight
It don't matter the size of the cup
Just as long as you fill it up
With black caffeine
Keeps me lean
You can hear me scream
Give me black caffeine
Oh I've got a monkey sittin on my back
And wouldn't you know he likes it black?
Don't need no cream, no nicotine
All that monkey need is the black caffeine
More black caffeine
It keeps me lean
You can hear him scream
Give me black caffeine
Give me black caffeine
I'm sound of body, I'm sound of mind
Until it comes to my coffee time
Don't stand in my way, don't hold me back
Just keep it hot and keep it black
Good black caffeine
It keeps me lean
You can hear me scream
Give me black caffeine
The devil said, I want your soul
I want your silver, I need your gold
Well you can have anything I've got
Don't let him in my coffee pot
Full of black caffeine
It keeps me lean
Can you hear me scream?
Give me black caffeine
More black caffeine
It keeps me lean
Can you hear me scream?
More black caffeine
More black caffeine
Yeah, black caffeine"
"You say you don't know what you were thinking
Well neither do I
And after the time we spent together
You think you deserve another try
Well girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye
And say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
Sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough
You say you never meant to hurt me
Well that might be true
But do you really think I should forgive you
For what you put me through
Oh I remember every time you said you loved me
But I know now your love was just a lie
And you say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
Sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough
Oh girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you look me in the eye
And say you're sorry
Oh you're sorry
So sorry
And you want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just ain't good enough"
"John Henry was a little colored boy
You could hold him on the palm of your hand
And his papa cried out this lonesome farewell
Son gonna be a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
Gonna be a steel drivin' man
John Henry went upon the mountain
Looked down on the other side
Lord, the mountain was so tall
John Henry was so small
He laid down his hammer and he cried, Lord, Lord
He laid down his hammer and he cried
John Henry told his captain
(What it is?)
I want to go to bed
Now fix me a pallet of straw to lay down
Got money roarin' in my head, Lord, Lord
Got money roarin' in my head"
"The New York City folks say I'm too country the Grinny Village hippies call me square
But at the Long Horn barroom down in Dallas Texas
They call me the Texas Troubadour there
My home state of Texas you've been good to me your wide open spaces treat me fair
The girls are so much prettier down in Texas
They don't breathe that New York City polluted air

The New York City sidewalks filled with people too busy to say hello to you there
With hearts as cold as the concrete that they walk on
They sure could use some clean fresh Texas air
Now Texas folks don't judge you till they know you
And they don't judge you then by what you wear
And you can feel at home anyplace in Texas
If you don't own a thing or if you're a millionaire
Now my home state of Texas..."
"Has it been ten years
Since we said I do
I've always heard marriage made one seem like two
But you're looking better than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in
[Chorus]
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again
The preacher man said till death do us part
That seemed like forever to a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again"
"You can't forget what love was wearing
When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers
You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest
Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers
You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers
The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers
Yeah love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beating down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers
Love remembers
(Love remembers)
(The sound of the pouring rain)
Beating down on the top of a car
(On the side of the road)
(Where it couldn't wait)"
"Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come with talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared
To stir the sound of silence
Fool, said I, you do not know, silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words and I might teach you, take my arms then I might reach you
But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence"
"Its not the end of the world its not even over
But it will be soon I never learned my lesson
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will
Its no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life
You can try and you wont find it where you're looking
You can hold it till its putty in your hands
And you cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl that cant see reason
But its nothing that a little bit of time wont heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do
Coming clean
Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life
To never believe what will have been
I can try and I wont find it where I'm looking
I can hold it till its putty in my hands
You cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy, handed lines around morality
About yourself and I don't share your point of view
Its about time to let you go and I thought its time to let you know
And it has to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And ill never be the same because we met
You might not miss this I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will"
"Long blonde hair, sky blue eyes
Yeah, that well-bred look is easy to recognize
A tailored dress, a fit so fine
And it adds up to the question on my mind
Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Can you satisfy your man, like your body says you can?
Judging from the cover, I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?
If you could read my mind, you might blush blood-red
But then again you might come over here instead
I see they brought your check and soon you're bound to go
If I don't make my move right now, I may never know
Honey, do you love as good as you look?
Can you satisfy your man, like your body says you can?
Judging from the cover, I'd love to read the book
Honey, do you love as good as you look?"
"No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart
Until you feel on solid ground
Until your strength is found, girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm ""the one""
Somebody else was here before
He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl
I'll fill those canyons in your soul
Like a river lead you home
And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm ""the one""
Trust in me and you'll find a heart so true
All I want to do is give the best of me to you
And stand beside you
Just ask it will be done
And I will prove my love
Until you're sure that I'm ""the one"""
"Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors,
Will leave you stranded on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures.
We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But He's a solid rock when troubles grow,
And He's holding out a saving hand for me.
He'll be a refuge in the storm;
He'll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way He'll be your light"
"I was lost in sin so long with no one to guide my way
My soul was in darkness had been for many a day
In that little community church house I heard that gospel song
I went inside to kneel and pray
Oh I kneeled down and prayed to my Savior
That He might hear and would accept me
And then I felt the holy spirit
I knew my soul was saved in me
In that little community church house that's where we sang and prayed
We prayed to our Father to guide us on our way
All through life's long journey we'll need His helping hand
Until we reach that promised land
In that little community church house among my many friends
I can hear them praying for me and the preacher said amen
And the vision there before me it was my Savior's face
I knew that I was saved by grace"
"Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
'Cause today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again"
"I've found all the love I ever wanted
Things so sweet I never could explain
Hold me like a prisoner who has nowhere to escape
Tied forever to a lover's chain.
You showed me the strongest love is gentle
Softer than the lightest summer rain
You don't have to try at all to keep me where I am
Locked forever in the lover's chain.
Some friends would like to take me back to where I used to be
They can't believe my old ways have all died
They wont listen to me when I try to make them see
A little love can keep me satisfied.
It took a while to make my heart surrender
Surrender proved so easy when it came
Now nothing in this crazy world could take my heart away
From the sweetness of your lover's chain."
"There's something about the heart of this man
That pushes him harder than anyone can
He may be tired and saddle worn
But a cowboy's work is never done
He needs to be free like the wind
He needs to be wild like the man that he is
Through the dog days of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done
To bed with the chickens
And up before dawn
He'll say his prayers beneath a mountain of stars
And there's cows to feed and wire to be strung
Cause a cowboy's work is never done
He needs to be free like the win
He needs to be wild like the man that he is
Through the dog days of summer
Or a hard winters storm
A cowboy's work is never done
Tonight when he lies down
He'll fall fast asleep
You see this cowboy's the last of a dying breed
Adn when he lies down he'll leave his boots on
Cause a cowboy's work is never done
He needs to be free like the wind
He needs to be wild like the man that he is
Through the dog days of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done
Through the dog days of summer
Or a hard winter storm
A cowboy's work is never done
No a cowboy's work is never done"
"Troubled in mind, I'm little blue
Bet you I won't be blue always
'Cause that ol' sun's gonna shine
On Jerry Lee Lewis's back door step someday
I'm gonna lay my head
On somebody's lonesome railroad line
Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind
Well, they tell me that old graveyard
Is a mighty lonesome place
Lord they put you six feet under
Shovellin' mud directly in your face
Well, goodbye baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too
Oh, don't meet you over yonder, baby
When they throw that Jerry right over you"
"(Oh ooh oooh) [x4]
In a world of deceivers, can't find no believers
Could it be that there's none of them left?
Dumped in a river when I was delivered
The doctor, he cursed me under his breath
sayin, ""Boy, just be thankful you're breathin'
Don't be wishin' for no one to care
Boy, you won't ever get even
There ain't no place for that around here"" [x2]
Why's the devil always got his foot on my neck? [x4]
In a world full of others, can't find me a brother
Could it be I'm a bastard or worse?
Was left here to suffer by my starvin' mother
My father, he hung on the day of my birth
Said boy, just be thankful you're breathin'
Don't be wishing for no one to love
Boy, don't be thinkin' of thievin'
You'll pay for your sins below or above [x2]
(Oh ooh oooh) [x4]
In a life full of trouble that's never been subtle
You could say I'm the prince of all pain
'cos if heartache's a kingdom I'd have wealth and dominion
And all of my debts, they would surely be paid
Boy, just be thankful you're breathing
Don't be wishin' for no one to care
No, there's no way to get even
There ain't no place for that around here
Why's the devil always got his foot on my neck? [x4]
Thought I could bargain with the father of lies
I tried to make my peace of the edge of a knife
Why am I so surprised to be playing with fire?
Got hell to pay the fiddler when the deal expires
Get your foot off my neck [x2]
Get your foot up off my neck"
"I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires"
"I remember trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And 3 weeks later in the front porch light taking 45 min to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet but I thought I loved you then
Chorus
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then.
I remember taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care I got down on one knee right there
And once again I thought I loved you then
Chorus
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then.
I can just see you with a baby on the way
I can just see you when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before.
Now you're my whole life now you're my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Well look back some day at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say and I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then..."
"Life is just a passing moment
On an never ending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a heart
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
There's eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
O my spirit hollers to go on
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
Someday I'll be satisfied"
"All I left behind should come as no surprise
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Silver earrings in Wichita
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah
But I had you, so
I just let them go
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio
Never did my armor feel so thin
Silk was all I had between me and your skin
Like Waterloo, I lost that too
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed
On the back by the one who loved him all her life
The way I too could have loved you
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade
Of the lamp that lit the room
That last night near Cour d'Alene
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Of all I left behind"
"Spring could come you'd never show it love could come you'd never know it
Life has drawn so many tears from your eyes
You've been used then lost the user you've been branded as a loser
Where did all the sincere people go
When love is gone it will not return
The river's full of your tears the bridges have been burned
Someone took your four leaf clover all your lucky days are over
That's the way you feel when love is gone
Nights're long dawn is heartless quiet heartaches in the darkness
How could scars so deep still plainly show
All the old dreams so delicious all the news came so suspicious
Where did all the simple pleasures go
When love is gone"
"Oh I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me along on my way
Until I heard Jesus calling saying come unto me
And I'm traveling on and on
Oh Lord I'm traveling on by the help of my Savior
I can never more stray for Jesus leads the way
And my heaven lies awaiting at the end of my journey (my journey)
Oh Lord I'm traveling on and on
Oh I can hear Jesus calling and his voice sounds so sweet
And I knew that the time would come to me that he'd speak
But these trials are over for he bid me come home
Now I'm traveling on and on
Oh the Lord is my savior I will walk with him each day
He will help and protect me to the end of the way
My journey soon will be over and I'll join a happy band
Now I'm traveling on and on"
"I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
Though our pathways have parted
To your memory I'm true
Guess I'll stay broken-hearted
How's the world treating you?
Do you wonder about me
Like I'm hoping you do?
Are you lonesome without me?
Have you found someone new?
Are you burning and yearning?
Do you ever get blue?
Do you think of returning?
How's the world treating you?"
"It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame,
It ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she threw out the window,
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
Best thing I remember was the young familiar taste of someone on my lips,
It's to late to turn around,
When the shades start coming down,
The guilt you feel's the last thing on your mind
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me, let it rain
So let it rain, let it pour, if she don't love me anymore,
Just let it come down on me, let it come down on me,
Every word, let it hurt, even more than I deserve, just let it come down on me,
Let it come down on me, let it rain,
Ooh let it rain, ooh let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain, ooh let it rain"
"Yeah, she's the one
The one I told you all about
Yeah, it was serious, but it was long ago
She just might walk over here
And give me a kiss for old times
But don't you worry, dear
Old times, next to you, can never come close
[Chorus]
I'll take today over yesterday, anyday
I'll take lyin' in your arms tonight
Over and above any love I've known
Memories may find me, but they'll always be behind me
I'll take today over yesterday, anyday
I'd be lyin' if I tried to tell you now
That I never loved her
And she doesn't ever cross my mind
But that was yesterday, and baby, I don't want to go back
Here is where I'm gonna stay
With you in each tomorrow of my life
[Chorus]"
"I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said I know what' s on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass ain't always greener on the other side
Then what
What you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
And you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trust
Then what
Where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you've burned
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what, oh then what
I ain't sayin' that lookin's a crime
I've done my share from time to time
It don't mean that you got to take that leap
When you're standin' on the brink
Before you jump you gotta step back and think
There's a price for every promise you don't keep
Then what
What you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
And you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trust
Then what
Where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you've burned
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what, oh then what
But do what you want do what you wish
It's your life but remember this
There's bound to be some consequences
For sneakin' under certain fences
Then what
What you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust
And you ain't anybody anyone's gonna trust
Then what
Where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you've burned
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt
Then what, oh then what"
"I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
I still want you, still need you
Just as much as always
I hoped that I'd find someone else
But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you , just as much as always
I hoped that I'd forget your touch
But I still want it just as much
And I still need it just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still love you, oh I do love you
Just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
I still love you, still want you, just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still need you still love you
Just as much as always"
"A man has his dream
He hopes he prays
He laughs he cries
A man tries his best
Sometimes he falls
A man does what he has to do
And a woman does too
A mand wants to love
With all his heart
He's not afraid
A man needs someone to share his life
He wants someone to hold at night
Like baby I do
Yeah a woman does too
[Chorus:]
So baby lay down here beside me
Sometimes a man just needs two arms to fall into
And if you wanna know the truth
A woman does too
A man has to be strong
Standing tall
To make his way
A man takes on the world
Holds his ground
He has so much he has to prove
And a woman does too
[Chorus:]
So baby lay down here beside me
Sometimes a man just needs two arms to fall into
And if you wanna know the truth
A woman does too
A woman does too
This woman does too"
"Way up high in the Sierra peaks where the yellow jack pines grow tall
Old Sandy Bob and Buster Jiggs had a roundup camp last fall
Oh, they'd taken the horses and the runnin' irons and may be a dog or two
And they swore they'd brand all long ear calves that came within their view
And any old doggie that flapped long ears and didn't brush up by day
Got his long ears whittled and his old hid scorched in a most artistic way
Now one fine day old Sandy Bob he throwed his easy go down
Well I'm sick of the smell of this here burnin' hair and allows I'm a goin' to town
[ harmonica ]
So they saddles up and they hits 'em a lope for it weren't no sign of a ride
And them was the days when a buckaroo could oil up his insides
Oh they starts her off at Kentucky Bar at the head of a whiskey row
And they winds up down at the depot house some forty drinks below
And then sets up and turns around and goes her the other way
And to tell you the god forsaken truth them boys got stewed that day
As they was a ridin' back to camp a packin' a pretty good load
Well who should they meet but the devil himself a prancin' down the road
[ guitar ]
Say he you ornery cowboy skunks you better hunt your holes
For I've come up from hells Rim Rock to gather in your souls
Says Sandy Bob old devil be damned we boys is kinda tight
And ya ain't gonna get no cowboy souls without one hell of a fight
So Snady Bob punched a hole in his rope and he swang her straight and true
And he lapped it onto the devils' horns and he taken his dallies too
Now Buster Jiggs was a reita man with his gut line coiled up neat
So he shakes her out and he built him a loop and he lassoed up the devil's hind feet
[ harmonica ]
Well they stretched him out and they tailed him down while the iron was gettin' hot
And they cropped and swallow forked both his ears and they branded him up a lot
They pruned him up whit a dehorning saw and they knotted his tail for a joke
And then rode off and left him there neck to a blackjack oak
So if your ever up high in the Sierra peaks and you hear one hell of a wail
You'll know it's that devil a bellerin' about them knots tied in his tail"
"Speaking confidentially
The fire that burnt inside of me
Has turned to ash the tortured tree
That grows beside the anguished sea
Speaking confidentially
Speaking metaphorically
The earth I trust beneath my feet
Is moving now ever so slightly
I shift my feet but feel no relief
Speaking metaphorically
Speaking hypothetically
If the air you breathed was so unique
Would you use it up to idly speak
Or horde it for a rainy week
Speaking hypothetically
Speaking kind of cryptically
The sea that raged beside the tree
Burning bright for all to see
It just might mean the most to me
Speaking kind of cryptically"
"I love you because you understand dear every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you cause you're you
I love you because my heart is lighter every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter the door to happiness you've opened wide
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you because you're you"
"(Dolly Parton/Larry Weiss)
Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
Don't even know if I'll see you again
But against your warm body I felt so alive
And you got me over a heartache tonight
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep
I had lost something I wanted to keep
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
And you got me over a heartache tonight
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
Led to an evening of making romance
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'Cause you got me over a heartache tonight"
"I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just a-hopin you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I stop to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm as lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just a-hopin you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me
I go out walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you"
"Just like a re-run movie
I see that scene again
And that feeling shoots right through me
'Cause this time I know the end
And I've seen it played so many times
And I've watched it frame by frame
And I don't have to guess who loses
And I know who'll feel the pain
[Chorus]
You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door
I think I'll go down to the picture show
See if they're playin' somethin' new
Maybe one with a happy ending
And I'll pretend it's me and you
But I know that it's just make-believe
So I won't even try
To tell myself that you're not gonna leave
And that you'll never say goodbye
[Chorus]"
"Hypocrite, don't you know what you do,
Their eyes watching your every move?
You knaw the truth, but you live a lie
And slither down from your altar high
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
It's a dead man's charade, liven' brother,
Hypocrite,
Don't you know what you do?
You're way too old if you're calling for peace
You're diagnosing, and you're the disease
You betrayed words on the shepherd's soul
Scatter the flock to the rocks below
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
Tell me whose roof you're living under,
Hypocrite,
Don't you know what you do?
Don't tell anyone else. You're one to hiss!
Don't tell anyone else. you're one to hiss!
You say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
You burn the fields and poison the waters
Say one thing and you do another
You say one thing and you do another
I can't believe what I see in the mirror."
"MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT IT ALL
Writers Bill Anderson, Steve Wariner
RECORDED BY DIAMOND RIO AND BY GENE WATSON
I'm watching you go from room to room
With all your boxes and your broom
Packing up, sweeping out and taking down
From off the wall
Everything that's part of us
Tear my whole world down if you must
Don't even leave one little speck of dust
Make sure you've got it all
Chorus
Take my heart, take my soul
Take it all with you when you go
Just leave the floor here to catch me when I fall
You stole my pride and dignity
You took it all away from me
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all
Don't even leave one photograph
The memory of one smile or laugh
Check the closet up in the attic and down the hall
Take your time, take your rings
Take the sandbox and the swings
Without a family they're just things
Make sure you've got it all
Repeat chorus
Tag
Take one last look around, girl, before you leave
Make sure you've got it all"
"Hey I'm just staring out the window, baby don't mind me
But it's been a couple weeks since I walked on something but concrete
This big city's getting to me, I'm having hillbilly dreams
I'm hearing Haggard songs, it's been too long
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Cane pole stuck in the sand
That's the kind of mood that I'm in
I can't focus on anything else but getting us gone
I got this crazy desire to go out and sit by a fire
Maybe light up cheap cigars, Willy on guitar
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yeah, I'm thinking country
So just go with me baby, come on, help me concentrate
I know we're sitting downtown but I'm in some other
You know I'm in some other place
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yes, I'm thinking country
It's been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Oh, I'm thinking country"
"The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset,
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer,
But my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles on line
This end of the tunnel is neon
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime for people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted
That's why they invented
Neon, the light they always leave on
The weekend on the rocks
An old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
It's the buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles on line
This end of the tunnel is always neon
You know I've seen it all
From the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer,
But my favorite color is
Neon, the light they always leave on
Put a double on your troubles
This end of the tunnel is neon"
"I never thought I'd feel
Feel the way I do
When I'm in your arms
ba da ba ba
Sing your melody to me
And if you want me to leave
I'd walk away from this old farm
ba da ba ba
Baby, baby,
There ain't no cows left for milking
Baby, baby,
There ain't no chickens laying nothing
I'll walk on anything for you
I'll walk on anything for you
I'll walk off on anything for you
I'll walk off on anything for you
I was always told that
I would find somebody
I could keep a promise for
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To a broken-hearted man
I felt that way before
ba da ba ba
Baby, baby,
I don't remember feeling that way
Baby, baby,
And I owe it all to you
I'd take a nine to five for you
I'll take that nine to five for you
I'd take a nine to five for you
I'll work that nine to five for you
I'm convinced that nothings true
Just cause love worked out for you
Don't impress me no more
ba da ba ba
Words that don't mean a thing
To me I'm a broken-hearted man
I got dreams but nothing to hope for
ba da ba ba
Lady, lady,
Keep your distance I mean no good
Lady, lady,
I'm broken-hearted and I think the world should
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
All be broken-hearted too
Ya'll should be broken-hearted too
I'd like to give all my pain to you
If I could I'd give all my pain to you"
"It was sometime late September
The leaves were gold and green
My baby's eyes were the saddest sight I'd ever seen
Two summers back I loved him
Two years I cried and tried
But I tell you, too many teardrops falling down cannot be dried
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
So something came between us
A feeling cold as ice
By October there was frost and I knew our love was lost
November made me bitter
As the wind blew through my heart
Oh, so empty in the deepest darkest tiny part
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
There'd be snow come mid-December
And I'll be frozen to the bone
Oh, but by then it will all be over
It's been a long hard fall
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall
Long hard fall
It's been a long hard fall
Long hard fall"
"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I've begged you to be different but you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving now, there's nothing I can do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
You made our lover's lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we had to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each blue tomorrow
With a broken heart you taught to cry
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
One for every time you broke my heart"
"Wish I may. Wish I might. Upon my favorite star. Let me see, let me feel the world from where you are. Someday soon, Mr. moon I will touch your face. I'll flutter by, lady butterfly. Challenge eagles to a chase. Round and round, and up and down. No boundaries no fears. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. Mountain high, valley low. Where the wind is free. I will see, I will know the world the angels see. Mr. sun, I will run rings around your sky. Down below they'll finally know that this heart was made to fly. Round and round, and up and down. No boundaries no fears. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. Way up here, playing hide and seek in rainbows. Way up here, where I'm supposed to be. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here. My heart was born to dream to see the world from way up here."
"I cry myself to sleep each night wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you lay your head now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a hurtin' every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you're gone
They say a man should never cry but when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free but you forgot your memory
And it keeps right on a hurtin' since you're gone
It keeps right on a hurtin'..."
"There's something dark inside of me.
There is a ghost in this machine.
There is a giant jagged hole.
Twists and rips through my soul.
Like the roots of some old retched tree.
There's something dark inside of me.
There's something haunting, all my love.
There's nothing good I'm thinking of.
Still I'm gilded and groomed, gliding into the room.
Saying such bold and beautiful things.
There's something dark inside of me.
There's something rumbling in my mind.
Secrets that you weren't meant to find.
You thought you knew me so well?
I will see you in hell
Before I let you live to tell what you've seen
There's something dark inside of me.
I need someone to set me free.
So I call out your name
But you seem so far away.
And anyway, who could save one like me?
Cause' there's something dark inside of me."
"More wishes than a thousand hearts can count for you
More smiles than a merry-go-round
The sweetest ending to a bedtime story told
My love follows you where you go
More laughter than a kindergarten out to play
One Sunday morning song that says it all
More summer than the California beach can hold
My love follows you where you go
Future like a promise
Your city of gold
Stubborn in your bones and
Jesus in your soul
Seeing you stand there
Starin' at the unknown
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me
Watchin' you walk away slow
Take forgiveness, take a prayer, take the deepest breath
And take the answers in your heart
When you wake up and the world is cruel and cold
My love follows you where you go
Future like a promise
Your city of gold
Stubborn in your bones and
Jesus in your soul
Seeing you stand there
Starin' at the unknown
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me
Watchin' you walk away slow
More freedom than a field of flowers in the day
More beauty than a mornin' after rain
Up the steepest hill, a dark and crooked road
My love follows you where you go
Future like a promise
Your city of gold
Stubborn in your bones and
Jesus in your soul
Seeing you stand there
Starin' at the unknown
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me
Watchin' you walk away slow"
"How much reassurance does a man need?
Why can't I just let a good thing be?
Is it just me, something don't seem right
In my whole life I've never been so close to anyone, anything, some girl I know
I gotta let go and give up the fight
You keep talking like everything's gonna be alright
So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?
Trying to understand, explain everything
Over analyze us like we're some game
Trying to find pain
Where there's only love
It's maybe just that I've never been this far
Never walked through so many open doors
And when I get more, it's never enough
You and me babe
I know we're right as rain
So why do I feel like you're slipping away?
So dark in my heart girl
Too many times torn apart girl
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel like that when it feels like this?
Better than the best it's ever been
Lost in your body here in the dark
Your fingers, my skin: a match and a spark
I told myself I'd make a brand new start
I wanna believe what you're trying to say
Girl I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Yeah, I'm trying to listen
Don't want my suspicions to drive you away
Why do I, why do I keep messing with a good thing?
Why do I feel?
Why do I feel?"
"Seven years old, everything was right
A table for four on a Friday night
Didn't see any signs of a dead end road
By the time I was ten everything was changing
Fell asleep every night praying
Didn't know which way to go
Momma did her best to hide her anger
And I did my best to try and save her
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away and take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
We moved into a smaller house
How mama did it, oh I don't know how
Never went to bed without eating
At thirteen I finally realized what it means to get on with your life
Well daddy sure did and he made it look easy
Mama did her best to hide the struggle
And I did my best to stay out of trouble
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
When dad would drive away and take his love with him
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
I wish that I could turn back time and tell myself it'll be alright, you're never gonna lose the light in your eyes.
I was a little too young and a little too dumb to ever think the day would come
So I grew up fast in a whole new world
Waved goodbye to that little girl
I can see her now, innocent and seven
I wish I had never turned eleven
I wish I had never turned eleven."
"Years from now, I'll want you years from now
I'll hold you years from now as I hold you tonight
You are my one true friend always my one true friend
And I'll love you till life's end, as I love you tonight
I know this world that we live in can be hard now and then
And it will be again, many times we've been down
Still love has kept us together for the flame never dies
When I look in your eyes the future I see
Holding you years from now
Wanting you years from now
Loving you years from now
As I love you tonight"
"Let's get Ricky with it.
He's into aviation and scientology.
He's been my fascination ever since that movie Grease.
It's become an addiction I get the fever every Saturday night
For urban cowboy and pulp fiction, boy in the bubble makes me cry.
Phenomenon and face off earned him critical acclaim.
I'd love to live his crazy life, have his fortune and his fame
And a few of his old flames.
Hair blowed up way out livin' like John Travolta
Bee Gees turned up loud, livin' like John Travolta,
Buy my own leer jet if I wasn't so broka.
Known all over town livin' like John Travolta.
Wish I was john Travolta livin' like John Travolta Ah, ah, ah, ah-choo
Tried to make it in New York city just like ole Johnny did
I got a part in a bad big movie that film was a piece of sh(bleep).
Welcome Back Kotter Barbarino was his name.
With Horshack, Juan, Washington those sweat hogs were insane,
But I love him just the same.
But no. High school I dropped out livin' like john Travolta.
Put on a few pounds livin' like John Travolta.
Named my first son jeb my wife thinks I've gone loca
All I talk about is livin' like John Travolta
Wish I was john Travolta living like John Travolta.
His last name means high voltage,
There's greased lightening in his pants.
Quentin Tarantino pulled his career out of the drain
Maybe he could do the same, for me.
Pants legs flared way out. Livin' like john Travolta.
Burned the dance floor down living like john Travolta.
Films are never bound more hits than Sammy Sosa.
I am all about livin' like John Travolta,
Wish I was John Travolta livin' like John Travolta."
"Love be gentle love be kind as I give this heart of mine
To a new love I hope will never end
It seems like only yesterday love was here and went away
Out of love again but now I'm fallin' in
Fallin' in love again I'd fallen out but there's no doubt I'm fallin' in love again
I know that love won't always last when you fall in love too fast
I should know better but here I go again
Love be strong love be true for what else can I do
Love is callin' and I know I'm fallin' in
Fallin' in love again I'd fallen out but there's no doubt I'm fallin' in love again
Fallin' in love again I'd fallen out but there's no doubt I'm fallin' in love again"
"Mother, do not cry for me
All of this is exactly how it's supposed to be
I'm right here. Can you hear my voice?
My life, my love, my Lord
my baby boy
As they nail me to this tree
Just know the Father waits for me
God how can this be your will?
To have your son and my son killed?
Whatever happens, whatever you see,
Whatever your eyes tell you has become of me
This is not
Not the end
I am making all things new again
I remember when you were born
In that manger where I first held
You in my arms
So many miracles and lives you've changed
And this world repays you how?
With all this pain
Whatever happens (Whatever happens)
whatever you see(I don't wanna see)
Whatever your eyes tell you has become of me
This is not
Not the end
I am making all things new again."
"Precious mem'ries unseen angels sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me as the sacred past unfolds
Precious mem'ries how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes of my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious mem'ries how they linger..."
"I didn't know till I met you how foolish I could be
The biggest fool in Tennessee is part compared with me
I let myself fall in love with you and now it's plain to see
The biggest fool in Tennessee knows more about love than me
You had some kisses to spare and I just happened to be there
Well go ahead now and have your laugh but remember when you do
The biggest fool in Tennessee may turn out to be you"
"Let's put our world back together
Let's try our love one more time
Let's put our world back together
Without you in my world the sun won't shine
I've tried but I can't live my life without you
There's darkness in my world all the time
We had everything together then it just fell apart
I've lost my heart to you don't take my mind
Let's put our world back together...
For without you in my world the sun won't shine"
"With tears in my eyes dear I beg you to stay
You wouldn't believe me so you went away
I made a mistake dear by telling you lies now I lay awake dear with tears in my eyes
No more to be sweethearts no more to be friends
Just give me a chance dear and I'll make commands
My yesterdays haunt me my weary heart cries
I just can't go on dear with tears in my eyes
[ ac.guitar ]
If you ever need me oh please let me know wherever you leave me I'm willing to go
But past is a flower that withers and dies I'll wake up tomorrow with tears in my eyes
With tears in my eyes dear..."
"I dreamed of my dad and my mama, and baby when she was just 3, and I know that someday they'll be waiting..."
"I did some honky tonk healin' to get me over you
It took some neon nurses around the clock to pull me through
I was in critical condition my heart was broken in two
Due to honky tonk healin', I'm feeling good as new
Well thank you for callin' is all I can say
'Cause your get well wishes dear, are just a little too late
Did you think I'd be laid up, heartbroken and blue?
And missin' your kissin', well honey, here's the news
I did some honky tonk healin' to get me over you
It took some neon nurses around the clock to pull me through
I was in critical condition my heart was broken in two
Due to honky tonk healin', I'm feeling good as new
Drop by some evening, if you can catch me home
We'll share a few memories, if that's what you want
Don't be expecting the same fool, you left crying in vain
It's been a smooth operation they removed all the pain"
"The phone lights up in the dark, asks where you are and I start driving
Meet me for a drink, just an hour, maybe two, maybe three, baby I'm in
Girl, you can't take your eyes off me
And that first kiss is sweet relief, ain't no one gotta know
Just one more before you go
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the dark, gotta go, I know, but it still ain't easy
Tomorrow, you'll be waking up beside him, tell him that you love him but you still see me
In my mind when I'm looking at him
And in my eyes it's the obvious elephant in the room
He can't see it, but girl, you do
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but I will if you want me to
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
I'll be the moon
Yeah, he can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the dark, yes, it's my turn and I start driving
I don't wanna be a liar
I don't wanna be a fool
I don't wanna be a secret but this is something I can't lose
You can leave me in the dark if that's all I get from you
He can be the sun
And I'll be the moon
He can be the sun, I'll be the moon
The phone lights up in the dark"
"(Abilene Abilene prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene my Abilene)

"I got two arms that reach for you I got two eyes that watch for you
I got a heart that's a beatin' true for you you you
I take the moon from the sky for you and I drain the ocean dry for you
I climb the mountains high it's true for you you you
You you only you you're what it takes to make my dreams come true
I got a little dog that wags his tail for you I got a little boat that I'd sail for you
And I'd like to spend my whole life through with you you you

You you only you you're what it takes to make my dreams come true
There's a cute little house that I'll buy for you the moment that you say I do
And there I'll spend my whole life through with you you you yes me and you"
"Back in the innocent days there was a young Cowboy
Who was in love with a Mexican girl,
Only she didn't know it,
And he would watch her when she walked back,
In the cotton dress which danced in the wind
And her eyes held the stars
Now, she was the most beautiful thing
That cowboy had ever seen
Sent down straight from heaven
But he was afraid he would never win her heart
'Cause of some family scars left by the rain forest
But oww... how he loved her
Senoritra passing by
Pardon me if i stop and ask you why
Senorita could it be
Someone like you could love someone like me
So he walked up to her
Tipped his hat and introduced himself
And she looked up at him and didn't know what to say.
So he told her the story of his family
The trouble that brought the barbed wire
And all the things that he could'nt change
And then he told her that he loved her
And studied her reaction
And by the time the spring rains came
They were married
And there's an ol' song that my family used to sing
'Bout a young cowboy and a mexican girl
How they fell in love
Senorita passing by
Pardon me if i stop and ask you why
Senorita could it be
Someone like you could love someone like me
Senoritra passing by
Pardon me if i stop and ask you why
Senorita could it be
Someone like you could love someone like
Someone like you could love someone like me"
"I wake up with the sun on my face
On the edge of the bed, babe you're taking up all the space
I roll you over then I give you a kiss
Meet you in the middle
That's where all the fun is
[Chorus]
Life as we know it
It's going good
That's an understatement
It's going better than I ever thought it could
Never been so happy, so content
Oh, I wish I could freeze this moment
Life as we know it, now
You're doing dishes if I'm cooking the meal
We got an understanding, and it's a pretty good deal
We read our books at each end of the couch
No conversation needed
To stay in touch in this house
[Chorus]
I whisper, I love you
You tell me, you love me too
It's so easy, so simple
I wonder why we didn't think of this before
[Chorus]"
"My Lord how the rains came down
The waters made a mighty sound
When the levees broke that day
Washin' all those souls away
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground
It takes more than a hurricane
To empty out the Pontchartrain
Long ago we broke the chains
In New Oreleans New Orleans
When Brother Bill and Sister Nell
Are singing like a ringing bell
Then you'll know all is well
In New Orleans New Orleans
Bring it all, fire and flood
Fill the rivers up with mud
To cut and run ain't in our blood
We are New Orleans
So baby let the life roll on
The blues were made to make us strong
We're walkin' in a brighter day
Nothin' can get in our way
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground"
"Smooth land a risin'
Eastern Idaho plateau
White Cloud's on the horizon
As up the highway I go
To where the mighty Buffalo
Starts its journey to the sea
I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
And oh that blue water's rollin'
High and muddy in the spring
Feel her sweet but cold wind
Can you listen to her sing
Through the valley and the timber below
A whisper through the aspen tree
I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
Oh the color on the mountain
And the color in the sky
Autumn in the air
And a tear in my eye
For I could never stay I know
But my heart will never leave
For I can feel Lady Idaho
Callin' out for me
She's reachin' out for me
She's holdin' on to me"
"As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said, ""Goodbye""
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded love"
"If the wife and I are fussin' brother that's our right
Cause me and that sweet woman's got a licence to fight
Why don't you mind your own business mind your own business
Cause if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
On the woman on our party line's a nosey thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Well I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle out every time she walks by
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
[ guitar ]
If I wanna honky tonk around till two or three
Brother that's my headache don't you worry bout me
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
So if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
Mindin' other people's business seems to be hightone
But I got all that I can do just midin' my own
Why don't you mind your own businesss mind your own business
For if you mind your own business then you won't be mindin' mine
For if you mind your own business you'll stay busy all the time"
"Every night it's the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that you'll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess there's someone else you've found
So why you're still coming round
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows
I've heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I don't know who's right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows
I'm going to turn and walk away
There's nothing left for me to say
It wouldn't change things anyway
Though, I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well, I don't know what else to do
And how I'll ever get over you
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
That's the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How love's made a fool of me
I guess that's how it's meant to be but
Heaven only knows"
"I've done everything a girl suppose to do
When she's trying hard to prove her love is true
I've given up the things you asked me to tell me darling what else can I do
Must I fall down on my knees and beg your mercy or cry until my eyes no longer see
When I give all I can give and my fate is left with you
Tell me darling what else can I do
[ steel ]
Must I fall down on my knees...
Tell me darling what else can I do"
"Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song
Shoo fly don?t bother me
Shoo fly don?t bother me
Shoo fly don?t bother me
I don?t want your company
Flies in the buttermilk two by two
Flies in the buttermilk shoo fly shoo
Flies in the buttermilk skip tae ma loo
Skip tae ma loo my darlin
Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song
When I was young I used to wait
Upon my master and drain his plate
And pass the bottle when his was dry
And wash away the blue tail fly
Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t care
Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t care
Jimmy crack corn ?n I don?t caaare
The Master?s gone away
Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song"
"I remember the times when the devil himself packed a bad seed in life for fear
Bonnie and Clyde were the talk of the land everybody talked about the Barrow gang
Oh the Barrow gang will get you little man I remember my mama would say
Do you listen and wash your hands or the Barrow gang will get you little man
[ dobro ]
When I went to school there was one sure way to silence the noise of the kids
The teacher would say work your fingers to the bone
Or the Barrow gang will get you if you don't
Oh the Barrow gang will get you...
[ banjo ]
On Sunday morning in the little white church I was talked of Bonnie and Clyde
We learned about joy and we learned about the veil
And the Barrow gang will get you if you fail
Oh the Barrow gang will get you...
Or the Barrow gang will get you little man or the Barrow gang will get you little man"
"Life is seen more clearly through our tears
Cause we all find some faith
When we face our fears
When my life's goin like I want
God becomes an after thought
And I start trying to build my Heaven here
[Chorus]
A better believer would look to the skies
And shout ""hallelujah"" with tears in his eyes
Open his heart and start givin it all away
When I take a hard look at myself
And count my blessings I can't but help
But wonder if there's been some kind of mistake
This life of mine should belong to a better believer
All we really need in life is love
And in my time I've had more than enough
But some days I'm not satisfied
It happens to me ever the time
I look around instead of looking up
[Chorus]
Bridge
With all I've got to be thankful for
I should be doing so much more
I know
[Chorus]"
"T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Telma the gal
Who made a wreck out of me
If you don't want me, mama, you sure don't have to stall
If you don't want me, mama, you sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
Gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
Gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Telma just to see her jump and fall
Rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like an old hound dog
Gonna buy me a shotgun with a big long shiny belt
Gonna get me a shotgun with a big long shiny belt
Gonna shoot that rounder the one who stole away my gal
T for Texas, T for Tennessee"
"I woke up this morning smelling like lemons
Salt on the back of my hands
Mouth was so dry
I couldn't even spit My eyes felt
like they were full of sand
I called Troy Jenkins to see if he survived
My head pounding like a stone
He started reeling off things I did last night
And I cried out over the phone
I did what? I smooched who?
Oh tell me the boss wasn't there
And that I caused quite a scene
When I stripped off my jeans
And did a slide in my underwear
I did what? I mooned who?
Oh this time I guess I crossed the line
There'll be hell to pay
But what can I say
I must've had a real good time
Troy laughed and said some guy named Red's
Been looking for you all night
And oh by the way his girl said to say
""Just come back any old time""
Then he went down the list of the things I'd done
As I listened in misery I was thinking real hard
about leaving town And changing my identity
Chores
What can I say I had a bad day
I guess I just lost my mind
It's all just a blur
But one things for sure
I must've had a real good time"
"I've been torn between
Of what you want and what I need
Though I think it's the same thing
And if you look in my eyes
There's a burning fire inside
And I know you feel it too
But there's a road I'm on
I've been waiting for so long
But I'll be like the morning dew, back to you
When I reach my destiny
I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you
So if I take my time
And if I spread my wings to fly
Oh, the wind will carry me through
Back to you
When I reach my destiny
I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you
Don't worry about them distance
That's keeping us apart
The candle keeps on burning
Trust me with your heart
And when I reach my destiny
You know I can guarantee
Though the roads may all be new
One thing that is true
They'll be leading me back to you
Well, back to you, oh
All those years, back to you
All those years, back to you
All those years"
"On a good day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm gonna be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
So set em up
Here's a hundred dollars keep em comin' joe (whoa whoa)
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
On a good day, I would never crash a party
Knowin' she'd be there with someone else
And on a good day, I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
On a good day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
Yeah I only see you joe
When I'm not havin' a good day
No I'm not havin' a good day."
"THAT WONDERFUL MOTHER OF MINE
Writers Walter Goodwin, Clyde Hager
The moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of that wonderful mother of mine.
The birds never sing but a message they bring
Of that wonderful mother of mine.
Just to bring back the time, that was so sweet to me,
Just to bring back the days, when I sat on her knee.
You are a wonderful mother,
Dear old Mother of mine.
You'll hold a spot down deep in my heart,
'Till the stars no longer shine.
Your soul shall live on forever,
On through the fields of time.
For there'll never be another to me,
Like that wonderful Mother of mine
I pray ev'ry night to our Father above,
For that wonderful mother of mine.
I ask Him to keep her as long as He can
That wonderful mother of mine.
There are treasures on earth,
that made life seem worthwhile,
But there's none can compare to my mother's smile.
You are a wonderful mother,
Dear old Mother of mine.
You'll hold a spot down deep in my heart,
'Till the stars no longer shine.
Your soul shall live on forever,
On through the fields of time.
For there'll never be another to me,
Like that wonderful Mother of mine"
"When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
Then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there"
"Lisa used to love to dance
Ever since she was ten years old
Her bare feet raising dust on a yard
Where the grass wouldn't grow
Slowly spinning round and round
To the music playing in her head
Late at night it could almost drown out
The whiskey on her old man's breath
The wrecking yards and dingy bars
And abandoned factories
But down among the jagged souls
A ballerina sways unseen
Hard edges hide a tender heart
Silent as a midnight prayer
Hard edges hide the sweetest part
Till you'd never know it's there
Lisa's in a club downtown
Where the neon burns till dawn
She calls herself Tina now
But she dances to the same old songs
Slowly spinning round and round
In the smoke and the smell of rye
She takes off all her clothes
So they don't see down in her eyes
The scarlet rouge and blue tattoos
Are only painted on
But underneath the dark drumbeat
A ballerina dances on
Hard edges hide a tender heart
Silent as a midnight prayer
Hard edges hide the sweetest part
Till you never know it's there"
"Grand-daddy always said when he was 17
He met the girl, the one in all his dreams
And man that was it was it he never once looked back
He found something he just knew was gonna last
And if you ask him bout that day
He'll just tap his chest
And say
That's how you know
When it grabs a hold of you and won't let go
And you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you know it's true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new
He said I walked up to her door
And I was shaking like a leaf there on her porch
Til she flashed that smile at me
And son she took my breathe away
And she still does to this day
That's how you know
When it grabs a hold of you and won't let go
When you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you know it's true
When a new love feel old
And an old love feels new
Now I finally see just what he means
'Cause that's how I feel
Now that you're with me
That's how I know
'Cause you grabbed a hold of me and won't let go
And it feels like you've always been in my soul
That's how you know
When it grabs a hold of you and won't let go
When you feel like she's always been in your soul
And as time goes by she's still surprising you
That's how you know it's true
When a new love feels old
And an old love feels new"
"When I got the word that our Uncle Joe died
I did what we all did, I sat down and cried
Got into my car, headed home for the hills
Back home to Kentucky where the funeral was held
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
The Preacher said Joe was a wonderful guy
And God has a project for him in the sky
His stories are binging the Angels a smile
To turn us into new ways to cheer us awhile
Joe once brought a skunk into Sunday School class
Had even made grouchy old Deacon Jones laugh
He says it's been fixed and smells like a rose
All of you good christians turn loose of your nose
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
At helloween night no one meant any harm
When the outhouse was purched upon Grandpa's old barn
I think of those things when I tell Joe goodbye
A smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
I cried all the way to Kentucky
His memory so sweet to recall
Uncle Joe lived such a good life
Love and respected by all
His jokes were the talk of the county
He knew how to make people laugh
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back
I cried all the way to Kentucky
And then I smiled all the way back"
"[Verse 1]
A million reasons why I could
But only one why I won't
Cause the one who'd probably never know
Is the reason that I don't
I can't say that I'm not tempted
I'm just like any other man
But when I walk out of here alone woman
I hope you understand
[Chorus]
She's standin' on the promises
That she gave to me
So I'm standin' on the promises
I promised her I'd keep
[Verse 2]
It'd be so easy for anyone
To justify the wrong
Fall right into your arms
And say to hell with being strong
But there's one thing I know for sure
She'd never play this kind of game
And for her faith in out love
I'll do her the same cause
[Chorus x2]"
"(C.W. McCall, Bill Fries, Chip Davis)
Bill Fries says that this is based on a true story from the late '60s, when a band of hippies rolled into Telluride and decided to stay.
One day about four or five years ago
We is settin' at the Conoco station
Kickin' tires, and swattin' flies,
And discussin' the State of the Union
When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirty-five hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says, ""Roy, go get your Flit gun""
He says, ""Which is the hippies? And which is the dogs?""
I says, ""Beats the hell outta me, Roy.""
What they was, was a bunch a' them Crispy Critters
And their leader was a space cadet
He says, ""Sagittarius, we has arrived.
""Prepare to disembark, men.
""Get the incense goin' and the sitar out
""We gonna camp in the city park, man.""
I says, ""Boys, let me explain the situation to ya.
""A: you're gettin' me down
""And B: we got us a leash law here
""And C: you in the wrong town.
""You drop one string a' beads in that there park
""And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.
""You got fifteen seconds to get out of town, boys,
""Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars.""
Well, they all got back in the purple bus
And proceeded to the city limits.
Then the telephone rang, was the swimmin' pool
Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it!
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth
(Which is always at the Conoco station)
Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool
To give them Critters a citation
By the time we arrived, it was too damn late
Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart,
And they's after the fish in the fish pond!
I says, ""Roy, you get the one in the silver T-shirt
""And I'll get the rest with a net.
""We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters
""And a drip-dry space cadet.""
[You've watched The Dukes of Hazzard, haven't you? c'mon, admit it; nobody's looking. Well, at this point in the song there's a short interlude which resembles a car chase on Dukes. There's banjo pickin' and yee-hawin' and a general sense of raucous abandon. Oh, yeah, and a few dog barks. It's round-up time at the swimmin' pool.]
Well, we gave 'em hell, but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later, there was nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, and sunflower seeds,
And astrological postcards
Yeah, Critters took over the City Council
And the dogs all barked their brains out
And the whole damn town was Crispy Critters
And the mayor was a space cadet"
"This ol' highway's getting longer
Seems there ain't no end in sight
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holding on this long
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
The competition's getting younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's getting cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old"
"He met her in the fall of '93 in the hills of Tennessee
She was barely 17, he was tall and strong and lean
They were deep in love by June
Hand in hand beneath that moon
And she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On a hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
She married in her mama's wedding gown
Bought a house and settled down
He worked driving all around
All at large from town to town
And he'd come home every night
And she'd be waiting in the front porch light
And she'd sing a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night till dawn
On the front porch all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
They couldn't tell him what was wrong
But they just didn't know
It wasn't very long until Jesus called her home
And he got down on his knees
Said ""God don't take my love from me""
Just let her sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Like she has all along
And I'll dance with her till dawn
On a hill side all alone
And we'll spend eternity like a mountain melody
In love as we can be
Singing that blue ridge song
Now he lives there all alone
In the house that they call home
In his heart there lies a void (?)
From the absence of her voice
And he lays down every night
Dreams about that front porch light
Where she sang a little blue ridge mountain song
And he'd just hum along
And they'd dance all night until dawn
On the hillside all alone
They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody
In love as they could be
Singing that blue ridge song
Little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Singing that blue ridge song
Sing a little blue ridge mountain song
Sing a little blue ride mountain song
Little blue ridge mountain song"
"Remember how time used to drag,
Summer couldn't get here fast enough
You made A's and B's, I was C's and D's
Your daddy hated me 'cause you were into me
Nobody'd ever be good enough for his little girl
Had a fast car and a hard head
Didn't give a damn what he said
I was gonna do what I was born to do
No cold stare, no cussin', nobody, no nothin'
Was gonna keep me from lovin' you
Looks like your daddy was the easy part
How could we have known how hard it'd be
Just tryin' to stay in love, I thought I knew tough
We did some growin' up, watched some friends give up
Life's thrown it all at us, but here we stand
Got a long road, mountains up ahead
Don't give a damn what the world says
I'm gonna do what I was born to do
No turnin', no runnin', nobody, no nothin'
Is gonna keep me from lovin' you
Got a long road, mountains up ahead
Don't give a damn what the world says
I'm gonna do what I was born to do
No turnin', no runnin', nobody, no nothin'
Is gonna keep me from lovin' you
Keep me from lovin' you, baby"
"That's okay
It's alright
No, really everything is cool
This is just
The way I look
When I'm feeling like a fool
Teardrops falling jealous
Drowning in them's just as well as
Drifting on this lonely sea of pain
Could have used another
Night or so to be recovered
Believe the lies I told myself
But just as long as you know
That's okay
It's alright
No, really everything is cool
This is just
The way I look
When I'm feeling like a fool
Voice about us softly mumbling
Words that trip my heart
is stumbling
To the ground and crawls there
on its knees
I'll embrace small shards of silence
To avoid a loss this violent
And survive love's darkest fears
Just as long as you know"
"How do you spell relief?
I get D-R-U-N-K
Lately Dave since my baby left me
I do it almost every day
It's the only thing that I've found
That'll take the hurt away
Well, how do you spell relief John?
I get D-R-U-N-K
Every night about sundown
I get a pain down deep inside
This old broken heart acts up
There's a hurtin' in my pride
Well, I've found a sure fire treatment
That'll get me feelin' right
When your memory starts flarin' up
I just head for the neon lights
How do you spell relief David?
I get D-R-U-N-K
Lately since my baby left
I do it almost every day
It's the only thing that I've found John
That'll take the hurt away
Well, how do you spell relief?
I just get D-R-U-N-K
John Hartford
I don't need no doctor
To tell me what is wrong
I can fill my own prescriptions
And it lasts me all night long
It's the perfect medication
For an ailment such as mine
I forget about the tears I've cried
When the whiskey hits my mind
How do we spell relief?
We get D-R-U-N-K
Lately since my baby left me
I do it almost every day
Well, I tell ya Johnny
Its the only thing I've found
That'll take the pain away
How do we spell relief?
We get D-R-U-N-K
How do we spell relief?
We get D-R-U-N-K
How do we spell relief?
We get D-R-U-N-K
We're havin' fun now, ain't we?"
"She's been playin' them low life honky tonks for thirty years in Texas.
She's sick and tired of all them Reba songs they keep requestin'.
She's about to lose her voice, her hair's fallin' out and ain't nobody clappin'.
So she think's she'll shape her head, buy a boom box and just turn to rappin'.
She can't keep up, with them country healthers,
Gonna learn to shake her boobies, just like Salt N' Peppa.
She done gone funky, a brand new tattoo.
She done gone funky, a big nose ring too.
She done gone funky, her favouite rap song's ""Shoop"".
She done gone funky,
Hah, you go girl!
Well, he never was good at suckin' up to all them country disc jockeys.
It seemed like dag-blammed week, then some new hat act bumped him off the Opry.
He had to sell his bus, his house, his cows: ain't had a hit since the sixties.
Well he's fed with hearin' about: Travis, Garth, Tim McGraw, Collin Raye, Billy Ray Cyrus, John Michael Montgomery, and Joe Diffie.
He saw Johnny Cash on MTV,
Bought a new new toupee, said: ""That's the place for me.""
He done gone funky, too ahead for his boots.
He done gone funky, burned his cowboy boots.
He done gone funky, wearin' platform shoes.
He done gone funky!
Oh, Suki.
Oh well, he moved up to Nashville, had big dreams of being a songwriter.
Ha ha, 'bout the only things he's written down lately are some orders down at Brown's diner.
If everybody's gone country, like Ali Jackson says,
Gonna move to Los Angeles and buy him a drum machine.
He done gone funky, hangin' out with old Sloop.
Doggy Dog, sippin' on gin and juice
He done gone funky, do wets for two live crew.
He done gone funky.
I feel good.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
He done gone funky.
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, funky.
He done gone funky.
She done gone funky."
"I never want this night to end
Sitting here hanging out, with all of my friends
Telling stories, too many secrets for one man to hold
Catching up on our lives, out on the road
I came in on a red eye from Austin
Jackie rode his bus in, straight from Los Angeles
Brady said they got busted, and it really cost them
They'll probably never go back, to Charleston again
Singing come on, singing come on, through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us, coming in here before
Laughing, singing, whiskey drinking, drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night, behind that old red door
Bobby just found out that Shelly left him
She said she couldn't stand how he was, never around
He always played his cards, before he read them
Well he just laughed it off, and brought the whole damn house a round
Singing come, singing come on, through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us, coming in here before
Laughing, singing, whiskey drinking, drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night, behind that old red door
The sun is starting to peek in, through the window
Dominoes are face down, just like Charlie is gain
My sides are aching, from all the bad jokes
It's the kind of night that you never want to end
Singing come on, singing come on, through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us, coming in here before
Laughing, singing, whiskey drinking, drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night, behind that old red door
Singing come on, singing come, come on through that old red door
You know they've seen the likes of us coming in here before
Laughing, singing, whiskey drinking, drifting troubadours
Living like it's always Friday night, behind that old red door.
Yeah we're living like its always Friday night, behind that old red door"
"We're looking for The King
The new Messiah
We're following the star
Shining brighter
Old man won't you help us if you can
He shook his head
But he pointed his hand
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem
I see you've traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
Well I've heard
That a King might come
But up 'til now there hasn't been one
There's a new kid in town
And he's lying in a manger down the road
There's a new kid in town
But he's just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
There's a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem"
"Honey you sure do it well
But I don't need it done
I know if I did it with you
It'd be a whole lot of fun
I'll send my regrets
But I won't hedge my bets
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
Baby you sure look fine
But I don't need it done
So I won't waste your time
And I'll just move along
I don't mind waking up all alone
I found me one real true love
Now I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
It's been one long day all right
Still I don't need it done
You say I could stay all night
Until the morning comes
Well it's not easy but
I've got to give up all you got
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I don't need it done
I found a real true love
Now I don't need it done
Said I better let you run"
"I'm going home (I'm going home)
For my reward (for my reward)
Away up there (away up there)
To see my Lord (To see my lord)
He promised me (He promised me)
In the by and by (in the by and by)
A precious home (a precious home)
Up in the sky.

I'm gonna live right (I'm gonna live right)
To see my Lord (to see my Lord)
And the other friends (and the other friends)
Who've gone before (who've gone before)
It'll be like home (it'll be like home)
When we all get there (when we all get there)
With Mother and Dad (with Mother and Dad)

The time will come (the time will come)
Be ready to go (be ready to go)
What the Lord has planned (what the Lord has planned)
We'll never know (we'll never know)
Don't take a chance (don't take a chance)
And lose your soul (and lose your soul)
Hear the angels play (hear the angels play)
On the harps of gold.

"Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know, Lord, I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
But I've climbed them all, one by one
But this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
My woman tired of the hardships
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy
So this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain
A mountain I may never climb
And is isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time"
"Oh, I've been stumblin' through the darkness
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet
Afraid of movin' much in any direction
Stuck where the past and the future meet
But I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it too
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then
But when I really make myself get honest
It's over and I can't go back again
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind
When I fin'lly got my first good look
A little fire was all it took
An' as the flames grew brighter
I saw everything that I'd missed
Once you get your courage up
You light a match an' your eyes adjust
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge
It's amazing what a man can see
By the light of a burnin' bridge"
"Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my Momma off where she needed to go
It had four bald tires
With the ceiling falling and the windows stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We turned it on, turned it up to 10
And everybody would jump on in
Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio
Grabbed my girl
We looked for somewhere to watch the stars
A perfect place to put it park and take it slow
She sang along
To even the ones that she barely knew
Still sounded good, a little louder too
But we didn't care
I looked at her, she looked at me
I'll never forget that melody
Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio
Hey ya'll be quiet, that's my favorite song
Hey man, turn it up loud
Come on, come on, come on
Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find something on the radio
A real, real good song
We'll know it when it comes on
We had no money and no place to go
All we needed was a radio"
"You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave"

"Down a dirt road down in southern Louisiana
Flew a white Continental with the top laid back
Pretty blond sittin' on a seat of red leather
Dust blowin' out of those well wore tracks
She goin' back
Moss hangin' down like beards in the bayou
Old folks watchin' from a rockin' chair
Ain't no place for a girl of her state
She's gonna ruin her reputation
She don't care 'cause he's waitin' there
She's gonna say
""Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart""
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Bedsprings rubbin' her back through the blanket
Sweat like a tear rollin' down her neck
Watchin' him pullin' down the shades on the window
She'd rather have him than an empty bed
And her self respect
And she says
""Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart""
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Old man countin' his money in the city
Nothin' but the bottom dollar on his mind
The whole situation is a downright pity
He didn't even notice when she crossed that line
When she crossed that line
And she said
""Tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Tell me anything and I'll believe it
'Cause I'm listening with my heart""
Maybe it's wrong but that's the way it goes
When the only love you get is down
Cheater's road
Down cheater's road
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart
Oh tell me you think that I'm pretty
Tell me you think that I'm smart"
My God there I go again Keep messing up when I think I can run the world Once more out here at my wits end Feel like I'm lost again Tossed again I could use a friend (CHORUS) When am I gonna live When am I gonna learn When am I gonna finally figure it out Where I could turn To find sanity When everything goes crazy Where am I gonna go When I need some help Where am I gonna ever find The power to forgive myself When I don't have the love My God does I swear I've been here before Swearing I would never make The same mistake again Nowhere to go but up from here I guess I had a prayer All along you where there (CHORUS) When I don't Gives me the will when I just won't Gives me the power in the hour of my need (CHORUS)
"My Grandma and Grandpa had wonderful hands
With callouses and wedding bands.
They taught me that where there was love
There was always a way.
The picture of the two of them
Has seen me through a lot of years
They were there when I reached up to them
And they're in my life today.
Healing hands, something I can hold on to.
Healing hands, the touch that understands.
Healing hands, I'll always be drawn to
Hearts that belong to healing hands.
You and I may worry so,
To see the kingdoms come and go.
But we've seen enough to know
That it's only love that lingers.
And learning how to live can take a lifetime.
We've got to lend a hand in this troubled world
Before it slips right through our fingers.
Healing hands, something I can hold on to.
Healing hands, a touch that understands.
Healing hands, I'll always be drawn to
Hearts that belong to healing hands.
Healing hands, something I can hold on to.
Healing hands, the touch that understands.
Healing hands, I'll always be drawn to
Hearts that belong to healing hands."
"There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights
They remind him, of nights long ago,
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley marred,
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to his knees,
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not hold
[Chorus:]
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his women's love
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger and fear
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not hold"
"Natural Bridge
by Adrienne Young (Autumn 2006)
Feel like I been riding for a thousand years
Down this lonesome road and bitter trail of tears
But I gotta keep on
Gotta be strong
Emptied out this vessel in the desert sand
It was filled up so many things I couldn't understand
Yeah I did a lot wrong trying to belong
What makes you do wrong when you want to belong
Damn this dead end road
Down again I go
There's a different path that I can see
And it's waiting for me
It's a natural bridge that I'll be crossing over
A simple high green ridge to bonny fields of clover
And there my soul will dance again with my true love and all my kin
The greatest privilege to cross a natural bridge
Underneath the trees I breathe the breezes in
I know it's time to start and I know where to begin
I got to move on kick back and roll on
Damn this dead end road
Down again I go
There's a new path that I can see
And it's waiting for me
It's a natural bridge that I'll be crossing over
A simple high green ridge to bonny fields of clover
And there my soul will dance again with my true love and all my friends
The greatest privilege to cross a natural bridge
Feel like I been ridin for a thousand years
Down this lonesome road and bitter trail of tears
But I gotta keep on
I am strong"
"I set out on a narrow way
Many years ago
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
Couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to
I think about the years I spent
Just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost
And give it back to you
But you just smiled and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan
That is coming true
Every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to"
"Please don't write me letters
I can't read them
Please don't stay forever
Just a season
Say you'll be there waiting (say you're waiting)
Say you need me
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Meet me in the memory
I can feel you
I can feel your heartbeat (feel your heartbeat)
Mine beats with you
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Oh oh
I'll never let you go
Oh oh
We're gonna meet again
At your journey's end
Over the mountain to the sea
You will call to me I know
Over the mountain to the sea
You will run to me my love
When you call out my name
I can feel it
Carried on by the sea
Through the night
When you look to the stars
Let them guide you
I'll be there at your journey's end
Oh oh
I'll never let you go
Oh oh
We're gonna meet again
At your journey's end"
"Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet
Inconceivable that you're a part of me
The innocent look in your eyes
Love without compromise for me
It's a mystery
What did I do to deserve you?
Only God's hands could have made you
And brought this dream to life
Always swore that I, I would never fall
I guess miracles happen after all
And what did I ever do to deserve you?
Unconventional describes my love for you
Unconditional 'cause there's nothing I won't do
I pray as this feeling grows
That you'll always touch the heart and so love me
It's a mystery
What did I do to deserve you?
Only God's hands could have made you
And brought this dream to life
Always swore that I, I would never fall
I guess miracles happen after all
And what did I ever do to deserve you?
I've waited all my life
To hold such a treasure
What is this feeling worth?
There's no measure
What did I do?
You brought this dream to life
Always swore that I, I would never fall
I guess miracles happen after all
And what did I ever do to deserve you?
To deserve you?
To deserve you?"
"Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton 'bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Irwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin' checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland
This is where it all begins (from)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on
Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gary William's sister
On the porch Home Coming week
With rusty cars and weeping willows
Keepin' watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of down home Dixie
Could be anywhere you are (in)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on
As I sit here, I'm surrounded
By these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be (than)
Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet southern comfort, carry on"
"Yes, I'm quieter, tired
I'm more apt to say
""You go on, boys, I'm good
Think I'll stay in today.""
I ain't older (yes, I'm older)
But that's not why the scales have tipped.
Oh you know I've been chosen to be whipped.
Lion tamer, pride life reframer
That warm pot of gold
Always waiting, fear abating
To welcome me home from the cold
It's my pleasure or my treasure
It's the opening that I had so dreamed for
Often screamed for I was as I like to die
And then I found her, and now I hound her
To get mine fully lipped, I'm in love, love,
And I am absolutely
Whipped.
Must be love
I'm whipped and cowed
And I'll whoop and holler
If I'm allowed."
"Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
'Til you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel, I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you wanted me, baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well, I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Ooh, you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine, goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop
You know I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
For I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love"
"All the memories of our good times
Keep crowdin' in my mind
But I'm counting on the bad times
To help me leave you behind
Even though I said its over
I'm really not that strong
I need something to keep me goin'
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
As much as I want to turn around
I gotta keep drivin' on
The road to me forgetting you
Is hard and its long
When I remember how much I loved you
I just remember how you done me wrong
Its something to keep my going
When I'm gone
Still got your photograph in my wallet
Don't know why I don't throw it away
I use to take it out and look at you
To get me through the day
Now I realize when I look in your eyes
I never really knew you at all
Its something to keep my going
When I'm gone
[Chorus]"
"It happens every time I think about the reasons why
I'm sitting here alone at night and not with you.
Heartache takes control and lets me know
Just what a fool I was and how you can't erase the things you do.
And sorry just can't mend a broken heart, I've handed you
Break apart is what most broken hearts still you to do.
But I made long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.
Now over you the sound like some lost city
People tell me how to find it, somehow I just never do
And maybe it's because I never wanted to it all,
Of course now I see that I had the best in you.
That clock just runs in circles, days just go on by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you.
That clock just runs in circles, days just go on' by
Memories hold me closer, no matter how I cry.
I'm still a long long way from over you
Don't think I've ever seen so many shades of blue.
They say the time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you
C'mon banjo!
How 'bout that mandolin in there
All right flat-top
How 'bout of little pedal steel guitar
Little of bass n' drums now
Aw, c'mon everybody!
They say that time will heal
Don't know if I ever will
'Cause I'm a long long way from over you"
"Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request
Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
I ain't got nothin'
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me
Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Yeah, don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song."
"(Dolly Parton)
Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby, if you can't take the heat
If you want it, come and get it, baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser, free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as I need
Easy lovin', that's down my alley
I may be easy but, at least I'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
We might burn on forever, we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that I ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of, stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it, stay out of my bedroom"
"Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're gonna walk down the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through
""Cause sometimes it comes down to
Do what you gotta do
Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you gotta do
Well there's people that'll tell you
It's just no use
And there's people that'll tell you
That you're gonna lose
People that'll tell you
Anything you're gonna listen to
Do what you gotta do
Someday they're going to call your name
They'll come looking for some one to blame
What's your name, boy
Hey, you just tell them true
""Cause they can't take the truth from you
So do what you gotta do
Well, they'll call you a hero or a traitor
But you'll find out that, sooner or later,
Nobody in this world is gonna do it for you
Do what you gotta do
There ain't nobody in this world
That's gonna do it for you
Do what you gotta do"
"Children be careful when playing with matches
Everything's dry and ready to burn Lord Lord
The neighbors are cooking out in the backyard
Just two doors down ain't nobody home (they're all busy)
Building fires strong desires
We've got to be careful there's too many people
Just down the street building fires
Now smoking in bed can sure burn your house down
Specially if you're there with somebody's wife
Temptation knocks and most people answers just neighborly lovers unsatisfied
Building fires strong desires
One two three stop it's time to change partners
You go get your good thing and I'll go get mine
Temptation knocks and most people answers
Just neighborly lovers yearning for more and more
Building fires strong desires
We've got to be careful there's too many people
Just down the street building fires"
"Last night I was prepparing to go to a party
And on the rack with my suits I found the shirt that I'd worn
When I held her in my arms for the very last time
The shirt that I vowed I'd never wear again
As I took it from the rack all my dreams came racin' back
The faint perfume of sweet love filled the night
I could see her face again she kissed my lips as then
And I almost felt my arms around her tight
A shirt that even the Gods must envy
For its arms once encircled the dream that only heavens could bring
Against this shirt once beat that wonderful heart in the whole wide world
And forever each thread shall remind me of her
I rolled down I turned up sleeve and scaresly could believe
For I found a strand of her soft golden hair
I slowly took it down like a star from an angel's crown
I closed my eyes and softly said a prayer
Then I walked to the window sill my eyes began to fill
I thought I heard the soft wind call her name
And the shirt across my arm grew strangely soft and warm
As if I'd reached and held it to a flame
And there I stood hearin' only the beat of my own aching heart
Lost in the dreams of what might have been
And the shirt seemed as sorrowful as I and just as empty body and soul"

I remember when I was a lad times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were tryin' to make a livin' out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singin' loud
[ Both ]
And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor me and little brother would join right in there
Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long we'll rejoin them in a song
We'll join the family circle at the throne
No the circle won't be broken by and by Lord by and by
When daddy sings bass mama sings tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there in the sky Lord in the sky
[ Connie ]
Well I remember after work mama would call in all of us
And you could hear us singin' for a country mile
Though little brother has done gone on we'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

And daddy sings bass mama sings tenor...
In the sky Lord in the sky"
"It's kinda like jumpin' out of a plane
Stompin' on the gas to outrun a train
A ten pound bass on a ten dollar Zebco reel
There ain't no question you're the one
When you come around, girl, here it comes
It's somethin' like nothin', I never thought I'd feel
This feels like somethin' I don't wanna miss
You know what I'm sayin' when I say this
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love
This feels like a gift sent from above
That writers write about, poets speak of
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love.
Usually when somebody gets this close
I wave goodbye and say adios
But you're makin' me wanna, wanna just hang around
Yeah, I wanna be here when the sun comes up
Share a first sip from your coffee cup
And share a last kiss after the sun goes down
This feels like somethin' I don't wanna miss
You know what I'm sayin' when I say this
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love
This feels like a gift sent from above
That writers write about, poets speak of
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love.
This feels like somethin' I don't wanna miss
You know what I'm sayin' when I say this
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love
This feels like a gift sent from above
That writers write about, poets speak of
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love.
Oh baby, this feels a lot like love"
"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again
I'm falling for you even though I know you're only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you're gone
Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why
I'm falling for you even though I know you're only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you're gone
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
Every time you need to take it home
Seeing you there just breaks my heart
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone
Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till you're gone"
"I've walked the streets of small Texas towns
I've seen the snowfall in New York
For a young man, I guess I've been around
But when am I ever gonna settle down
I've seen Grand Canyon and the great Niagara Falls
Had chains on my legs in Wichita
Yeah for a young man I guess I've been around
But when am I ever gonna settle down
I've known girls from Maine to Alabam'
I've loved the Cajun queens down in Louisian'
What will she be like when I reach that next town
Will that be the woman to make me settle down
Well I loved me a Georgia peach
But she turned out wrong
She didn't move me, so I moved on
For a young man I guess I've been around
But when am I ever gonna settle down"
"You're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful
Wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I know I've seen you somewhere before
In my mind behind door number 3
You're a pray you're a gift from god
But theres a bridge I cannot cross
It seems your distant dream
I will never hold you
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I put one foot in front of another
I walk on
Knowing there will never be another
I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shout to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I wanna beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on

"I've been chasing you around
When I go up, you're down
I'm tired of fooling around
Hope you're life is better now
You want to run from...
I can't give up on...
all of my dreams
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take?
I already said, ""I do""
I liked myself with you
but you think it's worthless for whatever reasons
All of my friends
Hope they don't leave me too
How long will it take
for you
I have been here
and you've done what you want
Call if you want to
hide when you don't
I don't care
All of your dreams
Hope they don't leave you too
And when no one else sees
I see only you
How long will it take?"
"Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo
Hey, that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park
'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe, I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe, that ain't what I want
'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
You never know where one might be
There's lots of places that are hard to reach
I gotcha
I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you, baby, way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
Oh, I'd sure like to check you for ticks"
"There stands the glass that will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain it's my first one today
There stands the glass that will hide all my tears
That will drown all my fear brother I'm on my way
I'm wondering where you are tonight I wonder if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me in my misery
There stands the glass fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim it's my first one today
I'm wondering where you are tonight"
"I guess it's just not my day
The wind blew my morning paper away
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
I rented that movie you hate
But that old VCR just chewed up the tape
Then I went to the freezer thought I'd cook me a steak
All I found was that old piece of our wedding cake
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
But I never knew that I needed you so
But now that I've lost you, I can't let you go
If it ain't one thing it's you
If you've heard that I'm goin crazy
It's true
The wheels seem to fall off whatever I do
If it ain't one thing
It's you
Oh if it ain't one thing
It's you"
"I heard the train
In the Tulsa night
Calling out my name
Looking for a fight
She's come a long, long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know
She sings a song
So sad and high
And the Tulsa queen
Don't ever lie
And she don't care where she goes
Don't care where she's been
And the Tulsa queen ain't crying
'Cause I won't see you again
And I want to ride
Like a Tulsa queen
Calling out to you
As she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa
As these ten wheels can be
Lately I speak
Your name too loud
Each time it comes up
In a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa queen and you
Are gone..."
"John Hardy was a desperate little man,
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line,
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
You oughta seen John Hardy gettin' away....
John Hardy stood in that old baroom,
So drunk that he could not see.
And a man walked up and took him by the arm,
He said, ""Johnny, come and go along with me,
Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me.""
John Hardy stood in his old jail cell,
The tears running down from his eyes.
He said, ""I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my six-shooters never told a lie,
No, my six-shooters never told a lie.
The first one to visit John Hardy in his cell
Was a little girl dressed in blue.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I've been true to you.
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you.""
The next one to visit John Hardy in his cell,
Was a little girl dressed in red.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I had rather see you dead,
Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead.""
""I've been to the East and I've been to the West,
I've traveled this wide world around,
I've been to that river and I've been baptized,
So take me to my burying ground,
So take me to my burying ground.""

He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on the West Virginia line,

"Boy of mine boy of mine although my heart was aching
I seem to know you'd want to go pride in your manhood waking
I'll be here waiting dear till at the glad dawn's breaking
I'll hear you say you're home to stay dear little boy of mine
Dear little boy of mine
Dear little boy of mine dear little boy of mine
(Dear little boy of mine)"
"I hold her hand much tighter now stars are shining brighter now
And throughout the day I find she's always on my mind
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
A kiss from her means so much more now I know what kissing's for
The tender smiles I used to know now I cherish so
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
To me she was always just a little girl and now she's my whole world
Music fills the starlit night when I kiss and hold her tight
And one day just the way we planned she'll wear my wedding band
What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving

What a wonderful wonderful feeling when liking turns to loving
(What a wonderful wonderful feeling)"
"We used to have good times together
But now, I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember, how you used to feel dear?
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you?
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go bad"
"I thought I'd be an angel
And fly on astral skies
I thought I'd wear a fanciful disguise
And It's taken me a lotta time
To find out I'm not one
An outlaw on the run,
On this side of the sun.
I hoped I'd be a champion
And live without a care
I thought I'd change the world,
Make it just and fair
But my youth slipped by before my eyes
Much to my surprise
Before I had begun,
On this side of the sun.
Out on this end of the wind
Winter's coming 'round the bend
You pray for rain, before you know,
You're standin' in a foot of snow
So you pull your coat up to your chin
Pick your shovel up again
'Cause your work is never done,
On this side of the sun.
[Instrumental]
I took it to a fortune teller
I thought that she might help me
She looked into my eyes
And smiled mysteriously
But she didn't know as much as me
I stared back, dejectedly
'Cause I know where she's from,
This side of the sun.
Out behind these prison walls,
Dark clouds come and hard rains fall
You pause a moment for a dream,
They row you gently down the stream
You wake up angry in the night,
Jump up, ready for the fight
But the war is never won
On this side of the sun.
Now they tell me music
Can free a person's soul
So I sing a song everywhere I go
But It's not much different than before
I'm still looking for the door
I wonder if there is one,
On this side of the sun..."
"[Chorus]
Memories of you, sweetheart, still haunt me so
Everytime I hear your name I almost cry
But, there's just one thing that I want you to know
I'll love you till the day I die
Oh, we let other people tear us apart
And for no good cause you see
But, I hope and pray you'll be mine someday
You'll live and love each other, you and me
So if you go, don't say goodbye
For you know just what you will cause
Don't leave me here to face this lonesome world
For without you I'm the one that is lost
[Chorus]"
"You may not know it
I don't always show it
But you're so important to me
So much that we've shared
You've always been there
I hope you always will be

'cause you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special to me
When I'm around you
The love that surrounds you
Brings comfort and warmth to my heart
A god-given treasure
You give me such pleasure
You are a true work of art
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
Bridge:
You're the wind 'neath my wings
Like the song that they sing
But there's so many things that you are
An angel in my life
You are the sunlight
And you hung the moon and the stars
Yes, you're special
Turnaround
Chorus:
Yes, you are something special, ooh-wee
Yes, you are something special, yes indeed
Yes, you are something special to me
Mm-mm

You are something special
Mm-mm, you're something special
You are something special"
"Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'll love you
Now that I've kissed you I'll never forget you I know it's true
If I can only tag along I'll do it to be with you
Don't make my heart believe it's long tell me you want me too
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues
Let me go with you and I'll never let you get lonesome
Let me be near you and my love is yours when you need someone
If only to be your old standby having to share your kiss
I'd rather be than left to die craving the love I'd miss
Let me go with you don't leave me I'll miss you I'm scared of the blues
Scared of the blues"
"They're not teardrops just sincere drops they're I love you drops and I love you
They were on my pillow when I woke up this morning
They were on the letter I tried all day to write
And just a little while ago I saw them falling on your picture as I kissed it goodnight
I love you drops I miss you drops hurry home drops you've been gone so long drops
They're not teardrops just sincere drops they're I love you drops and I love you
Never knew this heart could hurt the way it hurts for you
Never lived so many lifetimes in a week
Why don't you come back to me the way you said you would
And kiss these little crystals off my cheek
I love you drops I miss you drops
(Hurry home) I love you"
"When I was a boy, my family would travel
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born
To a lost little town there that's all but remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.
[Chorus]
And, ""Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay?""
He said, ""I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mr. Peabody?s coal train has hauled it away.""
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Aidrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot our pistols
Oh, but empty pop bottles is all we would kill.
[Chorus]
Well, the coal company came with the, world's largest shovel,
They tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Lord, they dug for their coal till the ground was forsaken
And wrote it all down as the, ""Progress of man.""
[Chorus]
When I die, let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just 5 miles away from wherever I am"
"Try not to look so pretty
The next time that we meet
Please don't look so pretty
And I won't act so weak
Please don't look so pretty
You're lovely but it's just cruel
Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your fool
You walk in and steal my mind
But who gave you the right
To treat me like some useless thought
You know away each night
Please don't look so pretty
You're lovely but it's just cruel
Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your fool
You make it hard on me
But I'll try to pretend
That you're just a lovesick dream
That always has to end"
"I'm tryin' not to panic, I'm gettin' all romantic
Gettin' soft with everything I say and do.
I'm talkin' hours on the phone, puttin' on that sweet cologne
I'm even puttin' down the toilet seat for you.
Aw, wait a minute, it gets worse.
I found myself holdin' your purse, standin' outside that bra and panty store.
My boss's wife walked by, she spotted me and told me hi
And I knew then, I was in for it for sure.
Now all the boys down at the shop know and they sure do find it funny.
They say you've changed my ways and that you're spending all my money, honey.
Chorus:
If you're not in love,
If you're not in love,
If you're not in love,
Aw, if you're not in love,
Then I'm in a lot of trouble.
I got this lump in my throat, then I sold my boat
So I could buy this diamond ring for you.
Now I'm hopin' and I'm wishin' that since I can't go fishin',
You won't make me sell my golf clubs, too.
The boys down at the shop know and they laugh until I cry
I told 'em, if I mess this up, my momma's gonna tan my hide.
Chorus
I gave up that can of Snuff, no more NASCAR on TV.
Honey, if that ain't enough, this may be the death of me.

Another lonely motel room another lonely night
I gotta ride on a bronc called Certain Doom and I need to show 85
Money's tight and mornings are rough cause at night I toss and turn
Thinkin' I should change my course and head on home to here
And I'm wonderin' if I'm broken down
Thinkin' I should turn around
Pick up my belongings and go home
But there's something I feel down inside
Must be damned old foolish pride
And the dream of ridin' some day in the Dome
Keeps me comin' back each time
Me and my crazy old mesquite cowboy mind
Another 7-second ride just a second shy of the rent
She's searching through the mail at home for the check I never sent
Lately I've been gettin' thrown landin' hard and tastin' dirt
But it's not broken bones it's a broken heart that's causin' me to hurt"
"Two young cowboys went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge they rested as they went up on their way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed sheep they saw
A plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
His heart was black and shiny and his hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw his Rider coming hard and he heard his joyful cry
Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Yippie yi yay, yippie yi ooh
Ghost Riders in the sky"

"You treat love like a game
But you don't play by any rules
You keep an ace held up your sleeve
For any unsuspectin' fool
I thought I would be different
So I did not expect
That to you I'd be another
Heart in the deck
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
Like a riverboat gambler
Someday you'll lose your touch
To a smooth operator
Who cheats you out of love
When your diamonds turn to teardrops
When your gold begins to rust
It's then you will know this feeling
Of running out of trust I'm
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
I can't take anymore
Of what you're not giving me
I can live with a lot
But I don't want to be
Just another heart
For you to shuffle around
Just a little part
Of a bigger game that's going down
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
I don't like this deal
So I'll get out while I still can
'Cause I don't want to be
Just another heart in your hand
You treat love like a game
But your don't play by any rules"
"He rode up on a winter day
Steam risin' off a streak face bay
Said you probably know my name
If you don't it's Arkansas Dave
He talked of fifteen years ago
And how he got the bay he rode
He said he killed a man in Ohio
First man he killed, first horse he stole
It was a long road for Arkansas Dave
He shot and left him where he laid
He said he'd never forget that winter day
He rode off on a streak faced bay
I stood up and I shook his hand
Told no one that I knew this man
Started thinkin' of a plan
Bout how I'd deal him his last hand
Didn't take him long to come unwound
He jumped up and gunned two men down
Ran outside to leave the town
But ole bay was nowhere to be found
I head out with my forty-four
And when he walked back through the door
I shot till I could shoot no more
And Dave Rudabough fell to the floor
It was the end of the road for Arkansas Dave
I shot and left him where he laid
I'll never forget that winter day
I rode off on a streak faced bay
No I'll never forget that winter day
When I rode home on Daddy's streak face bay"
"It keeps running down the tear-stained face
Of this lonely town and I drown
And I keep reaching for one good reason
Why you said goodbye and turned around
Oh, you're leavin me in this empty state
And all I see are dark clouds as you drive away
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears
Oh, its pourin down and my heart thinks its dyin
Mississippis cryin, Mississippis cryin
The night keeps looking for headlights
Shining in this driveway but they dont shine
And I keep thinkin this crazy storm will
Drive you home but not this time
Oh, my only wish is to change the weather
Are you comin back or is it gonna rain forever?
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears
Oh, its pourin down and my heart thinks its dyin
Mississippis cryin, Mississippis cryin
Where you goin, baby?
Whats in Tennessee?
You never said a word about Memphis
So who is she?
It keeps running down the tear-stained face
Of this lonely town and I drown
Mississippis cryin, baby
Mississippis sad
I think we just figured out
That you aint comin back
The sky can see you leavin
And it cant hold back the tears
Mississippi, Mississippi
Mississippis cryin, Mississippis cryin"
"Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the Shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky Shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the Shepard boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light"
"The windmills and the water tanks all stand on solid ground
The country mailman mutters as he motors into town
The sunlight came, the sunlight went, the stars came out to see
The way I laughed at the way I cried at the way you treated me
The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams, you've never seen me cry
The windshield and the radio play sadly through the night
A crazy blazin' fallin' star just passed me on the right
The tail lights down the highway fade low and out of sight
And that farmer's dog can only bark but this cold north wind can bite
The ocean babe is watered down but these plains are high and dry
And though you've seen your share of dreams, you've never seen me cry"
"I was fifteen when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard when my face turned green
He said ""You come from a long line of sinners like me""
Now me and my brother go to see him some times
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D.
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
So she had two more just like him
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me
Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own
And when the doctor smacks him, he'll probably take a swing
'Cause he'll come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
On the day I die
I know where I'm gonna go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates til his face I see
And stand in a long line of sinners like me
I'll stand in a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de dah de dah
La de dah dah de de
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me"
"Tonight with another I'm dancing and we're smiling at the rest of the crowd
But I can't help wondering about you and your new love to whom you're so proud
At night I'm never alone I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
And I'm afraid that you will be gone I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you gave me you signed it with love you'll recall
And the one of me that you wanted isn't now hanging face to the wall
At night I'm never alone
As long as I can keep smiling maybe I can fool the world don't you see
And perhaps some day I'll forget you and lose this heartache that you left with me
At night I'm never alone"
"We've only known each other since the moment we met
But it seems like forever to me
I haven't figured out the perfect way to say it yet
But I suppose at times like these
A man should get down on his knees
[Chorus]
How'd ya like to be in my wedding?
(And) how'd ya like to walk down the aisle?
You could be the center of attention
Everyone would look at you and smile
We could send our friends invitations
You could wear a long white dress
If you'd like to be in my wedding, darlin'
All ya have to do is say, 'Yes'
Your folks could be seated in the very front row
And cry when we all turn to look at you
We could cut the cake
And we could strike a pose
Like the little, bitty, plastic bride and groom
And then begin our life-long honeymoon
[Chorus]
Tag
Say, 'yes'
Say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
Please say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
Say, 'yes'
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)
(How'd ya like to be in my wedding?)"
"If it's all the same to you if you don't love me like before
I don't think I'll hang around and let you hurt me anymore
If it's all the same to you if your love has really gone
Pardon me while I walk out pick up my heart and move along
I'll bet you somewhere I'll find someone I can thrill with my kiss
Mhm if it's all the same to you yes and I sadly think it is
[ guitar ]
If it's all the same to you...
Yes it's true honey I sadly think it is
That's the trouble baby I sadly think it is"
"That tin pot town went and spat me out
Onto that Eastern track
My dad he gave me a month or two
Before the city spat me back
A flat bed truck picked me up
And I crossed that great divide
I had 3 good days 'til I spent my pay
Now I'm on a downward slide
Oh I'm on a losing streak
Down a paddle I'm up the creek
Mercy be, I'm on a losing streak
The city don't place any worth
On a small town rouse about
I've never seen so many folks
But so few who'll help you out"
"Now I'm only five years old
I've got to do just what I'm told
Santa Claus is gonna be dropping in on me
Is there something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
Now I know what he likes for a late night snack
For years now it's been bringing him back
Milk and cookies
He'll come and go without a sound again
But how in the world does he get in
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
Try to sleep, it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
Now could there something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
Sneak a peek down the hall
I've got to check now, I don't recall
The milk and cookies
I think I'm sure I got it all
The stocking's hung along the wall
Ain't got a chimney
Close my eyes and concentrate
I gotta sleep now, it's getting late
All night long I lie awake
Till Santa's gone I just can't wait
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
Could there be something I might have missed?
I had quite a few things on my list
I hope he can fit it all under that Christmas tree
I hope he can fit it all under my Christmas tree
[Incomprehensible]
Hid a guitar under there, cowboy hat, bicycle maybe
Don't know what he's gonna do with that horse"
"Finally got that promotion I worked hard to get
One that came with a company car
When they gave me the keys they said son you can bet
Keep it up and you'll really go far
[Chorus]
But what good is all that knowin'
The best thing that I had goin'
Is gone
My good friends come around to hang out now and then
And they joke, man you've sure got it hard
With this house on the hill and a white picket fence
And the grass sure is green in the yard
[Chorus]
Well I squandered my time trying to buy everything
Gave her all that I thought she deserved
Now I know all the things that she wanted were free
And I should have been home holdin' her
[Chorus]"
"Would you believe this blacktop highway
Used to be a one-lane gravel road?
Back when Johnny Cash was just somebody
Daddy went to school with years ago
When the cottonwoods reached to the sky
An' honeysuckle vine grew all around
My eyes well up with memories
Every time I think about this little ol' town
'Cause I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
But everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas
I used to laugh at all the stories
Daddy'd tell me 'bout the mischief he'd get in
Dream of penny-candy an' nickel soda-pops
Lord, what a dollar'd buy back then
When livin' life was picture perfect
Like a Norman Rockwell paintin' of the South
Lord, I'd give almost anything
To hear my Daddy tell the stories now
He'd say, ""I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
Still, everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas"""
"I have a story I'd like to tell broken heart's knowin' only too well
And she knows why I feel the way I do
She gave me love and took it away blue sky has turned to a solid grey
And she knows why I feel the way I do
Well I know I'm a walkin' down the lovesick trails been walked down by many before
But when she sees my side of tracks she'll know I've learned the score
I pick my tears put 'em on the shelf keep my heartaches to myself
And she knows why I feel the way I do
[ guitar ]
When she finds somebody new he'll find out what I went through
And she knows why I feel the way I do
She gave me love and took it away blue skies had turned to a solid grey
And she knows why I feel the way I do
Well I know I'm a walkin' down...
She knows why I feel the way I do"
"There's no telling what I'd do
If I could get my hands on you
It takes a lot to make me lie
But now I know I'd like to try
Now I never know your mind
And how I'd love to keep you in line
I could smile and tell you no-o
But how I'd hate to see you go
Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you rattle my bones
Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone
I sometimes wish I'd left you alone
Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep
Are you gonna be the death of me?
(Hey!)
I could show you who you are
I could kiss you in the dark
I could take it way too far
But I could never win your heart
Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you rattle my bones
Take my heart like a ten-pound stone
I sometimes wish I'd left you alone
Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep
Are you gonna be the death of me?
(Hey!) x3
There's no telling what I'd do
If I could get my hands on you
It takes a lot to make me lie

Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you rattle my bones
Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone
I sometimes wish I'd left you alone
Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh
Damn, you're makin' me weep
Wake me up nights and I can't sleep

"You've gone so far away, my darling
Each time I think of you I cry
I press your picture to my bosom
Then I feel that you're close by
Years have passed you've not returned dear
Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live forever
Now I know you'll be close by
I saw you last while you were leaving
The tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and said dear
Your memory I keep close by
They buried you in a lonely graveyard
And a spot they left beside
There I'll sleep 'till Jesus calls us
So that we can be close by"
"I'm looking for that Lonely Street I've got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and mem'ries meet where's this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street there's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams and watch an old love die
A place where there's just loneliness where dim lights bring forgetfulness
I need a place to go and weep where's this place called Lonely Street
Where's this place called Lonely Street"
"He sends her roses and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
Well he's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her, tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
When she gets down well he's always around and
He makes her smile again
He mends her heartaches, remembers her birthday
And tries to be a friend
Now that she's gone I know ah I did her wrong
It's all so simple and fact
He says he wants her, can't live without her
Why didn't I think of that
Ooooooh I've been watchin'
Every move he makes
Ooooooh I've been thinkin'
It could&'ve been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sings her love songs, and tells her his love's strong
Things she needs to know
He tries to please her, and calls for no reason
Just to say hello
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
And I never will get her back
I did my best, thought of everything else
Why didn't I think of that
Oooooooh I been watchin'
Every move that he makes
Oooooooh I been thinkin'
Oh it could've been different somehow
If I'd known what I know now
He sends her roses, and lines he composes
Things a lady loves
He's there to hold her when she needs a shoulder
If life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left I keep kickin' myself
Whenever I start thinkin' back
He says he needs her, tells her he loves her
Why didn't I think of that
He says he loves her and he'll never leave her
Why didn't I think of that"
"In the great book of John you'll wonder the day
When you'll be laid beneath the cold clay
The angel of death will come from the sky
And claim up your soul when the day comes to die
When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death
When the lights all grow dim and the dark shadows creep
And your loved ones have gathered to weep
Can you face them and say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death
When the angel of death comes down after you
Can you smile and say that you have been true
Can you truthfully say with your dying breath
That you're ready to meet the angel of death"
"(Oh the last foxhole oh the last foxhole) oh Lord let it be the last foxhole
He lived by my side on an Island in the sea a place called Okeinawa and just like me
He was fighting in the army against Japan
Our home was a foxhole made of clay blood and sand
(Oh the last foxhole oh the last foxhole) oh Lord let it be the last foxhole
Soon the war was over we went our seperate ways
He went home to Brooklyn but in the army I chose to stay
Now he often wrote me the letters and told me about his fears
That when his son became a man would he had to live
(In an old last foxhole in an old last foxhole) oh Lord let it be the last foxhole
Then came Korea and they sent my company and that same Brooklyn boy
Right back with me
But I left him there in the grave deep and cold
They just covered him up in his last foxhole
(Oh the last foxhole oh the last foxhole) oh Lord let it be the last foxhole
Well the years went by now here I am in another foxhole in VietNam
And there's a boy from Brooklyn behind a gun
They couldn't send his daddy so they sent his son
(The last foxhole the last foxhole) oh Lord let it the the last foxhole"
"Be driving a green van
And watch the Mexicans scatter
Be the first to admit
He thought it was funny as hell
Now he's taken to flipping off hippies
At the river
Yeah, I never really liked him
But I would never tell
Then again I never did understand me
But then again I never did understand me
I have bitten my tongue till I can taste the blood
And I scream, ""Uncle"" When you twist my arm
Yeah, I could say I was just too young
But I haven't yet learned to trust my bleeding heart
But then again I never did understand me
But then again I never did understand me
Just to keep the peace and quiet
I forfeit my peace of mind
Then again I never did understand me
Come for me and I'll be your canary
And stay till the end till it's bad for my health
Yeah, I can forgive every Tom, Dick or Harry
But when it comes down to me I can't forgive myself
But then again I never did understand me
But then again I never did understand me
And just to keep the peace and quiet
I forfeit my peace of mind
Then again I never did understand me
I lift myself up for you to wear me down
And I do it every day as crazy as it seems
It's such a little thing like when I catch my reflection
I think girl, don't you know you shouldn't wear those jeans
But then again I never did understand me
But then again I never did understand me
And just to keep the peace and quiet
I forfeit my peace of mind
Then again I never did understand

"Your hunger after money
Your parents agree
The things you don't require
You kid yourself you need
Neglect the flower of love
Give your worship to the weed
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
The selfishness that drives
So much of what you do
That a fixes your attention
Completely up on you
Your record is take away much more than your due
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
A heavy chain gets heavier
Day by day
It keeps you anchored to the ground
So that your heart cant fly a way
The whiskey and the women
You use to blow your mind
Are deadly on their own
And double deadly when combined
They satisfy your senses but leave your soul behind
Your just adding links to a long and heavy chain
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
The heavy chain gets heavier
Day by day
It keeps you anchored to the ground
So that your heart cant fly a way
A heavy chain gets longer all the time
What should be easy going
Turns into a mountain climb
A heavy chain gets heavier

"I walk alone, where once we wandered
It seems so strange that you are gone
'Til you return I'll stay the same dear
I'll still be true, And walk alone
Chorus
Flame of love is brightly burning
I know that i'm your very own
'til you return I'll stay the same dear
I'll still be true
and walk alone."
"Well, it was all
That I could do to keep from crying'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me charlie pride
And you don't have to call me Merle haggard/anymore
Even though you're on my fighting' side
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name
Well, I've heard my name
A few times in your phone book (hello, hello)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know
I'll hear ""David Allan Coe""
Is when Jesus has his final judgment day
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name
Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter
And I told him it was not the perfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama,
Or trains,
Or trucks,
Or prison,
Or getting' drunk
Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song
And he sent it to me,
And after reading it,
I realized that my friend had written the perfect
Country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here:
Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standing' in the rain
No, a' you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me
Well I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name"
"This is the third night in a row
We've been cruising the town
Windows down, singing songs
Just driving around
My buddies think I'm crazy
Hell, I might be maybe
But that's okay baby
Whatcha say?
Come on fall into me, into my arms
Let me wrap you up with this southern boy charm
Hey bae, whatcha say?
Girl you got a way
Of making me wanna take the long way home
while we hugging and kissing, getting the loving turned on
I need ya bad you see
The things you do to me
If you're feeling what I'm feeling hop on out of that shotgun seat
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Give me a shot of them sweet pink lemonade lips
That's it, don't quit
Girl it's right on hit
You could be my country dime
I wanna make you mine
You're so fine, I ain't lyin'
Don't you think it's time to
Fall into me, into my arms
Let me wrap you up with this southern boy charm
Hey bae, what you say?
Girl you got a way
Of making me wanna take the long way home
while we hugging and kissing, getting the loving turned on
I need ya bad ya see
The things you do to me
If you're feeling what I'm feeling hop on out of that shotgun seat
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me"
"I was sitting on the sofa in my music row apartment
Opening up a letter from my best friend, Silus Blue
He included last week's issue of our tiny hometown paper
With a note that said he finally got his picture in the news
So I started on the front page with the mayor and the bar chief
Driving big old tractors in the founder's day parade
And a story about the JC's annual bake sale at the bar home
Raising money for the orphans, selling cookie and [Incomprehensible]
Got the farming boat, the high school sports
Fishing news and bowling scores
The weather and the ladies' gossip too
Who's left town and who's come home
Who's been born and who's passed on
Who's divorced and who's married who
In the Hickory Hollow Times & County News
It's reported Henry Johnson was seen courting the widow Jackson
Outside in the moonlight on the Moose Lodge patio
Sue Walker said she saw him holding hands in church on Sunday
Holding hands in church reminds me of my old sweetheart, Betty Joan
And right there on the next page grinning like a parson
My old buddy, Silus, in his tux and cowboy boots
And standing close beside him in her bridal gown and diamonds
Betty Joan, my high school sweetheart, the new Mrs. Blue
Got the farming boat, the high school sports
Fishing news and bowling scores
The weather and the ladies' gossip too
Who left town and who's come home
Who's been born and who's passed on
Who's divorced and who's married who
In the Hickory Hollow Times & County News
And you know it makes me happy to see 'em happy too

"Once, I lived a life of wine and roses
I drank a lot back then for one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought, my social friend would help me make the turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
For I kept the wine and threw away the rose
I stood by and watched, the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the one I planned
And I watched my social standings slip away from me
As I slowly watched the bottle take command
And now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses
A victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses"
"I'm as sad as a bird that can't sing I'm lonely as a bell that can't ring
I'm blue as the sky up above I'm just someone with no one to love
No one no one I'm just someone with no one to love
I'm as sad as a leaf in the wind I'm lonely as a man with no friend
I'm cold as a hand with no glove I'm just someone with no one to love
No one no one I'm just someone with no one to love
I'm just someone with no one to love"
"My fondest memories didn't happen on sunny days
Cause when that summer sun was a-beating down
It was all work and no play
Daddy wasn't the only one who used to pray for rain
When the smell of a storm would fill the air
I'd put that farm in my rear view mirror
As the rain soaked the ground, it was too wet to plow
I'd drive down that muddy road, wipers barely keepin' up
She'd be waiting on the front porch, watching for my truck
We'd head for that old boxcar abandoned on the tracks
While they were riding out the weather back on the farm
There we were on a bed of straw
Breaking new ground, it was too wet to plow
And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for
Now when I hear thunder I still wonder
What she thinks about when it's too wet to plow
The strangest thing happened to me just the other day
I saw a storm from moving in, when my telephone rang
On the other end of the line was a voice I'd heard before
She said if you wanna know who this is talking
Meet down by the railroad crossing
Baby, look at those clouds, oh, it's too wet to plow
And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for
Now when I hear thunder I don't have to wonder
What she thinks about when it's too wet to plow
Now when I hear thunder I don't have to wonder
What she thinks about when it's too wet to plow
Too wet to plow"
"If you gather 'round me, people
This story I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well
It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
And into town they rode
Well the deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down
Well they took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
And every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
And he took to the hills and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door
Well there's many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid the mortgage
And saved their little homes
Others tell you of a stranger
That comes to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
He left a thousand dollar bill
Was in Oklahoma City
Was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say
Well, you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
While here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief
Well, as through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with their six-gun
And some with a fountain pen
But it's through this world you ramble
And it's through this world you roam
You won't never see no outlaw
Drive a family from their home"
"Why should I feel disgrace and why should the shadows come
Why should my heart feel lonely and long for a heavenly home
When Jesus is my fortress and my constant frantisy
His eye is on the sparrow and I know he cares for me
His eye is on the sparrow and I know God watches over me
I sing because my soul is happy and I sing because I'm free
For his eye is on the sparrow and I know God watches over me
Yes I sing because my soul is happy and I sing because I'm free
For his eye is on the sparrow and I know God watches over you and me"
"When dark of night makes way for the early sun to rise
It's piece of mind that only love can bring
And with the golden sunlight drifting through the morning skies
Your tender touch makes me know that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing and love can keep you safe and warm
A newborn baby nestled in its mother's arms
Love is a gentle thing and like winter's very first snow falling
And love can be a shelter in a storm
The times when I'm uncertain and get restless in my mind
I'm left alone without a song to sing
But when you come to me at night and pull me to your side
Without a word you tell me that love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing
Love is a gentle thing"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
So may the best woman win"
"Why should I cry over you dear when you never cried over me
You want to take without giving that's why our hearts disagree
You called our dream world a prison but from now on you'll be free
Why should I cry over you dear when you never cried over me
[ steel ]
Why should I cry over you dear..."
"I'll be your companion
Stay right here by your side
And I will never let go
Until the day you die
Here 'til the end
The best love you'll find
If you'll just hold me
Some say I'm trouble
From the first touch of your hand
But I can bring you comfort
And I'll always understand
I'll quench your thirst
In the desert sand
If you'll just hold me
Oh, I am just a bottle
And I'm only made of glass
But I am full of courage
To help you forget the past
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh, with your help I can rule your life
If you'll just hold me
Temptation is my Kingdom
And I rule it day and night
Oh, I can take two wrongs you've done
And make them seem alright
I'll conceal the truth
'Til you believe a lie
If you'll just hold me
Oh, I am just a bottle
And I'm only made of glass
But I am full of courage
To help you forget the past
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh, with your help I can rule your life
If you'll just hold me
I'll be strong when you're weak
If you'll give me a try
Oh, I can be the last love of your life
If you'll just hold me
If you'll just hold me
Won't you hold me?
Oh, please hold me"

"You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him oh but I don't think you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
Women like you are a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over and I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
[ guitar ]
Sometimes a man start lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you oh but he's in love with me
Now I don't know where they leave you oh but I know where I'll stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man
Women like you are a dime a dozen..."
"Our little girl taken sick one evening
As she walked home from school
And in her death bed soon bring her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low,
""Tell Mommy to come to me quickly,
I want to kiss you both then go""
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in heaven on high
God has made room for you daughter,
Oh Mommy and Daddy don't cry
Take care of my little brother
Tell him I've gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left"
"Once those two lips were true lips they meant every word they said
But a woman has the right to change her mind and you did
Twas on a June night a moonlight when you said you love me
But that's as close as we will ever be
That's as close as we will ever be you took back the heart you gave me
Once we planned and we schemed we talked and we dreamed
But that's as close as we will ever be
Once we planned and we schemed..."
"You say you've had a bad time
You say life's chosen you to be permanently blue
Say your lonely you're not the only one
You say love was a sweet dream
That can never come true
That's how I feel about you
If you're lonely you're not the only one
Who am I that you should try and
See me through your pain
Walk a little in my rain
If you're lonely you're not the only one
You say dreams become nightmares
When you wake up and find
They were all in your mind
You're still lonely
You're not the only one"
"I've got just enough love for one woman
Not just any woman will do
I've got just enough love for one woman
And that one woman is you
Love's like it should be but I knew it would be
You're the answer to my dreams
God helped me choose you, I don't want to lose you
Found out what love really means
'Cause I've got just enough love for one woman
Not just any woman will do
I've got just enough love for one woman
And that one woman is you
Heaven must miss you, I can't resist you
When you look at me that way
I'm happy around you, so glad that I've found you
You'll always be my lucky day"
"I don't want you to cry cause I'm leavin' don't want you to cry cause I'm blue
Only my thoughts make me lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
[ fiddle - dobro ]
Why should two lovers quarrel why should they be so untrue
I know what it means to be lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
How would you like be lonesome when someone is through with you
My heart is sad and lonesome wonder if you're lonesome too
Wonder if you're lonesome too
[ banjo - harmonica ]
Now give me your right hand honey I'll say this prayer with you
I'll be so lonesome without you will you be lonesome too
Will you be lonesome too
How would you like be lonesome..."
"See the sun how bright it is this morning take a look at all those skies of blue
See the pretty flowers how they're blooming
It will be a grand world when I get over you
See the dewdrops watch them how they glisten
Feel that tender breeze tiptoeing through
Hear the songs the little birds are singing it will be a grand world when I get over you
But my life doesn't dwell oh anything forlorn
I can't see to find my way around now that you're gone
See the little children hear them laughing
And I wonder do you hear those night winds too
Somewhere that moon's a shining down on lovers
It will be a grand world when I get over you
Yes it's such a grand world but I can't get over you"
"Remember the nights we would jam in the motels
After the honky tonks closed
No one had credit
And no one had no place to go.
Just crazy kids with 'lectric machines
And some soul
Turnin' them crowds on
By playin' some loud rock'n roll.
Then came the man with a suit and a tie
And the promise of contracts and bread
With all our joy he gave us to fame and fortune
That left us half dead.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs.
Comin' down's hard when you find
That you just can't sing it no more
Your emerald ring with the solid gold band
Reflects back the face of a whore.
Freddie would play on his guitar all day
And sometimes his firgers would bleed
Sam would ride on his drum
Like a magnificent steed.
Ben on the bass would make the thunder
And the lighting with love
And I'd sing the lyric of life
That I felt the part of.
Then came the money and Freddie dropped out
To start him a band of his own
Sam bought a frenchise and Bennie OD'd
And I'm soon the label alone.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs.
Goin' up's easy
When you got the song
That comes from the depth of the soul
Where it really belongs..."
"Coctails tore up my family coctails tore down my home
One to wake me up every morning one with a buddy at noon
One for the road every evening till I found out pretty soon
It took two to wake me up every morning two with my buddy at noon
Two for the road every evening till I guess what happened pretty soon
Coctails tore up my family coctails tore down my home
I cheated and I lied swallowed my pride (and then) washed it down with coctails
[ piano ]
I had a house on a hillside the car I was driving was new
I had money in my pockets look what liquor led me to
I started running round with a woman turned my back on my wife and my kids
Wonder how mom was gonna tell 'em the awful thing that daddy did
Coctails tore up my family...
Coctails tore up my family..."
"When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
My head is in a spin since she left me behind
I went to see a gypsy and to have my fortune read
I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read
It nearly drove me crazy when she said what she said
Oh I can tell you people the news was not so good
I can you the people the news was not so good
She said your baby's left you this time she's gone for good uh uh uh"
"You were a friend to me when my wheels were off the track
And though you say there is no need I intend to pay you back
When my mind was turning loose and all my thoughts were turning black
You shined a light on me and I intend to pay you back
But I still wake up shaken by dreams
And I hate to say it but the way it seems
Is that no one is fine
Take the time to peel a few layers
And you will find
True sadness
When I was a child I depended on a bottle
Full grown I've been known to lean on a bottle
But you're the real deal in a world of imposters
And I've seen the program make men out of monsters
'Cause I still wake up shaken by dreams
And I hate to say it but the way it seems
Is that no one is fine
Take the time to peel a few layers
And you will find
True sadness
Angela became a target
As soon as her beauty was seen
By young men who try to reduce her down
To a scene on an x-rated screen
Is she not more than the curve of her hips?
Is she not more than the shine on her lips?
Does she not dream to sing and to live and to dance down her own path?
Without being torn apart
Does she not have a heart?
I cannot go on with this evil inside me
I step out my front door and I feel it surround me
Just know the kingdom of God is within you
Even though the battle is bound to continue
'Cause I still wake up shaken by dreams
And I hate to say it but the way it seems
Is that no one is fine
Take the time to peel a few layers
And you will find
True sadness
True sadness
True, true sadness"
"I'm old Kentucky bound
Some where among the hills of old Kentucky
There's two old folks I love with all my heart
They're praying for their boy to come back safely
And never no more from them depart
There's a little sweetheart waiting for her darling
With her heart all filled with love divine
I long to hold her in my arms and kiss her
For tonight I'm old Kentucky bound
In summer when the birds are singing sweetly
And pretty flowers blooming all around
I long to climb that dear old rocky mountain
For tonight I'm old Kentucky bound"
"September skies, bodies falling
Never again will you catch me admiring
Those vast September skies.
October skies, hate is flying,
Crimson leaves slowly falling,
From azure October skies.
[Chorus]
Time to kill our children
And sing about it.
Let's all kill our children
And sing about it.
November skies, heart is sinking.
No telling where they're leading
These grey November skies.
[Chorus]
December skies, star will be rising.
Will we heed those lessons ringing
Through those dark December skies.
[Chorus]"
"Everything's Okay (Chris Jonat)
You think you think you think too much
But it's not about when, it's all about what
If you use your eyes and forsake your touch
You might hit for average but you'll choke in the clutch
You wonder you wonder wonderful things
So far beyond your reasoning
You throw back your head you start to sing
But you catch yourself, you get your bearings why did you need your bearings?
You believe believe belief's beyond you
Belief belongs to the blessed few
You divine water and hope and the blues
But it don't mean much when it don't ring true
You worry you worry words won't work
When winged wonders wonder what you're worth
You have strong suspicions and you'd like to be sure
If words make you sick there must be a cure why don't you take the cure?
Hey, everything's okay
Put those other thoughts away
Let me hear you say, at least for today
Everything's okay
(Live so you live the life you're leading
If you lose the groove don't move the groove's repeating
If you come undone it's from the words you're heeding)
You've seen you've seen scenes so serene
Like red makes you rage but you sleep to green
And you try to determine what it could mean
That it's full and rich but pure and lean
And you sigh size up your surroundings
See the colors and all that they bring
You try to choose from all the offerings
You get right rooted, thinking of your bearings but then you start to sing
If you want to improve
Get your mind into a groove
And let it play
All that you have to do
Is get your mind into that groove
And try to keep it that way"
"The candles burning out, it's almost gone
It's not gonna make it, until the dawn
Lying here, have I had enough
Of asking myself, would I give you up?
But I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new
I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new, it's what I do
The bottles gone, didn't take too long
One more drink, and I'd be gone
Laying here, in an empty room
Asking God, should I leave you soon?
But I will always, wwait right here for you
It's nothing new
I will always, wait right here for you
It's nothing new, it's what I do
I will always wait right here for you, it's nothing new
I will always wait right here for you, that's what I do
That's what I do
I'll wait on you
It's nothing new
It's what I do"
"Prettiest one never talked to me
Bought her a coke and Jim Bean
Sting of bourbon on her lips
Big tab and twenty dollar tip
She put her hand on my thigh
So I grabbed my wallet and opened wide
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
I asked her if I could take her home
Nervous my expense account had grown
She put her bosom to my face
Hope my money didn't go to waste
A man can only spend so much
Getting played by a woman's touch
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
I guess I ain't no big bank hank
All my bread wound up in the tank
So I go to bed with her on my mind
And I'm flat broke one more time
A man can only spend so much
Getting played by a woman's touch
But tomorrow night I'll try again
I try to be more than just her friend
She didn't like me but she loved my money
Cleared my clouds and made it sunny
She wanted friends and I wanted honey
She didn't like me but she loved my money
She didn't like me but she loved my money"
"I just caught the love bug itch Molly darlin'
And I wanna play house with you
Take me in your arms and hold me and be mine
I'll send you a big bouquet of roses anytime
I know there's no wings on my angel
But how easy on the eyes you've been
There's been a change in me it's true
I wanna full time job with you
And if that's how much I love you it's a sin
What is life without just a little lovin'
So it's older and molder we'll be
Don't you ever take the ribbons from your hair
Or you'll be rockin' all alone in your easy rockin' chair
I won't rob another man's castle
I'll be chained to a memory
You're just a great big bundle of
That southern sunshine that I love
And my cuddle buggin' baby you will be"
"Oh baby why not
Just take one more chance
And risk all we got
On this luckless romance
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And went kinda crazy
Oh baby why not
If love needs a fool
For it to survive
It sure looks to me
Like we both qualify
And a pair of fools
Will always beat one
So let's play the cards
And get this deal done
Oh baby why not
Bet big on the bliss
And laugh in the face
Of what all odds insist
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And both lost our minds
Oh baby why not
Oh baby please
You and I
Are exactly what we need
So let's throw away all care
Move out on the edge somewhere
Find a place and just swing
there in the breeze
Oh baby why not
Just take once more chance
And risk all we got
On this luckless romance
If someone asks why
We'll say we forgot
And threw our lives away
Oh baby why not
And went kinda crazy
Oh baby why not
And both lost our minds
Oh baby why not"
"Don't expect too much from my poor old heart
You can blame the unforgiving for my scars
You might just be the best that I can find
But I can't seem to forget the tears I've cried
I don't know that I will ever trust again
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt
And my heart may be lost, never to be found
Once upon a time I did believe
In my true love that swept me off my feet
Then the wind of change, swept in the rain
And left me drowning, in my pain
I don't know that I will ever love again
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt
And my heart may be lost, never to be found
I don't know that I will ever love again
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt
I don't know that I will ever trust again
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins
Time has changed me, and left me full of doubt
And my heart may be lost, never to be found"
"Well I thought I was a bad boy
Chasin' everything in sight
I didn't come alive
'Til the sun went down at night
I thought I'd been everywhere
Done everything that a man could do
But I didn't start livin'
Until I started lovin' you
Well I've been to Rome, Georgia
And Paris, Tennessee
I couldn't be tied down
Nothin' had a hold on me
I was beginning to believe
I was one of the chosen few
But I didn't start livin'
Until I started lovin' you
You gave my life a whole new meaning
More than it ever had before
Since you've been my sweet angel
We're knockin' on Heaven's door
I thought the neon nightlife
Was never gonna let me be
I thought that livin' on the edge
Would always be my destiny
I thought I'd been everywhere
Done everything a man could do
But I didn't start livin'
Until I started lovin' you
Yeah, I didn't start livin'
Until I started lovin' you"
"Some Dark Holler
I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be here alone knowing you're gone
While I slowly lose my mind
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going and I ain't coming back
I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be in some big city
In a small room with your love on my mind
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going and I ain't coming back
I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be here alone knowing you're gone
As I slowly lose my mind
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today

I'm going and I ain't coming back
Yes, I'm going and I ain't coming back"
"There's a rumour goin' round that it's lookin' like splitsville between us
But all that talk's just talk
So don't you believe it
'Cause I just got a call from my baby
And she was all, guess what?
We're makin up
Our on again off again is on again
Were makin up
She really wants to make it work
I'm still so in love with her
Forget about everything you've heard
Were makin up
Well I'm the first to admit that the road's been a little bit bumpy
But don't you think for a moment that she don't love me
Take your nosy little nose and get a whiff of these roses on the seat of my truck
Maybe we argue a little too much
Maybe we broke up more than once
Ah but this is the part I love"
"(Dolly Parton)
The man I loved ran a salesman route
Selling goods from house to house
Now I knew my mama would never stand
For me stepping out with no traveling man
Mama bought things that he was a'selling
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling
That behind her back I was making plans
To meet somewhere with that traveling man
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older
But a girl needs arms to hold her
Mama didn't know 'cause I didn't told her
But mama wouldn't understand
Me stepping out with a traveling man
Mama didn't allow me a'going courting
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't
Oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand
If she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
So I tell my mama that I reckon I oughta
Go to the spring and fetch us some water
What mama didn't know is I had a plan
To meet down there with that traveling man
Now I make plans to run away
With that traveling man on a Saturday
Well Saturday's here and here I stand
And there goes my mama with that traveling man
Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover
He took my love then he took my mother
But I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understand
My mama running off with my traveling man
Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that
You just like my daddy
He run off before I ever knowed him
You done run-off with my traveling man
And I really don't think I ever knowed you either
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man
And I'm really gonna miss that traveling man
Mm-hm"
"For the life of me will her memory keep on keepin' me awake?
This empty pillow by my head is proof you sleep in the bed that you make
Just like a fool I did nothin', nothin' short of helpin' her pack
Wish I could find a way, find the words to say
To bring my baby back
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
Thought she'd at least call to say that she was ok
While she left me walkin' the floor
Maybe she was long gone long before she ever set foot out that door
I guess over time the love in her heart was overshadowed by her heartaches
She didn't scream or shout, she had it all mapped out, and she never even tapped the brakes
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no sign of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
There goes my life down that highway
All of my dreams slippin' further away from this broken home
I've gotta put the pieces all back together
I've got a good thing goin', and she ain't slowin' down
A good thing goin', showin' no signs of turnin' around
If I could go back, somehow backtrack
I'd undo all I did wrong, but I've got a bad feelin' my good thing goin' is a good thing gone
I've got a good thing goin'
I've got a good thing goin'"
"Let's turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut 'em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party's at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don't look back 'cause
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times, while there's still time
Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
And park it way back, fog it on up
Singin' ohh, ohh
Radio spillin' from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hangin' on a branch by the river
That's a memory that'll get you when you look back
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times, while there's still time
Drop down, the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the party's at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi Black
And don't look back 'cause
Here's to the good times, here's to the sunshine
Here's to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearin'
Oh my, my
She's a little bit tipsy, leans in for a kiss,
She's stealin' your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just fallin' in her eyes
Here's to the good times
Here's to the good times and the moonshine
And the blue eyes under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
Well here's to the good times, livin' on moonwine
Loving you all night, under the moonlight
Here's to the good times
While there's still time"
"Deep down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
[ guitar ]
His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights a sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode"
"Pull back the curtain
Let me see the sun
It's been like a long rainy day
I slave and I try but you grumble and you cry
And we can't live together this a-way, lord lord
And we can't live together this a-way.
I set you in the shade
Give you every dime I made
What can a poor boy do?
Yes I work every day and you threw it all away
I just can't make a living for you, lord lord
And I can't make a living for you.
I've got no use for the red rocking chair
I've got no sugar, baby, now
And since she's been gone I sing this lonesome song
Got no one to rock the cradle for me now, lord lord
Got no one to rock the cradle for me now."
"Hey girl, you know what you've been missing?
Me, me, yeah
Hey girl, wherever you've been kissing
It ain't me, me
I got that love medicinal
I'll make you feel invincible
I'm more than recreational
I am what you need
I'll be your slow grind, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right,
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
That good eat, that long drink, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, you gotta have it you can't quit
I got your fix
I'll be the high that never lets you down (I got your fix)
The one you crave when no one's around
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go, hey hey
Hey girl, you don't get you then never
So leave, oh just leave
Listen, baby baby baby baby girl
Let me make you feel better
Please, please, please, please
I'm what you need
I'll be your slow grind, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right,
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
That good eat, that long drink, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, you gotta have it you can't quit
I got your fix
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one's around
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go,
Yeah, come on baby, yeah, oh oh oh
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one is around
I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right,
Get you falling in love at the end of the night
That good eat, that long drink, that sugar on your lips
That favorite habit, you gotta have it you can't quit
I got your fix
I'll be the high that never lets you down
The one you crave when no one's around
I'll pick you up and never let you go (I got your fix)
Never let you go, hey hey"
"Where did the sunshine go why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so where did the sunshine go
I discovered the sunshine in my darling's loving smile
Like a fool I thought the sun had come to stay
Then she fell for another and the sun went out of style
And the springtime vanished when she went away
Where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go"
"Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong
I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah
Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sitting in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise
And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love
Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah
I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see, I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah
Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies"
"[Chorus]
I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the saviors breast
They set a good example for me
And they taught me how to pray
Now I truly converted
And walkin' on the narrow way
I know that if I can not meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity
[chorus]"
"Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
Knock and then door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Knock and then door shall be opened
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this heart of mine
I'll be waiting there
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world"
"It' so easy to get all caught up
In the fast pace of this modern age
Makes you wonder if were making progress
Or just losing who we are along the way
I've been trying to figure out
How to dial it back and slow it down
Can't be as complicated as it seems
The heart of me loves yesterday
So pardon me now while I make
My way back to the simple things
If you call me I may not answer
Might not get back to you for quite a while
I'll be fishin' with my family
Cause livin' in the moments more my style
I've been trying to figure out
How to dial it back and slow it down
Can't be as complicated as it seems
The heart of me loves yesterday
So pardon me now while I make
My way back to the simple things
Tonight I'm turnin' off the TV
Watch the stars out for a change
Sit on the front porch with my baby
Rockin' all the way
Maybe that'll help me figure out
How to dial it back and slow it down
Can't be as complicated as it seems
The heart of me loves yesterday
So pardon me now while I make
My way back to the simple things"
"He's the King of kings
I stood upon a lonely mountain side
When suddenly a vision came to me
I saw Golgota's Hill where Jesus died
To give men hope for immortality
I thought do we appreciate for call
The cruel suffering crucification brings
Kneel down and pray before your chance is lost
For He is the King of kings
I stood beside a river deep and wide
And watched its waters flow out to the sea
And I thought why do we let our selfish pride
Fill our lives with shame and misery"
"Who's the greatest singer in the land (you are)
Who's the world's most sweetest kindest man (you are)
Who's gonna give you some ice-cream
If you sing this song just right (you are) Yep! That's right!
Now who's the handsomest man in Tennessee (you are)
And who's the trunk of this old family tree (you are)
And when you kids get old enough to work
Who's gonna live off you (you are) Yep! That's true!
You are the world's greatest father (Thank you, kids)
No matter what you say you're never wrong (You got that right!)
And it's so nice of you to bother (it ain't no bother)
To teach us this ridiculous song (Just keep singin' now!)
Now who's the one who watches while you grow (you are)
Who's the one who wipes your ol' dirty nose (you are)
Who's gonna treat you better than any daddy ever did (you are)
Oh thank you kids
You are the world's greatest father (Thank you, kids)
No matter what you say you're never wrong (you got that right)
And it's so nice of you to bother (it ain't no bother)
To teach us this equal silly song (just keep singin' now)
Who's the one that buys you all your clothes (you are)
Who's the one who lets you sing on all his shows (you are)
Who's gonna make more money off you than any daddy ever did (you are)
Thank you kids"
"What's he doin' in my world?
What's he doin' holdin' my world?
If he's not more than just a friend
Why were you kissin' him?
And what's he doin' in my world?
What's he doin' in my world?
Did you tell him that you're my girl?
If your love is really true
Tell him my world's made for two
What's he doin' in my world?
Oh, don't let me keep on wonderin'
Just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love
Loves somebody new
What's he doin' in my world?
We don't need him here in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend
Explain those kisses you gave him
And what's he doin' in my world?"

Sages have come from far following one bright star
Telling us where thou art from heaven
The king of kings, lord is the word he brings

The angels herald the pietas in the magi,
Ardent wouldn't tarry to find him,
Enshrine him, glorify him

The highest praise on earth
The angels will sing of him, the trinity begins
Voices will ring,	""amen the birth of the king""

"Little foot, little foot
Where you wanna go?
Is your boyfriend in the sticks?
Are you on your way home?
Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
Is it really real?
Is it really real?
Love's no good, you know it's true
I say it all the time
Sometimes he's in love with you
But maybe he'll be mine
Just kidding
I wouldn't do it to you
No way, no way
Little foot, little foot
Where you going out?
Oh, you're always going out
Yeah, you're always going out
Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
When you drink another beer
Yeah, you drink a lot of beer
Love's no good and nothing's free
It's sad, I know, but true
Sometimes he's in love with me
But maybe he wants you
Just kidding
You wouldn't do it to me
No way, no way, no way
Little foot, little foot
Where you wanna go?
Oh, your boyfriend

Little foot, little foot
How you gonna feel?
Is it really real?
Is it really real?
Are you really real?
Am I really real?
Are we really real?

"Another sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy.
I heard you call her on the phone,
Watched you shave and dress and leave.
Walk the floor and watch the clock,
Knowing that you ain't missing me.
Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,
Leaving me to think the worst?
And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?
I'm just barely gettin' 'round,
Don't know how I'm getting by.
All our friends I meet in town,
They just can't look me in the eye.
They all know you're runnin' 'round.
Like me, they don't know what to do.
God, I hate their sympathy,
But I just can't turn loose of you.
But do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you know my pain is real?
It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.
Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
I should leave, I know I should;
I just only wish I could.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Oh, it cuts me like a knife,
You have stripped me of my pride.
What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?"
"I would bet my life, like I bet my heart
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You're driving my heart crazy
I can't hold out
I can't hold back now
Like I've done before
Darling look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to
I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me
How do you do that, babe?
Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
First time in your arms I knew
The way you held me
I knew that this could be
What I've been waiting to find
Darling look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling can't you see
I'd do anything you want me to
I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little farther
Every time you look at me
Every time you look at me"
"We could talk it out all night
Till the morning light
And still not get it right
We could call it by a name
Find a place to lay the blame
And still end up the same
We could go down that road, baby
Over and over again
Even though we know the circle never ends
That's enough about me
That's enough about you
What are we gonna do
Talking about love
Talking about us
What are we gonna do
When the morning comes
When all is said and done
Will I still be your only one
Will the light shine in your eyes
Ever pure and ever bright
From the fire that never dies
Are we gonna stay lost on the back road
Unable to make it through
Always worried about who's done what to who"
"The dawn of springtime gave birth to a new love
For you and me but it was born too late
For we both had been placed in the arms of others
Cheated by the cold hands of fate
Fate has no conscience, no mercy for me and you
And the cold hands of fate wrote the book of who loves who
So let the snow of the winter cover our love
And for the sense of misfortune we'll pay
But we know in our hearts this love will live forever
Cheated by the cold hands of fate
And fate has no conscience, no mercy for me and you
And the cold hands of fate wrote the book of who loves who"
"I wanna run away
Don't come out looking 'round
Too busy dealing with it on my own
He's right behind me
Please God I can't be found
Don't cast another stone
Feel out the night, until the sunrise
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks
And I'm as good as gone
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong
And in the end
Will we make our amends
Just like we're face to face another dawn
And in the light, or when the moon shines
Will you take me on home?
How do I lie awake now
When I know I've got to be moving on
How do I lie awake now
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong"
"The River
You know a dream is like a river sun dry or how
Ever changing as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores and
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide, yes
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord, as my captain
I can make it through them all, yes
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Yes, I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry"
"Now I know, now I know what it means to be broken
Now I know, now I know what it means to be bared
You in the chair perceptibly sinking
I'm on my knees once again made aware
Of the world out there
Grief is a word to describe the absence of feeling
Now I know, now I know what it means to be broken
Now I know, now I know,
Now I know what it means to be broken
Now I know, now I know,
Now I know what it means to be bared
You in the chair systematically sinking
I'm on my knees once again made aware
Of the world out there
Grief is a word to describe the absence of feeling
Now I know, now I know,
Now I know what it means to be broken"
"I make believe I make believe that you're here with me yes I do
I make believe I make believe that you'll always be my very own yes I do
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
I make believe I make believe every time the phone rings that it's you yes I do
I make believe every time that there's a knock on the door
I make believe it's you yes I do baby
I guess I'm all wrapped up in a world of make believe
And yet faith can move mountains and behind even the darkest cloud the sun can shine
(If you'll make believe) if you'll just make believe
Then I'll be there with you and all of our dreams will come true
And we'll both live in a world of make believe"
"Each time I dial your number I never get an answer
It seems like you're avoiding me
I can't take unhappy endings so I just keep pretending
You'll see the light eventually
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
Feels like some tragic movie please say you'll come back to me
Dreamin' of you night after night
I'm havin' trouble sleepin
Your memory is keepin' these feelings runnin' through my mind
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
It's such a heartache, I don't know what to do
It's such a heartache and it's tearin' me in two
You took away the dream I wanted more than anything
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying
Can't stop the rain from falling, no answer when I'm calling
My love, it's so confusing, it's such a heartache losin' you
Can't stop my heart from breaking, can't stop my hands from shaking
Can't keep my eyes from crying, can't believe your love is dying

"They talk about the golden rule but if I'd give a helping hand
They'll laugh and say I'm just a fool I guess I'll never understand
My friends all wished the best for me but when success was in my hand
They turned away in jealousy I guess I'll never understand
Then I found you and at last I knew
Our love was real if nothing else was true
Then I believed in life once more and all the lovely things we planned
And now you're walking off the door I guess I'll never understand"
"Ol Reuben made a train & he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my ran it to the Lord knows where
Should been in town when Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you could hear the whistle blow 100 miles
Last night I lay in jail had no money to go my bail
Lord how it sleeted & it snowed
Oh me, oh my Lord how it sleeted & it snowed
I've been to the East, I've been to the West
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh me, oh my I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh the train that I ride is 100 coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you can hear the whistle blow 100 miles
I got myself a blade, laid Reuben in the shade,
I'm startin' me a graveyard of my own.
Oh, me, oh lordy my, startin' me a graveyard of my own.
Ol Reuben made a train & he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my ran it to the Lord knows where"
"Let me just say for the sake of conversation
If it's hard to think as reincarnation
But don't you go crying for me when I'm gone
Told them I'm gonna come back as a country song
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song
I don't have to save me, Heaven and me
Watching neon lights for eternity!
So go ahead and put it on my headstone
Yeah, I'm gonna come back as a country song
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song
So here I am almost two tonight
Yeah I'm practicing for the after life
'Cause when I'm nothing but a pile of bones
I'm gonna come back as a country song
I'll be playing all night in every hunky town bar
In the middle of a fiddle and a steel guitar
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song
I'm hoping when the good Lord calls me home
I'm gonna come back as a country song"
"For all I've been blessed in this life
There was an emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by the power of gold
With one honest touch you set me free
[Chorus:]
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true
In this life, I was loved by you
For every mountain I have climbed
Every Raging river crossed
You were the treasure I longed to find
Without your love I would be lost
[Chorus]"
"I've got this habit I've got to kick
Medicine I need just starts to make me sick
Shoulders I lean on start to be a crutch
Babe I think I needed you a little much
But I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
You showed me the ropes but there were these strings
Tied around my hopes unraveling
So I took the loose ends and I made a vest
To cover up this precious thing inside my chest
And I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I'm getting just a little bit stronger every day
And the hole I never thought would fill
Started to spill
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get just a little bit stronger every day
I'm getting stronger, stronger, stronger
I get stronger the further you are away
I had this problem but I've got it licked
I learned to tell the difference between a miracle and a magic trick"
"You called it quits
And hung up the phone
Now go love
The one you choose
And my friends say I should be happy
But if I'm happy
This is a good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes
And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues
My friends all say
You're no good without me
They tell me
That's good for you
And they say that I'm
Just feelin' fine
With this good imitation of the blues
You threatened to leave
One too many times
I'm gettin' out
My travelin' shoes
And now that you're gone
I'm gonna be walkin' on
With this good imitation of the blues"
"I'll be your spring
When it feels like winter
I'll be your sweet
When life gets bitter
When the world gives in
I won't surrender
I won't give up on you
When the rain won't stop
I'll be your shelter
Better or worse
I'll be your better
In a fleeting world
I'm your forever
I won't give up on you
I'll be that sparkled light
When your lost and lonely
I'll be your strength
When your weak and weary
Your solid ground
When times get shakey
An absolute in a world of maybe
When that heart of yours feels half empty
I'll be your cup of plenty
When you need a friend baby
I'll be many
I won't give up on you
I'll be the calm
When the storm is raging
A place to run
When heart is achin'
That open door
When you need escapin'
I'll be your fix
When you feel like breaking
I'll be your spring
When it feels like winter
I'll be your sweet
When life gets bitter
When the world gives in
I won't surrender
I won't give up on
I won't give up on you"
"I've laid around and played around this old town too long
Summer's almost gone yes winter's comin' on
I've laid around and played around this old town too long
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home no Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny but Johnny can't come home
Cause he's been on this chain gang too long
I've laid around and played around...
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
Ridin' after me yes they're comin' after me
High sheriff and police ridin' after me
And I feel like I've gotta travel on
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
Want to see her bad oh want to see her bad
Want to see my honey want to see her bad
She's the best gal this poor boy ever had
I've laid around and played around...
And I feel like I've gotta travel on"
"We were sitting 'round the table
At the Tuesday poker game
Solvin' all the problems of the world
Tryin' to draw an inside straight
And Jimmy posed the question
As he played a pair of kings
""If you could be anyone in this whole world
Who would you be
Would you be Elvis, shaking up Memphis
Making all the young girls scream
Would you make a speech that would
Change the world like Martin Luther King
Go down in history like Abe Lincoln
'Cause you set a country free
If you could be anyone in this holw world
Tell me, who would you be""
Hank said, ""I'd be a cowboy
Someone like John Wayne""
Johnny said, ""Hey pilgrim
Blow that cigar smoke the other way""
Said he'd make a million dollars
Pitchin' in the major leagues
Then he stared straight into
Paul's bloodshot eyes and said
""Who would you be
Would you be John Lennon
Can you imagine giving hope with just a song
Would you be the Babe, pointin' that bat
Saying, ""This one's going long""
Maybe Moses, partin' the waters
Saying, ""Children follow me""
If you could be anyone in this whole world
Tell me, who would you be""
I knew those boys would roll their eyes
When they heard what I had to say
But I shuffled the cards and said, ""Deuces wild""
And I told them anyways
I'd be a father who had all the answers
To every question my kids had
I'd learn every word on that coffee cup
That said, ""World's Greatest Dad""
Be a perfect husband to that woman
Who means everything to me
If I could be anyone in this whole world
That's who I'd be
Yeah, that's who I'd be"
"Somewhere the sun is shining somewhere the songbirds dwell
Hush then your sad repining God lives and all is well
Somewhere, somewhere beautiful isle of somewhere
Land of the truth where we live anew beautiful isle of somewhere
Somewhere the load is lifted close by an open gate
Somewhere the clouds are rifted somewhere the angels wait
Somewhere, somewhere beautiful isle of somewhere"
"Rush hour traffic
Always puts me in a bad mood
I got chewed out by the boss today
And now I'm stuck on highway ninety two
Then you call me on my cell phone
While I'm cussin' out a Cadillac.
You say remember Tom and Jenny's little boy?
Well, the doctors say the cancers back
Man its been one of those days
When I been thinking poor me
I got no right to complain I guess
Cause right now all I can see
Is a little angel in a Yankees cap
It makes me realize
It's just been one those days for me
But for him it's been one of those lives
Everybody under my roof
Is healthy knock on wood
Oh but I sure do sweat the small stuff
I don't thank God as much as I should
Tonight I'm thinking about Tommy and Jenny
And how they spent the last four years
All those extended stays in Memphis
All the sleepless nights, the prayers, the tears
It's just been one of those days
I was thinking poor me
I got no right to complain I guess
Cause right now all I can see
Is that family moving back to their house
It makes me realize
It's just been one those days for me
But for them its been one of those lives
It's been one of those days
I let things get to me
I got no right to complain
Cause when I look around I see
Folks that are fightin' for every breath
It makes me realize
It's just been one for those days for me
But for them it's been one of those lives"
"Come a little closer baby
I feel like layi'n you down
On a bed of sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
Come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I want to touch you like a cleansin' rain
And let it wash all the hurt away
So come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go
If there's still a chance then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night 'til we make things right
The sun's gonna rise on a better day
Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go 'round
Every inch of you against my skin
I want to be stronger than we've ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down"
"(Conrad Deisler/Hank Card)
We rented a convertible in San Bernadino
We were driving for driving's sake
Across the tortured waterless mountains
Through the moonscape of Mono Lake
The lights of earth had faded behind
The stars were fat and sleek
The universe seemed enormous
So how could we be unique?
We scanned the voids for humanoids
And an answer to the question ""Why?""
Carramba! What were we thinking?
Cause we were borning to die!
To the aliens above we are just tiny anys
They could crush with their giant feet
They could smash our car and mash us into
A little bit of hamburger meat
So let the wind blow through your head
Your thoughts don't matter anyway
We're insignificant, baby
And we're all gonna fade away
We only stopped in Reno for a very short time
But the lights were way too bright
We got tired of spending our winnings
And went spinning out into the night
In the desert we saw this giant man
Exploding like the Fourth of July
Slowly we turned to say ""hello""
When he vaporized into the sky
We're feeling like a bunch of hothouse tomatoes
Riding in a bubble-pack box
With nothing between us and a big hungry worm
But this canvas roof and the push button locks
To the aliens above we are just tiny anys
They could crush with their giant feet
They could smash our car and mash us into
A little bit of hamburger meat
And then someday the whole planet'll blow
And we're all gonna suffocate
We're insignificant, baby
And we just think it's great
Insignificant
Get it over
Cut our taxes
Make it so
Marfa Lights
Can't get no
Where's our luggage?
Just say thanks
That oughta do it"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland."
"(Dolly Parton)
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow
And pray that I will die before I wake
No such luck
Another day of cryin'
Don't know how much more my old heart can break
Flooded with these memories and emotions
The tears like rain keep on falling down
They say that I'll forget
But my face is just as wet
As it was the day you left this town
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
It's relentless and I'm defenseless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
I can't believe that I can talk about it
I never thought I'd live to see this day
But a broken heart won't kill you
You just want to die
But you have to go on livin' anyway
I feel it through and through
And I've never been so blue
And I cried a river over you
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
It's relentless and I'm defenseless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless stream of tears"
"Oh, the builders of this world have no use for me
While they were praising men of this world, I've been on my knees
But someday, I'll be needed there and I'll get my reward
I'll be a corner stone in the house of my Lord
I'm just a stone that builders refused
They tried to shake me from my faith but I couldn't be used
Now I been scorned and counted out and sometimes called a fool
I've been a stone the builders refused
Now I don't want to be a part of castles on sand
They said, ""There was no place I'd fit but Lord, I understand""
I may not look like much to men but I shall not be moved
I'll be a stone the builders refused
I'm just a stone that builders refused
They tried to shake me from my faith but I couldn't be used
Now I been scorned and counted out and sometimes called a fool
I've been a stone the builders refused"

"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked"
INSTRUMENTAL
"Ain't no hay left on the ground
Gonna join the sun in sitting down
My last bale and well my tail is dragging
Cotton shirt, Cotton mouth
Cold ones waiting at the house
It's time for me to get down off the wagon
Chorus 1:
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
A jukebox and swinging doors
Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
Find a looker, have her hold my keys
And tell her later we'll be needing these
Grab a cold one, turn it upside down
To that honky tonkin' sound
Chorus 2:
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
'Cause eight o' clock comes twice a day
And either way you'll find me chasing strays
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
Shoot the breeze while shooting pool
Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends
The party never ends
Chorus 3:
Hose me down and dress me up
Fire up that old pickup truck
Out the gate and let them horses run
Looky there who waits for me
Smiling sweetly, holding up my keys
A cowboy's work just ain't never done
In the land of the midnight sun
In the land of the midnight sun"
"Look at that worn out rusty engine
Sitting there begging for a spark
Don't look like much in that condition
But there was a time you should've seen her run
Down every back road in Lyle County
Under every streetlight up on Main
You sitting there drumming on a dashboard
Both of us falling like a fickle rain
Chorus:
We were
Cooler than December, hotter than July
Young and strong
Some things aren't meant to last forever
But that don't mean you forget 'em when they're gone, so come on
She had hair tangled as the kudzu
Legs as long as the trails that cut through
Those back acres to the river bend
She had her daddy's temper and her momma's flair
Made people talk but did not care
Try anything once ain't scared of nothing
Repeat Chorus
Come on
Don't mean you forget 'em
I still ride down those old roads
Even if it's in my mind
Tight blue jeans and winding curves
Keep me turning on a dime, yeah, just like the time
Repeat Chorus x2
Don't mean you forget 'em when they're gone"
"May the fruit of my toil be yours love and may the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love
And if I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
And from this moment on may a love true and strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
And may the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love"
"I've got my souvenirs that's one thing you can't take away
I've got all my memories of yesterday
Though you've gone and left me here to cry these tears
You can break my heart but you can't take my souvenirs
I can't forget the day we met so long ago
The first time that we kissed I knew I loved you so
All these these things're burned into my memories
The souvenirs that you can't take away from me
I've got my souvenirs
I keep your letters and I keep your Valentines
Wonder signs of love that say you'll be mine
I still have your picture hangin' on the wall
They're my souvenirs and I'm glad I kept them all
I've got my souvenirs
You can break my heart but you can't take my souvenirs"
"Well, sun up, means sundown somewhere
Wake up, I wanna take you out there
Let's go, wherever it's the weekend
'Cause, Lord knows, this world needs to unwind
So, let's show 'em how to have a good time
Let go baby, it's the weekend
From western Montana to south Louisiana
I even hear the doors are now open in Havana
It's the weekend all over the world
You know, they're snakin' the cabanas down in Savannah
I bet they're all laughing and loving in Vienna
It's the weekend all over the world
So, jump in, to good times and good love
With good friends you just can't get enough of
We're all in, baby, it's the weekend
You know, you're rocking in Atlanta, dancing in Guyana
I swear, I hear 'em singing in sweet home Alabama
It's the weekend all over the world
They're on the track in Indiana, they're chantin' in Siena
Here we are, you and me still in our pajamas
It's the weekend all over the world, weekend all over the world
Weekend all over the world
You know they're rockin' in Atlanta
Rollin' in Havana
Champaign-Urbana
Muncie, Indiana"
"(Porter Wagoner & Frank Dycus)
Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?"
"(Dolly Parton)
The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me
The nights get cold and lonely
When you're faraway from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
These good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me"
"Got a pollywog in your water
Tadpole in the moonshine vat
An' granddaddy-long-leg climbing on the screen
You better watch, you're gonna squash him flat
Boll weevils in your cotton
And dirt-dauber busy building a nest
The red wasp's gonna swoop down and get ya child
Won't give you a minutes rest
(she's talkin 'bout)
Bugs! Everywhere you look there's another kind of bug
Makes you want to get a club and clout'em
Yes everybody's talking bout the worrysome bugs
But ain't nobody doing nothing about 'em
Shooing the flies away from the table
Hiding under the quilting bed
The chiggers running wild in the blackberry bush
Yellow jackets swarmin' round your head
They're coming to get your watermelon
Black ants marching in a long line
They're lurking in the leaves of the strawberry patch
And climbing up the tomato vine
(she gonna tell you about)
Bugs!
Bugs! Everywhere you look there's another type of bug
But if ya live in the delta ya got 'em
Here's a sure fire way to pass the time of day
Fold you up a newspaper and swat 'em
Hey look its me with the DDT
Umm hmm, umm hmm
Ain't they a mess, them worrysome pests
Umm hmm, umm umm hmm"

Better sit down kids I'll tell you why, kids You might not understand, kids But give it a try, kids Now how should I put this I've got something to say You mother is staying But I'm going away No, we're not mad, kids It's hard to say why Your mother and I Don't see eye to eye Say your prayers before you go to bed Make sure you get yourself to school on time I know you'll do the things your mother asks She's gonna need you most to stay in line Keep in mind your mother's gonna need Your help a whole lot more than she ever did before No more fights over little things because I won't be here to stop them anymore I know you don't want this, neither do we But sometimes things happen That we can't foresee Now try to be calm, kids And don't look so sad Just cause I am leaving I'll still be your dad Just remember I love you And though I'm not here Just call if you need me And I'll always be near (Repeat Chorus) Well, I have to go now So kiss me goodbye My eyes are just red, kids I'm too big to cry"
"You may wonder why I never do stay sober
I'll tell my story if somebody wants to hear
There is someone that I never got over
I still think about her often, but now not quiet so clear
'cause the whiskey numbs my mind and clouds my vision
So her memory doesn't hurt me all the time
And the longer I stay in this condition
With any luck at all I'll lose my mind
There's no way to completely drown memory
I oughta know 'cause I've tried too far so long
But no matter how I drink, she's always with me
And I know I won't forget her till my mind's completely gone
But the whiskey numbs my mind and clouds my vision
So her memory doesn't hurt me all the time
And the longer I stay in this condition
With any luck at all I'll lose my mind
With any luck at all I'll lose my mind"
"[Verse]
I gave you all the love I got,
Gave you more than I could give, gave you love,
I gave you all that I had
And you took my love, took my love

Keep crying (keep crying), keep trying for you
I keep trying (keep trying), I keep crying for you
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love x2

Oh, when you came around you brightened,
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile,
Oh, didn't I tell you? All I got to give, baby

This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love oh oh x4"
"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever, when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, ""Daddy, oh, don't you dare""
""He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right"", go
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn"
"What makes it easy to treat people bad?
Some things you say and you can't take 'em back
What makes it easy to run from the past,
like a child runs from the dark?
Which is the poison and which is the wine?
The scent and the colors are so much alike
And how much of each will it take to decide,
when your at the table alone?
Where do you go when it's perfectly clear?
You might find your way but you won't find it here
What makes it easy to sound so sincere,
when you know that you don't care?
Love gets lost
Love gets lost
Find my love
Find my love
How can you tell when goodbye means goodbye
Not just for now, for the rest of you life
How can you stand there with love in you eyes
And still be walking away
Love gets lost
Love gets lost
Find my love
Find my love
Find my love
Find my love"
"You told me that your love was true
Sweetheart, I thought the world of you
But now you left me all alone
I have no one to call my own
Now sweetheart, you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
I never shall forget the day
When you said you were going away
I couldn't believe that it was true
After all the love I had for you
Now sweetheart, you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
This road is rough and rocky too
As I travel on, dear, without you
But I'm still praying for the time
Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
Now sweetheart, you've done me wrong
You have left me all alone
Maybe there will come a time
Sweetheart, when you will change your mind"
"Hard to believe I won't see you again
We were just fighting when winter began
The coldness of our words competing with the wind from the north
Still they make me shiver but in a very different way
The pages of the calendar kept turning away
I have some better words now, but it's too late to say them to you
My dream of all dreams and my hope of all hopes
Is only to tell you and make sure you know
How much I love you and how much I always did
And yes I know you loved me I could see it in your eyes
And it was in your struggle and it was in your mind
And it was in the smile you gave me when I was a kid
Feels like no one understands
And now my only chance
To talk to you is through my prayers
I only wanted to tell ya I care
Every night after and every day since
I find myself crying when the memory hits
Sometimes it knocks me down, sometimes I can just put it away
Down in my mind where I don't care to go
The pain of a lesson is letting me know
If you have love in your heart let it show while you can
Yes now I understand
But now my only chance
To talk to you is through my prayers
I only wanted to tell ya I care
I only wanted to tell ya I care"
"I didn't think you had it in you
I've never seen this side of you before
Should I seem and moved, girl, I don't mean to
It's just that I'm surprised you're at my door
Thinking I could help you
Through your first heartache
Well since you gave me mine
All I know to say
Hurts don't it when love takes its final breath
It's enough to hurt you half to death
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it, hurts don't it, hurts don't it
I didn't think that I had it in me
To ever hold you close like this again
This ain't how I wanted you to need me
But a broken heart takes anything it can
Nothing leaves you lonelier than love when it goes
And if you ever wondered how I felt maybe now you know
Hurts don't it when love takes its final breath
It's enough to hurt you half to death
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it, hurts don't it
When at last your heart gives all that it can give
And the other one don't want it hurts don't it, hurts don't it"
"Ohhh Paul
I am marching across the ocean
I won't fall
The ice is evaporating still
I'm just looking for shelter
You're just holding my hand if I hold you
You don't have to belong here
We'll just know when it's right
We'll just know when it's right
When it's right
Ohhh girl
You're already a picture of my will
You're my girl
Can we try to be here just for awhile
I'm just looking for shelter
You're just holding my hand if I hold you
You don't have to belong here
We'll just know when it's right
We'll just know when it's right
When it's right
Break the ocean into two and I'll know what to do
Bring me closer to you and I'll know what to do
I'm just looking for shelter
You're just holding my hand if I hold you
You don't have to belong here
We'll just know when it's right
We'll just know when it's right
We'll just know when it's right
We'll just know when it's right"
"You know if I'd seen her comin'
I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I thought she'd say to me
It was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I felt like some neighbor
Just some guy she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and
Introduced me to her new friend John
I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I knew she'd say to me
I guess she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone ignored
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I know it might sound crazy
But I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me
Or she don't hate me anymore"
"Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that has made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all of the riches you crave
But if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
Take off the teardrops the heartaches and sorrow you'll save
[ ac.guitar ]
When you are weary and tired of another one's gold
When you are lonely then think of this letter my own
Oh but don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold
If you don't love me then quite don't you leave me alone
Now as I am writing this letter I think of the past
And all the promises that you are breaking so free
But to this old world I'll soon say my farewells at last
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me"
"When I sing for him oh praise God's holy name I can feel his presence in my soul
When I sing for him oh blessed be his name how I rejoice within when I sing for him
As I sing a melody that he gave when I speak God's name in song or kneel to pray
Oh I have a special feeling deep within when I sing for him
When I sing for him in person hallelujah when I move to my new home hallelujah
Oh the angels will be singing hallelujah amen when I sing for him when I sing for him
Oh when I sing for him in person...
When I sing for him"
"She didn't look so pretty as some other I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belong
And it felt like coming home when I found her
She seemed to be so proud of me, just walking, holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feeling warm when I loved her
She brightened up the day like the early morning sun
And she made what I was doing seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to living that I guess I've ever done
And it made me want to smile when I loved her
Some of us were born to cast our fortunes to the wind
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand why I lost her, she brightened up the day
Hmm, when I loved her, hmm, when I loved her"
"The crowd rose to their feet
'Round a diamond made of clay
A little boy was rounding third
But the ball beat him to the plate
Before the dust could even settle
The other team began to cheer
Instead of riding up on shoulders
He's fighting back the tears
I wish I could've won
I wish I knew how that feels
I wish I could've won
Faster than the throw from center field
'Cause being the hero, sure looks like a lot of fun
And I wish I was there
I wish life was fair
I wish I could've won
Sitting there by the dugout
Another boy was watching through the fence
And dreaming 'bout the things that he could do
If he was only given half a chance
Amazed at the reaction of the team
Kicking dirt and pitching fits
He says, ""I know they'd sit it differently if they could see from where I sit
I wish I could've lost
I wish I knew how that feels
I wish that I could walk
Without the help of these four wheels
I'd be as happy as a hero
Just to play the game at all
And I wish that I was there
I wish that life was fair
I wish I could've lost
Yeah I wish that life was fair
And I could get out of this chair
I wish I could've lost"
"Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in a heavenly peace
Sleep in a heavenly peace
Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake, at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, the Savior is born
Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Silent night, Holy night
All is calm"
"Harvest moon
Orange sky
Empty field out of sight
Back-end of a dead-end road
Long necks by the case
Stacked up on Diamond plates
JBL's sitting high on poles
Run a match down the side
Gasoline, stack of pine
Get ready here we go
Tonight we gonna burn it
We gonna turn it up
Bright like a K.C. light
We gonna kill it
We gonna feel it
Till the stars fade out of sight
Full throttle, tipping back bottles
Gonna set this field on fire
Tonight, ooo ooo ooo
Tonight
See the smoke
Rising up
Pour some fire in a cup
Pinch of long cut pass it around
Feel the flame
Feel the heat
Feel her skin next to me
Yeah I'm 'bout to get unwound
Tonight we gonna burn it
We gonna turn it up
Bright like a K.C. light
We gonna kill it
We gonna feel it
Till the stars fade out of sight
Full throttle, tipping back bottles
Gonna set this field on fire
Tonight, ooo ooo ooo
Tonight
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
Ain't nothing I'd rather see
Whoa-oh whoa-oh
There's no place that I'd rather be

Oh yeah we really gonna rock it
Tonight
Are we really gonna stop it?

Tonight we're throwin' it down

Put your cans up

"They say a woman's a fool for weeping a fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness and I can't go on
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies telling me lies
You told me you needed my company and I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears...
[ strings ]
You don't know what a chance is until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man with a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears...
I cover my ears...
I cover my ears..."
"Well you don't love me anymore my darling
I'm just a used to be to you
Those cold cold kisses that you gave me little darling
Proved to me you found somebody new
Tomorrow's just another lonesome day
And I know you'll want me far away
Well you don't love me anymore my darling
I'm just a used to be to you
Gone are the good old days that we spent together
And I don't know if I can stand the pain
Of knowing that you'll soon be gone forever
And I'll never know your love again"
"How do I love you, well let me see
I love you like a lyric loves a melody
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
How do I need you, well can't you tell
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
Every now and then when the world
That we're living in is crazy
You gladly hold me and carry me through
No one in the world has ever done
What you do for me and I'd be
Sad and lonely if there were no you
How do I love you, well count the ways
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
Every now and then when the world
That we're living in is crazy
You gladly hold me and carry me through
No one in the world has ever done
What you do for me and I'd be
Sad and lonely if there were no you"
"I was lost in trouble and strife, I heard a voice and it changed my life
And now it's a brand new day, and I ain't afraid to say
You're not alone when you're down and out
And I think you know who I'm talking about
When I don't know how I'll get through
I ask myself what would Willie do
What would Willie do, well he'd travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks, thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don't believe me take a look at the family
And they'll tell you that it's true
When skies are gray what would Willie do
Well long ago he came unto us, his words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along, but then they didn't want to hear his songs
He was gone and we thought we'd lost him
But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled, they came to hear him sing from miles
Like a miracle all those rednecks and hippies
From New York City down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
When it's all gone wrong what would Willie do
You know sometimes I wonder when I ain't gettin' nowhere
What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear
And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
And he's got his problems just like any of us
Well he'd just take a deep breath and then he'd let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath and let it all go
And he'd take another deep breath...and he'd hold it
Ah and I bet he'd feel hungry in a way that seems strange
Yeah hungry for all the things that he just can't change
Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom
And his wife sewed him up in the sheets and beat him with a broom and he forgave her
And you think that's rough, well then the IRS came and they took away all of his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio, and he just went out and did another show
So when it's all coming down on you
You better ask yourself what would Willie do"
"Every night I go out somebody asks me whatever happened to you
I just say that I haven't seen you lately and then I say my friend I thought you knew
That we split the blanket down the middle cause we could never get along
We split the blanket down the middle that's all you can do when love is gone
Well I tell 'em that we tried and tried to make it
But we couldn't solve what was the use
To hang on to love it's only mis'ry so now I'm fancy free and foot loose
Yes we split the blanket"
"She says she hates to sleep alone
but she'll do it to night
She wants to grab her telephone
but she knows it ain't right
So if he won't call, she'll survive
and if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head, and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love
they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
and he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down;
He said, ""I guess I should have told you before.""
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,
And she don't know which way to move.
She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind,
But if she could bear to walk away
she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself
so apart and there's no one else in her heart,
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard.
She's determined to try
but she'll still give in when he gives her a call.
She'll ask herself why, but in the end it won't matter at all.
Sure, she could sit at home, stay inside
and sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out that door, she feels
as weak as before with nothing to hide.
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,

It hurts to feel like such a fool."
"Keep it coming I've got your back
Do not fear when I'm on deck
A bigger lie I've never told
A bigger story yet to unfold
My only guarantee, I will fuck you up
Another day of pure energy
What wears most is the constancy
A bigger job I've never had
A bigger burden I could not drag
My only guarantee, I will fuck you up
Strange how things come about
Will I ever know how things turn out?
A bigger wish I've never known
A bigger question I'm trying to hone
My only guarantee, I will fuck you up"
"You used to say you wanted someone to know you inside out
And as I look back on things well congratulations baby
Somebody knows you now
All of this time you told me you wished that you could figure yourself out
You say you're still a mystery but no not really not to me
Yeah somebody knows you now
I got a hundred bucks that says right now your hair's up in a clip
Your socks don't quite match and you're bitin' your lip
I can finish your thoughts or pick the right restaurants
Even order for you 'fore you sit down
Yeah somebody knows you now
So no matter where you life's path leads
Remember me somehow
And feel a little warm inside knowin' that somewhere tonight
Somebody knows you now"

"She was cool, she was hot
She was smokin' a lot
At the end of the bar
She had more than one
Too many buttons undone
On that blouse she wore
Starin' too long
At her lost in that Skynyrd song
Was his first mistake
And when she shot him that
'Boy you don't want none of this' look
It was way too late
She's like a needle to a junkie
She's like whiskey to a drunk
She's like poker to a gambler
She's like a bullet in a gun
She's in his blood
He can't explain the rush when he gets with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted man
He can't quit her
Well she'd come to his house
And he'd tell her she belonged just with him
She'd get up, she'd get dressed
Take five hundred, no less
And then leave again
He said, ""Baby, I'll take care of you.
Can't stand the thought of sharing you
With them other guys.""
Well she'd laugh and say
""Well, maybe you shouldn't call me no more than, baby.""
And he didn't that first night.
She's like a needle to a junkie
She's like whiskey to a drunk
She's like poker to a gambler
She's like a bullet in a gun
She's in his blood
He can't explain the rush when he gets with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted man
He can't quit her
She's in his blood
He can't explain the rush when he gets with her
Might be the death of him, but he's addicted man
He can't quit her
She was cool, she was hot
She was walkin' cross the parking lot
With some other guy
Well, he was jealous, he was jonesin'
And he wound up on the wrong end of a .45"
"HEAVY TEARS

'76 Tree Publishing
One day you're happy the next day you're blue
You feel like the whole world's comin' right down on you
There ain't nothin' wrong but then there ain't nothin' right
It's just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night
Heavy tears in your eyes
Lord don't they hurt you when you cry
Heavy tears in your eyes
And when they hit the ground don't they make a terrible sound
Maybe she loves you and maybe it's a joke
And maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke
You don't feel warm but then you don't feel cold
You're just gettin' weary you're just gettin' old
Heavy tears in your eyes...
And your mind can't take this worry and your heart feels underfed
Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow or maybe you'll just stay in bed
Don't call the doctor and ask his advice
Cause he's felt the same way himself once or twice
And there ain't no cure for the tear in your eye
You just gotta sit there you just gotta cry
Heavy tears in your eyes..."
"I'm that little voice inside your head
Look at what you've done to me
You knew all along that you were lying when you said,
All those pretty words and lovely things
You'd really like to be let off the hook
Won't somebody scrub your conscience clean?
But that cannot be done, you'll probably need to see a shrink
No, you can't take a pill to silence me
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection
Your whole life you've done things just like this
No responsibility, no blame
But you can't always get away treatin' people like shit,
And expect it won't catch up with you someday
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection
I am your creation
Your the one who trapped me in your brain
Now I'm forced to haunt you
Bet you never thought we'd turn on you this way
So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection"
"Love oh love careless love

"When I called I heard you say
""Tell her I'm out""
And don't you know I'm smart enough
To figure you out?
You said, ""Come on we need to talk
Let's go for a ride""
But you don't have to say a thing
I can read your mind
I hear the song on the radio playing loud
I might forever hear the words
You felt that let me down
Hey, but my heart breaking
Hey, but my heart breaking
It didn't make a sound
It didn't make a sound
We sat up all night
While you apologized
And I think you were surprised
To see me smile
But all I heard was the sound
Of the freedom bells ringing
I bet you thought I would be breaking down
Hey, but my heart breaking
Hey, but my heart breaking
It didn't make a sound
It didn't make a sound
Hey, but my heart breaking
Hey, but my heart breaking
Hey, but my heart breaking
Hey, but my heart breaking
It never made a sound
It didn't make a sound
It didn't make a sound

Go ahead and leave me darling
You won't ever see me crying
You'll never hear my heart breaking

It didn't make a sound
It never made a sound"
"I can feel the warmth of you against my skin
Like a gentle wave that rushes to the shore
I have loved you since the day the world began
But I don't see how I can love you anymore
When the gentle touch of you is touching me
And the blinding fires of love began to roar
It seems that time stands still for you and me
But I don't see how I can love you anymore

I can see that you have meant the world to me
You've been everything that I was searching for
I see the world of love ahead for you and me

When the gentle touch of you...
No I don't see how I can love you anymore"
"You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
You gave me a forest then burnt down the trees
You preached me a sermon until I believed
Then you put a whole lot of lonesome in me
I just wanted someone to take me you took me for all that you could
My friends all said you'd try to break me from drinkin'
But I never thought that you would Tammy
You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
I bought you that mansion you wanted so much but it never quite felt like home
The dreams that we once shared are shattered in two
And I've had to go on alone Tammy
You put a whole lot of lonesome in me can't you see
Yes I've got a whole lot of lonesome in me"
"Damn this wicked world
Damn I wish that heaven wasn't hidden like a pearl
Underneath the sea
I wish all the answers came more easily to me
Watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, did everything I was told
And I feel like that man
Making my last stand
In the field of crows
Damn the sky so blue
The more that I see clear, the more that I'm confused
Everything I know
Is always in the way of some direction I should go
Watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, did everything I was told
And I feel like that man
Making my last stand
In the field of crows
Well I'm watching as my world spins out of control
And I'd like to make it stop, lord I did everything I was told
Still I feel like that man
Making my last stand
Oh yes I feel like that man
In the field of crows"

Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a man
The Lord must have appointed
To live among us mountain folks
In eastern Tennessee
And he delivered more than half
The babies in those mountains
Among those babies
He delivered me
There was no way to drive along
The roads back in those mountains
But Dr. Thomas got there
Just the same
He often rode on horseback
To get where he was needed
But if he had to walk
He always came
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a friend
A neighbor and a doctor
Though he seldom got a dime
For all he'd done
And I remember lots of times
We sent for Dr. Thomas
But I don't recall a time
He didn't come
They say a man is judged
By the deeds he does while livin'
A judgement when he stands
Before the Lord
And I know heaven holds a place
For men like Dr. Thomas
And I know that he'll receive
His just reward
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him"
"Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
Now, come brothers and sisters and don't fall asleep
But pray night and day or you'll sink in the deep
Fathers and mothers are praying so well
Saying Lord won't you take us in your lifeboat?
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will stand the raging storm
Take me in your lifeboat, take me in your lifeboat
It will bear my spirit home
The clouds are so heavy, the winds are so loud
The thunders are rolling, bursting the clouds
They pray to their sinner mates for what they have done
They took the dying sinner in their lifeboat"
"There in the glow of early dawn
I wake to find that I'm alone
And turn off the alarm clock she always used to wind
And that's when I get baby on my mind
I make instant coffee just for one
I scrape off the toast that's over done
Then I sit there pretending I'll get along just fine
And that's when I get baby on my mind
And all through the day each hour I'm away
No matter what I do I always find
Although we may be far apart
I still got baby in my heart
There's too many mem'ries she left behind
And that's when I get baby on my mind"
"If you're trying to reach Heaven
you talk to Jesus, you talk to Him every day.
'Cause Jesus knows, He knows that you are coming
and Heaven's just a prayer away.
If you go, if you go to church on Sunday
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
You are just one prayer from Heaven
as you travel down life's highway.
Just when you think that you can't make it,
well, Heaven's just a prayer away.
Of, if you go, if you go to church on Sunday
you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
Away."

She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
(In case you ever change your mind)
Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind"
"Back in the days of my childhood
In the evening when everything was still
I used to sit and listen to the foxhounds
With my dad in the old Kentucky hills
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live
Soon my childhood days were over
I had to leave my home
Mother and dad called to heaven
I was left in this world all alone
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live
High in the hills of old Kentucky
Stands the fondest spot that's in my memory
I'm on my way back to the old home
The light in the window I long to see
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live
I'm on my way back to the old home
The road winds on up the hill
But there's no light in the window
That shined long ago where I live"
"Forget about it
I'm admittin' I was wrong
And I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door
Forget about it
I'll split and I'll be gone
And you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When I can't recall
How you drove me crazy
Forget about it
When forever's over
I won't remember how much
I loved you anymore
Forget about it
Put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy
Out there on the town
Forget about it
When you're lying in bed
Just wishing I was there to lay you down
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When you will recall
How I drove you crazier
Forget about those stars in your eyes
Laying by the fireside
Holding you tight
I can't remember when I felt so right
So just forget about it
Forget about it
When you see me on the street
Don't wink, don't wave
Don't try to tease me with your smile
Forget about it
If we chance to meet somewhere
Don't think it's 'cause I'm trying to reconcile
'Cause after all
I'll see you sometime maybe
When I can't recall how you drove me crazier
Forget about those stars in your eyes
Laying by the fireside
Holding you tight
I can't remember when I felt so right
So just forget about it"
"See the ruins on the hill where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten
Cecil Darby loved his wife and he labored all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession
Oh it took three hundred days for the timbers to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground
Though they shared the common bed there was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping
Then one night he heard the sound and as he laid his pencil down
He traced it to her door and turned the handle
And the pale light of the moon through the window of her room
Split the shadows where two bodies lay in tangle
Oh it took three hundred days"
"Needle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me together
For one I can't control it
For two I don't believe it
For three I'm counting
As the universe expands
I'm breathing
For now, I'll try to be good
For once was careful and smart
Forever looking for a miracle
I'm dreaming
Needle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me together
Fortuitous, I met a man
A long tall glass of water
Force of nature brought us closer
Now I wonder where the wind blows
Fortune won't you smile in money
And in comfort, warm and sunny
Formerly I asked for only one thing
Now I want more, I'm asking
Needle and thread
Needle and thread
Keep me together
Keep me together"
"As I walk along,
I wonder what went wrong,
With our love,
A love so rarin' strong.
And as I walk along,
I think of the things we've done
Together, while our hearts were young.
I'm walkin' in the rain,
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
To end this misery.
And I wonder
I wonder,
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away.
And I wonder,
Where she will stay
My little runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
I'm walkin' in the rain,
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wonder,
Why
Why, why, why, why, why
She ran away.
And I wonder,
Where she will stay
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway."
"[Chorus]
I love you cause I want to
I love you cause I want to
Sometimes I wonder baby
Why I put up with you
You ought to pay attention
I've got better things to do
I could be tearing the Eiffel tower down to the ground
I could be helping superman and break the speed of sound
Nobody tells me what to do
And I don't love you cause I have to
[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feelin' wicked and I want to sneak around
Sneak up from behind you baby while you're out on the town
Now if you don't take me with you I might catch you in the act
You can't run and hide and keep your alibis intact
Nobody tells me what to do
And I don't love you 'cause I have to
[Chorus]
This just ain't some game we play, so you better straighten up
I ain't doin' this for my health
I'm doin' it for love, love
[Chorus]
Life is an adventure and I just can't get enough
Love can be so simple it don't have to be so tough
I could be anybody's sweetheart, anybody's girl
I could marry me a rich man and sail around the world
But I think I'll stay right here with you
Cause I never do nothing I don't want to
[Chorus]"
"Waves are rollin' in, lazy summer wind
Sittin' in the sand, holdin' to your hand
I was ten and you were nine
Way out on the gulf shore line
You became my girl, I became your man
Underneath the stars, we were makin' plans
You said I do and you've done just fine
Way out on the gulf shore line
The sea will moan, waves will roll
The sea gulls fly, on the winds that blow
And I'll love you till the sun don't shine
Way out on the gulf shore line
Graduation day, Johnny walked away
Hard to say goodbye, harder not to cry
He had to leave his folks behind
Way out on the gulf shore line"
"The curtain of darkness is fallin?
And my friends are all here at my side.
Are those the sweet voices of angels
As I rise on that heavenly tide?
All hearts overflowin? with sadness
And those words left so often unsaid
Then I could hear a voice whispering softly,
?Could I have all your stuff when your dead??
?Could I have your TV and your pickup?
And I?ve always admired your shoes.
Could I have that old dining room table?
And there?s a couple of chairs I could use.?
?Well, you know that you?re headed to glory,
And like a star, up to heaven you?ll shoot
When they write the last page of your story,
Could I try on that seersucker suit??
It was the voice of my dear brother Thomas.
He was kneelin? down close by my side.
His breath had just come from a funeral
For a mouth full of teeth that had died.
Well, I prayed my last prayer for salvation.
I was feelin? the touch of God?s hand.
But I could still hear the voice of my brother
As they struck up that old angel band.
?Could I have your old ski boots and surf board?
And maybe that four-poster bed?
Would you mind if I took a few records?
Just Nirvana, The Stones, and the Dead.?
Well, you know that you can?t take it with you
To your heavenly home up on high.
When you pass through those gates, and they had you your wings,
Could I have all your stuff when you die?
But the angels consulted St. Peter
And flew me back to my hospital bed.
My life was a new day a-dawning,
And the angels took Tommy instead."
"Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me 99 on a prison farm
In Georgia close to the Florida line
Well I've been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of ol' red now ol' red
He's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged trackin' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators in the quicksand fence
But all these years that I've been here ain't nobody got past red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Well I payed off the guard
And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
Well I'd take ol' red for his evenin' runs
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now ol' red got real used to seein' his lady every night
So I kept him away for three or four days
And waited 'til the time got right
Well I made my run in the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard let red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee and ol' red was headed south
And the warden sang
Come on somebody why don't you run
Ol' red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'for the mornin' comes
Now there's red haired blue ticks
All in the south
Love got me in here
And love got me out"
"Oh, I know you are out there somewhere,
And I dream at night of rolls of chestnut hair,
And I would walk to California,
If I thought that by some chance you might be there.
[Chorus]
And I keep thinking I see your face,
Then it's gone without a trace,
Oh, I been every place I thought you'd be.
Why have I just gone, drifting on and on,
When baby you're the one that's lost at sea.
Oh, I have sailed the bright blue waters,
And I have overlooked an ocean full of tears.
Just for a glimpse of Heaven's daughter,
Before you smile at me and disappear.
[Chorus: x2]"
"(yodelling)
Inspect the silver inlay and the finely engraved steel,
rich carved ivory grips with checkered lines that you can feel.
You'll find it premature who call the calibre obsolete
when olden-time design and modern treacherousness meet.
It's a curio that's slipped between our current laws as read.
Priceless as an artifact but leaves you just as dead.
Craftsmanship like this is not displayed much anymore
and there ain't too many gangsters shooting Russian .44
(yodelling)
To think a learned chronicler like you would be the one
whose eye for detail failed to see him reaching for your gun.
But you must be the first in 90 years to meet his death
by way of antique archaic blackpowder pistol's breath.
Despite your recent injuries you must admit that still,
it remains an elegant and stylish way to kill.
Yes despite my injuries, good sir, I cannot lie -
it remains an elegant and stylish way to die.

"A cowboy rode one day
Down to old Monterey
Across the sleepy Rio Grande
He met a lovely gal
A senorita pal
With eyes that seemed to understand
And as guitars were softly playing
Across the floor they soon were swaying
Me like a you she kept on saying
As he would gently squeeze her hand
She say Me like to talk,
We take a little walk
It was the nearest thing to heaven
To have and hold her fast
That night of love soon past
He rode away from old Monterey
And left her alone to pine"
"Got any plans for the weekend
Cause I've got an idea
Lets do something we ain't done in a couple years
Lets roll out on the highway and we'll wave the world goodbye
Well come on baby how bout we just drive
Just drive and get away
Just drive and run away
Cause I love you right beside me
And the way it makes me feel
When I've got one hand on your leg
And one hand on the wheel
And we just drive
Well pack a bag with some simple things
Cause you won't need much
Just a pair of faded jeans
I love it when you wear that stuff
You can let you hair down
We can loose all track of time
Come on baby how bout we just drive
Let's just disappear together
And leave it all behind"
"Hey, when c.c. rider was just a snot-nosed kid
I was already known for doin' what i did
The women all screamed as i walked by
My daddy would curse me
And my momma'd start to cry
'Cause i was known yeah for doin' what i did
My reputation was strong, hey for doing what i did
It ain't no way they could ever get kissed
'Cause i was just too well known for doin' what i did
Hey, my momma called the preacher, called up everyone she knew
All of her friends
When old Casanova was a just love-sick pup
I'd already broke me so many hearts i could've started me a dump
'Cause i was known yeah for doin' what i did
My reputation was strong, hey for doing what i did
It ain't no way they could ever get kissed
'Cause i was just too well known for doin' what i did
The older boys was teasin' me on my first day of school
Then finally the teachers let me break all the rules
The press heard about it tried to put me in the news
They didn't have no comment for fear of what they'd lose
'Cause i was known yeah for doin' what i did
My reputation was strong, hey for doing what i did
It ain't no way they could ever get kissed
'Cause i was just too well known for doin' what i did
Ahh, it was like i was strong, since i was born
Man, i stood alone
Yeah, baby, i was strong
Doin what i did
Doin what i did
Ah, doin what i did
Hey, when old c.c. rider was a snot-nosed kid
I was already know, baby, for doin' what i did
When little casanova was a snot-nosed punk,
I'd already broke so many hearts i could've started me a dump
I was known, for doin' what i did
My reputation was strong, yeah for doin' what i did
All the time i was know, yeah for doin' what i did"
"John Henry was a steel drivin' boy

"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks.
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle
You'll hear"
"How could he take you in his arms and help you to be free
Then leave you forgotten and is it enough to cry?
When you're so broken
Her cold eyes tell you you're not welcome she tells lies
But you'll take her back again and is it enough to die?
When you're so taken
You will be loved again
You will be loved again
But will she sing and will she dance
And will she forever and will he sing
And will he dance and will he forever
Someday you will feel a love so deep
And you'll find someone not lost in sleep
And you will be loved again you will be loved again you will be loved again"
"Well I'm tired of livin' and I'm scared of dyin'
I can't get ahead and there's no use a tryin'
Things would better change and I ain't a lyin' somethin' better happen pretty soon
Yeah the people workin' around and everyday are gettin' promotion and raisin' pay
But I keep a workin' the same old way and somethin' better happen pretty soon
Yeah the man next door owns a forty room shack
Rides around ever day in a big Cadillac
But I'm still walkin' that's a fact seems somethin' better happen pretty soon
Well I'm tired of livin'...
[ fiddle - steel ]
Well everybody's got a girl to call his own but I keep on a livin' all alone
Like a king without a throne somethin' better happen pretty soon
Well my brother Bill he's a never broke he have worked so lick and that ain't no joke
If things don't change I'm afraid I'll croak somethin' better happen pretty soon
Yeah I'm tired of livin'..."
"When you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side when times get rough and friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
When you're down and out when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
I'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine if you need a friend I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind I will ease your mind"
"Like a hawk flying high above the city
Like a sunset cloud in a golden flame
Like a leaf on the wind moving cross the water

Watch me rise
Watch me rise above
Resting, oh resting in his love
In his love
See me as a boy safe beside my father
See my father safe when he was a boy
Time marches on, the wheel is always turning
Watch me rise
Watch me rise
Watch me rise
Watch me rise above
Resting, oh resting in his love
In his love
Watch me rise above
If you cry for me, don't do it for my sorrow
If you cry for me, do it for my joy
And let your tears fall upon the flowers
So they rise
Rise
Rise
So they rise above
Resting, oh resting in his love
Watch me rise
Watch me rise
Oh, just watch me rise
Watch me rise above
Resting, oh resting in his love
In his love
Watch me rise above"
"Gotta find out who's a callin' you when it ain't me a callin'
Gotta put a stop to your stallin' then maybe I can get some sleep
Gonna engage Dick Tracy I might retain Perry Mason
To investigate this situation then maybe I can get some sleep
(Gonna have to teach you a lesson on how to recognize love's blessin'
Till then I'll just have to keep me guessin' and you'll never ever get no sleep)
Has someone been a stealing my sugar has someone been a singing my song
Has there been a hand in the cookie jar has someone been a eatin' my honeycomb
Gonna get you down to the courthouse I'm sick and tired of bein' a man-mouse
I'll get us a licence to keep house then maybe I can get some sleep

Has someone been a stealing...

Honey wake up oh anymore all ye ever do is sleep oh well)"
"Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Do you miss me like I miss you, is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings and you think I'm on the line
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
[Chorus]
Does it thunder and lightning even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house like it's raining at mine
Is it raining at your place just like it is over here
If it is then sweetheart like me I know you're scared
I just called you to console you like any old friend would do
Is it raining at your house and by the way I still love you
[Chorus]"
"Yeah
In the circles I've been running
I've covered many miles
And I could search forever for what's right before my eyes
Just when I thought I'd found it
It was nothing like I'd planned
When I got my heart around it, it slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is
When I'm crashing through the madness
Not sure who I'm supposed to be
When I'm caught up in the darkness
It's your hand that's leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
It's a lifetime thrill
When tiding braces
The biggest things in the smallest places
In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I'm in your arms, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
In the sweetest smile, on a night like this
And a tender touch, that's where it is
When we're tangled up and can't resist
When we feel that rush, that's where it is
That's where it is"
"(Dolly Parton)
There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
"Well I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till the Lord comes and calls me calls me away oh yes
Where the morning's so bright and the lamb is the light
And the night night is as black as the sea oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness no sorrow no trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me oh yes
Oh the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by lamb oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be lead by a child
And I'll be changed changed from this creature that I am some day
There will be peace in the valley"
"Two young people, without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle with just what they need
Living on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smile
It takes more than marvel and time
Living on love
Living on love, buying on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
It's like that old fashioned storybook rhyme
Living on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinking
Love can walk through fire without blinking
It doesn't take much, when you get enough
Living on love
Two old people, without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side on that front porch swing
Living on love
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they walk through that door
Just living on love
Living on love, buying on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
It's like that old fashioned storybook rhyme
Living on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinking
Love can walk through fire without blinking
It doesn't take much, when you get enough
Living on love
Living on love, buying on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime

Living on love
No, It doesn't take much, when you get enough

"Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day and learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind
I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind
The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind"
"Well, the rain is apourin' down in a fury
And the road is lookin' long
And the only thing that comes to mind
Is the tune of this sad song
Tune of this sad song! Oh Lord!
Well, the wind is acreepin' up my back
Through the door, through the roof, through the window crack
Tossin' and a-turnin' all night long
To the rhythm and the sound of a saddened song
Saddened song! Oh Lord!
In a dream of passion I saw a face
Of a beautiful woman in a terrible place
She looked at me, and she called for you
Then she closed her eyes and she sang this tune
Sang this tune! Oh Lord!"
"I want a little sugar
In my bowl
I want a little sweetness
Down in my soul
I could stand some lovin'
Oh so bad
I feel so funny and I feel so sad
I want a little steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up
So they'll go
Whats a matter Daddy
Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl
You been acting different
I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want some steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
Whats a matter Daddy
Come on save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some, yeah, in my bowl"
"Now I'm drifting into deep water I'm starting to care for you.
You're getting me in deep water be careful what you do.
Now you want a romance but I'm seeking love I know I was ready when it ends
'cause I'm winding up in deep water why can't we just be friends
Now it's restless in this deep water I'm off between right and wrong.
And my love is true as deep water your love won't last as long.
Now where will it lead me and where will it end? I can't help but wish I only knew
'cause I'm winding up in deep water so deep in love with you."
"It was just another story written on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home
Then out on Mooresville highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
Did his girlfriend break up with him, did he buy or steal that gun?
Did he lose a fight with drugs or alcohol?
Did his Mom and Daddy forget to say I love you son?
Did no one see the writing on the wall?
I'm not blamin' anybody, we all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20, but I still don't understand...
How do you get that lonely, how do you hurt that bad
To make you make the call, that havin' no life at all
Is better than the life that you had
How do you feel so empty, you want to let it all go
How do you get that lonely... and nobody know
It was just another story printed on the second page
Underneath the Tiger's football score..."
"Sweet dreams of you, every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me, it's plain
I should know I'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you, things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new?
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about you"
"Oh my mama told me
'Cause she say she learned the hard way
Say she wanna spare the children
She say don't give or sell your soul away
'Cause all that you have is your soul
[Chorus: ]
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple
Don't you eat of the bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
'Cause all that you have is your soul
I was a pretty young girl once
I had dreams, I had high hopes
I married a man he stole my heart away
He gave his love but what a high price I paid
And all that you have is your soul
Why was I such a young fool
Thought I'd make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one can't possess another
And all that you have is your soul
[Chorus: ]
I thought, thought that I could find a way
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no debts to pay
I'd take it all, take it all I'd run away
Me for myself first class and first rate
But all that you have is your soul
Here I am waiting for a better day
A second chance
A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands
'Cause all that you have is your soul
[Chorus: ]
Oh my mama told me
'Cause she said she learned the hard way
She said she want to spare the children
She said it don't give to sell your soul away
All that you have is your soul
All that you have
All that you have
All that you have
All that you have is your soul"
"The river flows, it flows to the sea
Wherever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
All he wanted was to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
Flow river flow, past the shady trees
Go river go, go to the sea
Flow to the sea
The river flows, it flows to the sea
Wherever it goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town"
"It's only natural with time
Details can somehow slip your mind
Something so sweet, though incomplete
You fill the spaces in-between
It never will be that way again
Maybe it wasn't way back when
But to my heart and soul
This is the way the story has to be told
That's the way (that's the way) I remember it
I remember it that way
From the day I was living there
I remember it that way
Some of our stories fade as we grow older
Some get sweeter every time they're told
That's the way (that's the way) I remember you that way
Guess now if the truth were known
Among diamonds they were stones
To say would be fair, girl, nothing compares
To when I called you all my own
So darling don't ever you think twice
Those were the best days of my life
When I held you there
And I'll tell this story this way, time and again
That's the way (that's the way) I remember it
I remember it that way
From the day I was living there
I remember it that way"
"[Chorus:]
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
You're always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
How long do you think that i can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
Always late, always late
Always late, always late
How long do you think that i can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way"
"Oh it's late, I know I should be leaving
We've both got someone waiting we'll have to go
And it's so strange to think that I just met you
I almost wish I'd met you long ago
In your eyes I see a certain look
And that same look must be in mine
And who knows what we might have been
Another place, another time
I'll admit in time that I'll forget you
Cause the truth is I still love her after all
But even though we knew it couldn't happen
For a moment we felt something oh so strong
And in your eyes....."
"If I was a little --- I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd find myself a big ice stream and split it down the middle with you
That's what I'd do that's what I'd do
That's what I'd do I'd split it down the middle with you
If I was a little hummin' bird I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd get my hummin' in a perfect tune and hum a little tune for you
That's what I'd do that's what I'd do
That's what I'd do I'd hum a little tune for you
[ guitar ]
If I was a little puppy dog I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd jump right up in the middle of your lap and let my flees jump off on you
That's what I'd do that's what I'd do
That's what I'd do I'd let my flees jump off on you
That's what I'd do...
That's what I'd do..."
"Discouraged is the word these days at homes acros the range
The livestock markets down and it don't look like it's gonna change
Nobody's found a cure for what we are goin' through
But I'll tell you boys just what I'm gonna do
Well I'm gonna saddle up old paint right after shipping time
Ride out on the mountain among the aspens and the pines
Take along my fishing pole and leave my cares behind
And find myself a little piece of mind
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain live like a mountain man
Lay my body on the ground eat from a fryin' pan
I know it's not the answer but I'm gonna try to lose
These dog gone low down workin' cowboy blues
Well next year it might get better aw that's what they always say
But I've seen a string of next years come and Lord they're all the same
But as long as there's a mountain, someplace to get away
Well this old cowboy just might not go insane
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain...
These dog gone low down lonesome workin' cowboy blues"
"I slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she'll find that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang slipping around
I know there'll be the debit to pay
Cause she'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here see sweet thang I got a notion he'd be headed this way
Cause when my sweet thang's out tomocattin' around
Finds a sandbox like this to play
I want to warn all you barroom roses if my sweet thang should have a bite
You'd better take my advice if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eyes
I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little she don't know that I got
Cause there's a little cute waitress down at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
We were sittin' in the back booth just a havin' a chair
And she believed in every word that I said
When that door blew open and mama walked in yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
And she said
Well has anybody here see sweet thang..."
"Wait for the sunshine wait for the sunshine wait for the clouds to roll away
Maybe tomorrow gone will be sorrow wait for the sunshine to bring a brighter day
[ dobro ]
If sorrow and trouble you're seeing double black clouds surround you all the time
Well don't let misfortune be too discouraging remember tomorrow the sun will shine
Wait for the sunshine...
[ harmonica ]
If it seems forever since there's been laughter don't let old misery get you down
Just keep your chin up don't ever give up tomorrow the sunshine may come around
Wait for the sunshine..."
"We live in trailers and apartments too
From California to Kalamazoo
Grow up get married and when that one ends
We hate sleeping alone so we get married again
Don't wanna be buried in debt or in sin
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
We love to complain about what we can't fix
Mostly mothers in law traffic and politics
We tell our kids how hard it was back when
Same way our parents did to us back then
Thought we'd be different but we're just like them
Yeah we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
We load our kids up in our new used car
And after church we hit the mini mart
Behind the counter up there on the wall
It reads 200 million on the power ball
Six little numbers that could change it all
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto
Cause there ain't but two ways
We can change tomorrow
And there ain't no genie
And there ain't no bottle
So we pray to Jesus and we play the lotto"
"The warm wind will not blow tonight
For the the fog enshrouds
The landing light
As she said she might have heard
A bell tolling
Though a gold ship
Sails her clouds and dreams
Through the crashing seas
She finds it seems
That the shore she's looking for
Is hardly showing
Oh what is this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone,
Bringing her, her everything
Her paralytic agencies
Twist their tongues into philosophies
As petite Colombe asks only
What she's been stealing
The tapestries that drape her walls
And the heroes she has witnessed fall
While the hallway leaves them
All blank to the ceiling
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone,
Bringing her, her every dream
Beneath the deep and broken wall
The reflecting glass of time it falls
Through the crack she said
She heard the ocean calling
The foghorn cries profanity
At the master of insanity
As she watches ruins, needing me and sobbing
Oh again this song she's singing
Oh could it be for someone,
Bringing her, her everything."
"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine,
I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine,
I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine,
I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine,
I walk the line"
"Every man has to come to a crossroad somewhere along the way.
Johnny Cash came to his crossroad in a place called Nickajack Cave.
Little white pills and whiskey
Honky tonks and smoke
One night stands with his country band
Had him strung out on the ropes
Well, he cried out to Jesus
He said, ""Jesus, I think I'm too lost to save.""
He already had one foot inside the grave
As he stepped into the mouth of Nickajack Cave
Everything was darkness
Wasn't no light at all
Just the cold dank air and the pitch black dirt
And the spiders on the walls
Well, he laid down beneath a ledge
And curled up there to meet his judgment day
The shivering came upon him wave by wave
Well, he could feel the breath of death in Nickajack Cave
Then high above him shone a light
He never would forget
Then he heard a voice say, ""Johnny Cash,
I ain't through with you yet.
Get up, I ain't through with you yet.
I ain't through with you get Johnny Cash,
Get up.""
Then he crawled out from beneath that ledge
And felt a gentle breeze
Tears and dirt smeared on his face
As peaceful as could be
Well, he knelt down upon the ground
Raised his eyes up to the light and prayed
He said, ""Lord, I'll be your servant from this day.""
That's how he became ""The Man In Black"" in Nickajack Cave
That's how he became ""The Man In Black"" in Nickajack Cave
Get up Johnny Cash, I ain't through with you yet
Get up"

You wanna what?I don't think so
I don't waste my time on guys like that
You might be tough
But that's not enough to make it last

"Santa Claus comes tonight
No more days to count, but the even longer wait begins
The suspense of having to wait from bedtime to morning
Yes, kids all over the world say their prayers and go to sleep
Knowing that when they wake up, the little fat man with the long white beard
Will have stopped by their houses and left the answer to a wish
From the most magical sack there ever was
(Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho)
(Up on the house top, ho-ho-ho)
Up on the house top reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All part of a little ones with Christmas joys
(Ho-ho-ho) oh, who wouldn't go?
(Ho-ho-ho) who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click-click-click
Down to the chimney with the good St. Nick
First comes the stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa will fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that can open and shut its eyes
(Ho-ho-ho) who wouldn't go?
(Ho-ho-ho) who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click-click-click
Down through the chimney with the good St. Nick
Look in the stocking of little Bill
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Here is a little hammer and lots of tacks
A whistle and a ball and whip that cracks
(Ho-ho-ho) who wouldn't go?
(Ho-ho-ho) who wouldn't go?
Up on the housetop, click-click-click
Down through the chimney with the good St. Nick
(Ho-ho-ho) oh, who wouldn't go?

"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on.""
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh"
"He left his dead in the cottonwood trees
The ground grown too hard with the years
Falling down was not what it used to be
The ground grown too hard with the years
He told his children those little white lies
The truth would only paralyze them
He told himself those little white lies
The truth would only paralyze him
Lay it down, lay it down
He sold most of what he cherished,
The rest he let them steal
Shot his dog out in the open field,
The rest he let them steal
He broke all of his promises,
Under a sea green sky
They never thought to ask him why,
Under a sea green sky
Lay it down, lay it down
Please bury me in the cottonwood trees
The ground grown too cold for me
Going to sleep tonight in a warm feather bed
The ground grown too cold for me
Lay it down, lay it down"
"Today I'm like a leaf in autumn never again to know the spring
Today my heart is at rock bottom sorrow nothing else could bring
But those words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
You left me and what could I say for my world ended today
[ steel - guitar ]
I turned and gazed into the darkness but no tomorrow could I see
And I remember your remarkets I recall our used to be
I have a treasure yesterday something you can't take away
I'm lost I'll never find my way for my world ended today"
"Faded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you opened with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You think of what your daddy said if your money should run low
Just call I'll send your busfare to come home
But you're just to proud to take it and home won't be the same
Now you've had a taste of rodeo
You set out on the road to seek your boyhood dreams
To satisfy the hunger in your soul
You wouldn't turn back now even if you could you were born to follow rodeo
All your money's gone cept a twenty dollar bill
But that's your fees to enter old Cheyenne
And all that's in your favor is you and your try
And a deep knawing desperately to win
Ss you step out on the highway with your thumb up in the air
In your mind a promise has been made
If this way of life don't kill you or you don't starve to death
You swear you'll be the champion someday
You set out on the road...
Faded old blue wranglers dusty cowboy hat pair of scuffed up boots upon your feet
Can of pork n beans that you open with your knife
It ain't much but its all you've got to eat
You set out on the road..."
"(When they ring those golden bells for you and me)
There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by fate's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals then to dwell with thing immortals
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing don't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

When our days shall know the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
Never more with anguish laidin' we shall reach that lovely aimin'
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing..."
"Just because we're scared
Doesn't mean we're wrong
The world won't end today
If both of us move on
But didn't we have a time?
You can't take that away
We've had a change of mind
I think it's safe to say
That I've been holding on to you
And you've been holding on to me
'Cause neither of us wants to be
The first to say goodbye
And so it goes, we must admit
How we both thought that this was it
Though we couldn't make the pieces fit
You can't say we didn't try
Close the window, pull the shade
Turn the key and lock the door
We'd best forget the plans we made
We don't live here anymore
Maybe somewhere down the line
We'll remember who we were
Another place, another time
Some old feeling starts to stir
But I've been holding on to you
And you've been holding on to me
'Cause neither of us wants to be
The one to say goodbye
And so it goes we've grown apart
Guess you could say we lost a heart
And even though we came up short
You can't say we didn't try"
"I called him for days, he didn't answer the phone
I drove by his house, I knew he was home
A week's worth of papers and mail in the box
I thought he was dead, I picked the lock
I found him in tears in the dark on his knees
With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be
And he said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Call for the lady with the alligator purse
She knows the spell to lift this curse
Go find the lady with the alligator purse
In an old stone house off 21st
I found the lady with the alligator purse
She answered the door, said I know who you are
She lit a candle, consulted the stars
When I saw her closing that reptile's hide
I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die
And she said
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse
I'm just the lady with the alligator purse
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
So said the lady with the alligator purse
She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra
When she didn't take my advice
And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it
Too bad, those kids were so nice
By the time we got back to my pitiful pal
There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator
Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes
She opened the bag, there was nothing inside
She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use
I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes
And she said
Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse
Don't call the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
Love is the magic of the universe
Take it from the lady with the alligator purse
The lady with the alligator purse"
"In the bicentennial summer of our faded glory land a bright new face appeared upon the scene. Of an honest peanut farmer by the name of Jimmy Carter. His eyes were set on every school boys dream.
Chorus: Well the odds were stacked against him but he was not afraid to fight, the mighty facist empire lined up on the right. So shake the hand of the man, with a handful of love, the one and only Jimmy Carter.
There was joy throughout the nation, at that great inauguration, the GOP stood shakin in their shoes. Serenaded by Willie, and toasted by Billy, this president with honest peanut roots.
Chorus: Well he said I'd never lie to you, and what's more he never did. Though the times grew mighty tough, he never flipped his lid. So shake the hand of the man, with a hand full of love. The one and only Jimmy Carter."

"It's been through hell and back
Been broke showin' cracks
But it's yours, my heart is yours
It's been a while since it had to feel
Love shy and newly healed
But it's yours, my heart is yours

Let's take it easy, it's easy to see girl
It still ain't that strong
It's barely beaten from being so beaten
For so long
It's been through hell and back
Been broken, showin' cracks
But it's yours, my heart is yours

There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul
My God is real, He's real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and He made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel him in my soul
I cannot tell just how it felt
When Jesus washed my sins away
But since that day, yes, since that hour
God has been real for I can feel his mighty power
My God is real, He's real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and He made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel him in my soul"
"There's a place out west where the Powder River runs off the Big Horn Mountains
And winds it's way out across the plains
It's a land of red walls blue sky and clean air
Where the eagle glides high above the canyons
And makes his nest in the rocks that overlook the valleys
Where the sagebrush and the cottonwoods grow
This is ranch country has been for more than one hundred years
Well things have changed some since the early days
But there's still a thread of character and tradition
That runs thru from one generation to the next
You can see it out here the way folks sit a horse
You can hear it in the way they talk
And when the work is all done there's nothing they like better
Than to get together at the one-room schoolhouse under the red wall
For another down homegrown western Saturday night
Well the calving's all done and the brandins' through
Hayin' don't start for a week or two
There ain't but one thing left to do it's time to celebrate
One two three four
Headin' west out of town on a blacktop road folks are comin' by the pickup load
For a western good time alamode better bring along your appetite
Take a right hand turn through the cattle guard
Park it down in the old school yard
Gonna kick up my boots with my cowboy pards and hold my woman tight
Yippee yi-ay and a hey diddle diddle Ord's on the guitar Ross on the fiddle
Pull down your hat keep your mind in the middle raise a ruckus tonight
From the butterfly to the jitterbug me and my lady's gonna cut a rug
Wild Bill's crackin' out that old square mug
On another down home good time homegrown western Saturday night
Well the little kids are playin' tag out back
Someone's peekin' through the outhouse crack
And if his mom could see him she'd have a heart attack
And he'd have a hard time sittin' down
Now, the young cowboys are starting to sweat
The teenage girls are playin' hard to get
And it's driving them crazy but the night's young yet
Give um time they'll come around
Yippee yi-ay and a hey diddle diddle Ord's on the guitar Ross on the fiddle
We come here to party and not spit and whittle while the moon is shining bright
There's a coyote howlin' from the hills above to the harmony of a morning dove
For the couple in the moonlight fallin' in love
On another down home good time homegrown western Saturday night
Now the midnight supper really hit the spot there's beef and pie and coffee in a pot
And if you drank to much I'll tell you what it'll sure get you back on your feet
Well the old couple sitting by the schoolhouse door
Grinin' at the kids dancin' around the floor
And they remember the way it was years ago how the memories taste so sweet
Yippee yi-ay and a hey diddle diddle Ord's on the guitar turn it up a little
We come here to party and not spit and whittle from Faded Love to the Cattle Call
The music flows out to the old red wall it'll echo around till clear next fall
Well have another down home good time homegrown western Saturday night"
"Spanish is a loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spray
Was a girl he learned it from
Living down Sonora way
He don't look much like a lover
But he says her love words over
Mostly when he's all alone
Mi amor mi corazon
On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers
How those hours would get to flying
All too soon he'd hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone
Mi amor mi corazon
He ain't seen her since that night
He can't cross the line you know
They want him for a gamblin' fight
Like as not it's better so
Yet he's always sort of missed her
Since that last sad night he kissed her
Lost his heart, left her own
Adios mi corazon
Lost his heart, left her own
Adios mi corazon"
"If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you"
"Well I was born with a dark cloud above me
A longing deep in my soul
I was raised up right and I know my momma loved me
But I begged her to let me go
I said, ""The grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'till I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride""
You know, I love you, my true companion
You've been my lifelong friend
But there's a hunger inside me
That I can't abandon 'till I see what's around the bend
You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'till I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride
Now I've been a rogue and I've been a rambler
I know too well my sins
I've got the faith of a saint but the soul of a gambler
And a heart like the restless wind
You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'till I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride
Yeah, if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride"
"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A."
"Blue eyes cuttin' through the summer day
Every ray of light seems to come from her face
From the tip of her toes to the top of her head
She's a hundred percent a American Girl
She's my sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine
My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me
Just watch her shine and she's mine, mine, mine
She's my sweet sun angel
She's my umbrella in the pourin' rain
She's my shelter in this wild, wild hurricane
Gotta Heaven full of stars shinin' in her eyes
And I swear I haven't felt so good in my whole life
She's my sweet sun angel
Every bit of summer time
Never seen her look so fine
My sweet sun angel
If you ever see her on the street
You'll know just what she does to me

"Well I went down to a Music City function
Where I just heard a song that I had to howl out
My lawyers told my to proceed with caution
Or I'd make a whole lot of songwriters mad
Uh-huh
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I take a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with old Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP, SESAC, or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye
I had my number two pencil going about a mile a minute
Till I had his ideas all written down
And I knew I really went and did it
When the police came and hauled my butt downtown
And I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw's
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
Well I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE that song and I must confess
When I went to court I plead no contest
Got a big fat lip and two black eyes
Never should have messed with his copyright
Yeah
I told the judge I had writers block but he hauled my butt away
And now it hurts too much to laugh about the song I stole that day
When I said
Hey John Michael Montgomery won't mind
If I steal a song and make it mine all mine
Like I did so many times with Tim McGraw
Yeah I never heard anything sound so fine
Mind if I borrow one or two of your lines
So I stole it once stole it twice
I STOLE it from a writer on Music Row
Well he just moved to town and he didn't know
About ASCAP, SESAC, or BMI
So he might as well kiss his song goodbye

STOLE

"Now,
Don't just walk away
Pretending everything's okay and you don't care about me
And I
Know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now ooh, ooh, ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Are you happy now?
You, took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate and you don't care about it
Yeah
And I
Am giving up this game
And leaving you with all the blame 'cause I don't care
Yeah yeah yeah
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now? Ooh, ooh, ooh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased are you happy now? ooh, ooh, ooh
Are you happy now?

Or have I been erased are you happy now? Yea-yea, yeah

"(To be alone) to be alone (with just a memory) with just a memory
This is my destiny to be alone
(You left me here) you left me here
(With just these walls to see) with just these walls to see
I know you meant for me to be alone
You left me to be alone but there's one thing that you didn't count on
Something far beyond your imagination
I knelt and I prayed and I recieved a much much deeper consolation
And now I share a greater love you see it's not so bad for me to be alone
With my head bowed down on my knees I prayed and I cried
And He dried my tears and He promised me that He'd forever be at my side
He'll be my friend beyond eternity it dasn't worry me to be alone"
"Stand beside me stand beside me you're the only one who ever made me care
I can't stand to think that I might be alone
Not alone again not the way it was back then
Before you walked into my heart and told me we'd never part
So stand beside be don't ever let me be alone again
Stand beside me stand beside me for if I should lose you I just couldn't get anywhere
Stand beside me stand beside me you're the only one who ever made me care
Now the sands of time may turn our hair to silver
But growing old is fun if your young heart's true to one
You know it's true to you like it can't be with me and you
So stand beside me I'll be standing right there yes right there next to you
Stand beside me"
"The reason why I can't say
Gotta let you go babe and right away
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Baby for a long time you had me believe
You said your love was all mine and that's the way it would be
I didn't know that you were putting me on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
I got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your game anymore
After what you did I can't stay on
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone
Oh when you're gone*"
"Window seat
30,000 feet
Above the ground
Blue moon beams on silver wings
Brings me down
Slipping off my coat for the long night flight
I finda note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words
As I close my eyes:
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are
These days I leave
The one who needs me
More and more it seems
It's a high price that she pays
For the dreams I dream
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight
Where ever you are
God hold you in his arms
While we're apart
Though you're far away
Your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight, sweetheart, sleep tight
Where ever you are"
"Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm a fool for staying home and having none.
I can't get over how she set me free.
Oh, lonesome me.
There must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about my past and find someone new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me.
I'll bet she's not like me.
She's out and fancy free,
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so,
And brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms"
"I just came by to let you know
I'll never ever let you go, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
And if you ever, ever stray
I know that that will be the day
That I die, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
Ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my love
I've been around the world a bit
But you're the best thing I've seen yet, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
And if you want to take me on
We might be at it until dawn, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
Ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my love
Hey baby
You see where I've been and you know where I'm going
Oh come on boy
My heart's on my sleeve and my love is showing
And if you stay around
I'm never ever gonna let you down, oh my, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
Ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my love"
"I'm going out of my mind these days
Like I'm walking ?round in a haze
Can't think straight, can't concentrate
I need a shave
I go to work and I look tired
The boss says son you're gonna get fired
This ain't your style
And behind my coffee cup
I just smile
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
This morning I put salt in my coffee
I put my shoes on the wrong feet
Losing my mind I swear
You might be the death of me
But I don't care
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Is it your eyes, is it your smile
All I know is that you're driving me wild
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in
Spending all my time with you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
What a sweet addiction that I'm caught up in
I can't get enough
Or stop this hunger for your love
What a beautiful mess, what a beautiful mess I'm in"
"Lonesome Road Blues
I walked on down that lonesome line
Hung my head and I cried
I wept and I cried under a willow tree
Out by the deep blue sea
My mama, my dear papa can be found,
And my brother on a county road
Now I been down that long plank walk,
I?m on my way back home
You cause me to weep, you do cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
I cried last night and the night before
I swear I won?t cry anymore
Your fast mail train comin round that track
Killed my brown eyed boy
They took him down that smokey track
Brought him back on a cooling board
Now I?m lookin down that lonesome line
Just as far as I care to see
I have no money lost my brown eyed boy
These blues won?t set me free"
"When I get up in the mornin'
And I face a brand new day
I know that you're beside me
Every Step of the way.
For so long now we've been lovers
Always been the best of friends
I raise my glass up to ya!
As we start all over again.
I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
[Instrumental]
I gave my heart away to you
The first time I felt the touch of your hand
And twenty-five years later
I still wanna be your man.
And I'll love you till the day that I die
With a feeling that will never grow old
I'll keep my arm around you
When you start to move a little slow.
And our love will never fade away
Our story will forever be told
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold.
You know where you can find me
When silver turns to gold..."
"On the wrong end of the highway
When the long night has no end
When there's no one there beside me
'Til I hold you once again
[Chorus]
Thank God for the radio
When I'm on the road
When I'm far from home
And feelin' blue
Thank God for the radio
Playin' all night long
Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you
There's a song that we first danced to
And there's a song they played the night we met
And there's a song we first made love to
That's a song I'll never forget
[Chorus]
Playin' all the songs
Than mean so much to me and you
Thank God for the radio"
"I thought I'd be an angel
And fly on astral skies
I thought I'd wear a fanciful disguise
And It's taken me a lotta time
To find out I'm not one
An outlaw on the run,
On this side of the sun.
I hoped I'd be a champion
And live without a care
I thought I'd change the world,
Make it just and fair
But my youth slipped by before my eyes
Much to my surprise
Before I had begun,
On this side of the sun.
Out on this end of the wind
Winter's coming 'round the bend
You pray for rain, before you know,
You're standin' in a foot of snow
So you pull your coat up to your chin
Pick your shovel up again
'Cause your work is never done,
On this side of the sun.
[Instrumental]
I took it to a fortune teller
I thought that she might help me
She looked into my eyes
And smiled mysteriously
But she didn't know as much as me
I stared back, dejectedly
'Cause I know where she's from,
This side of the sun.
Out behind these prison walls,
Dark clouds come and hard rains fall
You pause a moment for a dream,
They row you gently down the stream
You wake up angry in the night,
Jump up, ready for the fight
But the war is never won
On this side of the sun.
Now they tell me music
Can free a person's soul
So I sing a song everywhere I go
But It's not much different than before
I'm still looking for the door
I wonder if there is one,
On this side of the sun..."
"Writer Dolly Parton
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true"
"Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
To dream about you though you left me I wonder where you are tonight
That old rain is cold and slowly falling upon my window pane tonight
And though your heart was even colder I wonder where you are tonight
Then came the dawn the day you left me I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me that lingers in my heart tonight
That old rain is cold and slowly falling"
"TO YOU AND YOURS (FROM ME AND MINE)
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY GEORGE HAMILTON 1V
Wedding bells are ringing on two sides of town tonight
One wedding it's at seven one's at nine
A pair of old sweethearts will hold their new sweethearts so tight
Best of luck to you and yours from me and mine
To you and yours may happiness flow free
May you find in him the faith you lost in me
And although I don't love her yet perhaps I will in time
Best of luck to you and yours from me and mine
I'm afraid to say I do for fear I really done
Afraid my conscience might not walk the line
For even though I'll kiss her lips it's your lips that I want
That's a difference in you and yours and me and mine
To you and yours..."
"Well, it looks like he's doin' what I didn't do
Givin' you love and money too, it's over
Where do I go from here
Well, I appreciate the nice goodbye
Not even a letter so that I
Could fool myself into thinkin' that you really cared
I tried to give you everything you wanted
But it looks like I got buried by the flame I started
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had
Now there's nobody left for me to blame
If I could do it over I'd do it the same
I gave you my very best
You said you'd love me through thick and thin
But when one heart lies the other can't win for losin'
Where do I go from here
Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had"

"Down to a dollar in a terrible fix, i was hopin my bookie would call
Coolin my heels at the motel six, waitin for the axe to fall
Phone rings, man, i'm white as a ghost
But it's my baby on the line from the jersey coast, she says
""C'mon home, honey,"" gonna make it after all, and it's
First stop, salt lake city
Big springs, laramie lookin mighty pretty
Ogallala, north platte, sun settin in it
Newton to chicago in a new york minute
Then it's hobart, elkhart, maumee, cuyanoga
Youngstown, hazletown, dover i'm a flyin over
Fairfax, bloomfield, bless a my soul:
Highway 80, she's a might good road
I saw me a yarn on the tv set about the surfers out in malibalou
So i bought me some baggies and i hopped me a jet just to see if them stories was true
Well the water was cold and the beer was hot
Called my baby from the parkin lot, i said
""Baby, do you miss me?"" ""honey, you know that i do""
And it's first stop, salt lake city...
Now if i was a actor or a high-rollin hippie i would head out for the califo-line
Cruise my caddie up and down the strip, hollywood and by-god vine
But i'm an oklahoma boy and i'm east coast bound
Got a redneck woman in a blueblood town
And i'm goin back to see my baby just one more time
And it's first stop, salt lake city..."
"Mother dear come bathe my forehead
For I'm growing very weak
Mother let one drop of water
Fall upon my burning cheek
I'm going away to leave you mother darling
And remember what I say
Do this won't you please dear mother
Put my little shoes away
Santa Claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
I believe he brought an angel
With a pair of golden wings
Tell my loving little playmates
That I never more will play
Give them all my toys but mother
Put my little shoes away"
"Once again he's left you here crying
It hurts me to see him hurt you this way
Once again here I am trying
To make the tears disappear from your face
For your sake
Let me take that heartache off your hands
You've stood more than one heart can stand
Don't give up on love 'til you give me a chance
Let me take that heartache off your hands
These shoulders were made for you to cry on
If you need them they're yours any time
These arms are yours to try on
I'll make sure they fit you just right
They'll hold you tight
Let me take that heartache off your hands
You've stood more than one heart can stand
Don't give up on love 'til you give me a chance
Let me take that heartache off your hands"
"Baby can't you feel that
Baby don't you hear that
That's the sound freedom calling our name
It's telling us that all we gotta do is turn the key
Let this feeling carry us away
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets ride
Girl you know the night is young
No reason not to run
A few miles of memories down this road
Baby we don't need a map
Pick a star we'll follow that
What are we waitin on girl lets go
Baby lets ride
Chase a little sunset
Watch that full moon rise
Baby lets ride
Find some road where there ain't no end in sight
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets ride
This is how you got me feelin right now
Baby lets ride
Don't look back it'll never come down
Let the wheels of this RAM truck kick up a little dust while your holding on tight
Come on!
Baby lets ride"
"Get your favorite photo and send it to me
Along with a curle from your hair
Write on the package so the postman will know
To treat it with tender lovin' care
Wrap up a dream or two and send them along
Send anything that you can send
If it's old or if it's new sweetheart I promise you
I'll treat it with tender lovin' care
For now my dream has ended and you found someone new
But though my dream has ended I'm still in love with you
Send along a memory of the happiness we shared
And when it comes I'll treat it with tender lovin' care
[ steel ]
For now my dream has ended..."
"The flies have quit their buzzing
Even Bear has stopped his barking
They all sense something brewing
Up the James and headed this way
Bobby sips his morning coffee
Says 'Have you finished with the funnies?
Looks like a storm's coming honey
Guess we'll have to stay in bed today'
I've heard that into every life
A little of it must fall
If there's any truth to the saying,
Lord, let it be a southern rain
Marie was born in Macon, Georgia
She met a west coast lawyer
He plucked that sweet magnolia
And carried her to the hills of West L.A.
She says 'I never thought I'd tire of a dollar
But this life has grown so hollow
Every night there's lipstick on his collar
And every morning I wash it away'
She heard that into every life
A little of it must fall
So she spends her evenings praying
For a little of that southern rain
Cars alive on city streets
Of sparkling black water
Like waves beneath my window
Never break just roll away
Tonight, this rain will be my lullaby
These cars, my dreams
To carry me home to stay
The wipers beat a rhythm
Truck spray obscures my vision
But I'm closing in on my destination
Two more hours and I'll be at your door
And it will never cease to amaze me
How a little rain can drive folks crazy
When I'd trade all my blue skies gladly
For your blue eyes, crooked smile
And a steady downpour
I've heard that into every life
A little of it must fall,
But you'll never catch me complaining
About too much of that southern rain"
"(David McDade)
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"(Dolly Parton)
Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
Sunny skies and a rosy bed
Thorns and storm clouds up ahead
'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark
For those of us with a jealous heart
Imagination runnin' wild
Like a frantic frightened child
Any time that we're apart
I can't control my jealous heart
And you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
I love you more than words can tell
One day's heaven two days hell
Suspicious words like poison darts
Spoken from my jealous heart
Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things, imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart"
"Oh it seems the sun will never shine
The skies are so gray and the heart you left broken is lonely
The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing
I long for the days you loved me only
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new
Young hearts so tender in their yearning
But seasons, change and lovers too
And winter's twice as cold
But the fire in one heart is always burning
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain
And what was love is just a spell that's broken
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lover's do
Seems our hearts have never really spoken
Sorrow lingers, shadows only fill the empty room
Nights of lonely cries unheard
In the winter of a broken heart"
"You told me all i would need was a little time
But getting over you is still such an uphill climb
I know i ought to be living in the present tense
But the past i had with you was the last time
My life made sense
[Chorus:]
Call me crazy-for hurting this way
Call me crazy-go on and say
It's a phase i'm going through
Call me crazy-crazy over you
I know you don't really mean to be so unkind
But pardon me if i'm not in the right frame of mind
To go on hearing how i should start all over again
Face the future without you-
I wouldn't know how to begin
(repeat chorus)
Bridge:
You say I'm lost in a fantasy
But what we had was real to me
Call me crazy"
"Even the loser likes to dream
Sometimes my lips pretend that they're touching yours again
Then with open arms I whisper your name
Then my misty eyes grow dim for I know that you're with him
But even the loser likes to dream
Even the loser still dreams of his old sunshine I close the curtains every time it rains
I know that it's no use I should turn your mem'ry loose
But even the loser likes to dream
[ steel ]
Even the loser...
Yes even the loser likes to dream"
"This ain't no long journey home.
This ain't no trip across the tracks.
This ain't no dead end street
There ain't no turning back.
This ain't no long journey home.
Another tale about an aging man,
A tried but twisted plot,
Another hero finding out that he's not.
Act one we watch the onion peel.
Act two the tragic flaw revealed.
In three we close our eyes as his fate's sealed.
This ain't no long journey home.
Here's a story about a once young girl
Whose life has turned to rot.
Thought she found her dreams but she had not.
Act one we see her bold and strong.
Act two we watch her fumble along.
In three we close our eyes as all goes wrong.
This ain't no long journey home.
This ain't no trip across the tracks.
This ain't no dead end street
There ain't no turning back.
This ain't no long journey home.
A cautionary tale for all who come this way,
A warning writ in water.
Act one you'll see it all so clear.
Act two you'll watch it disappear.
In three open your eyes and stare down your fears.
Cause this ain't no long journey home.
This ain't no long journey home.
This ain't no long journey home.
This ain't no long journey home."
"Have you failed in your plan of your storm caused life
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
Are you weary and worn from its tort and strife
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
He will keep to the end ease your dearest friend
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand

Are you walking alone through the shadows dim
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
Pride will comfort your heart put your trust in him
Place your hand in the nail scarred hand
Place your hand..."
"I'm in a Texas state of mind
Been lonely too long this time
California's too damn far from you and that old long star
I'm in a Texas state of mind
You're dreams are much more than mine
And each one leaves my farther behind
I need to hold you again so come home
While you're in a Texas state of mind
Just as soon as I see the lights of big D
I know honey you'll have me smiling again
Don't forget that you're mine down at Sunset and Vine
Keep me in mind when you see those LA women"

"Is the better part over?
Has a ragin' river turned into a stream?
Is the better part over?
Are we down to not quite sayin' what we mean?
And after thinkin' it over
Wouldn't you rather have the endin' nice and clean
Where love remains in all the closing scenes?
If the better part's over
Why hang around
For an endin' that's laden with sorrow?
We've both been around
We've both seen that movie before
And as much as I love you
I can't live while fearin' tomorrow
If the better part's over
Then why should we try anymore?
Is the better part over?
Has a ragin' river turned into a stream?
Is the better part over?
Are we down to not quite sayin' what we mean?
And after thinkin' it over
Wouldn't you rather have the endin' nice and clean
Where love remains in all the closing scenes
Is the better part over?"
"The house was like a tomb.
I was hiding in my room.
As my brother made his way on down the hall.
I didn't want to say goodbye.
And I was trying to deny there was a war,
And that he got the call.
I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive.
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried
You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.
I'll do anything you want,
Clean your room, or wash your car.
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.
But he said, this is what brothers are for.
Well I have my heroes,
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.
And I wrote him every night,
I said I miss our pillow fights,
But lately I just wonder where you're at.
Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.
I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near.
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove
I'll do anything you want.
There must be someone I can call,
And just maybe they would let you come back home.
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.
I may never have to face the anger of those guns,
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much.
Well, it had been two years,
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.
And as I ran and held him tight,
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for."
"Now that old car, ain't gonna last
You ride all day and I'll buy the gas
The more I work, the more you spend
Tell me, honey baby, when will this all end?
Her bags are packed, my nerves are racked
She got a one way ticket, ain't comin' back
Oh baby, baby
Where you gonna find a good man like me?
Take a look at this house, turned upside down
I hung the clothes on the line
They blowed down to the ground
Tryin' to eat my own cookin' but it's awful bland
I'm tellin' you right now things are out of hand
Her bags are packed, my nerves are racked
She got a one way ticket, ain't comin' back
Oh baby, baby
Where you gonna find a good man like me?"
"He got a wrinkled up rock 'n' roll T-shirt on and a beanbag for a couch
He can hold his beer but he can't hold a job and he creeps your little sister out
When he flexes his muscle and he makes that Hooters girl on his right arm dance
Well he wants to be a star play air guitar someday in a heavy metal band
[chorus] That's a red flag, that's a bad sign,
That's a good fit somethin' ain't right
Hold on there, I wouldn't go there
If I was you
I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When he said, ""Hey baby can I bum a couple bucks for gas,""
Yeah that's a red flag.
You say this one's different cause he bought you flowers, a dozen fr'every day of the week
He drives by your house every hour on the hour and writes you poetry
It's all about destiny, how it's meant to be, how it's written in the stars that shine
And he's talkin' love and kids and stuff, and you've only been out one time
[Repeat chorus w/new ending]
Now I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When he called just to say ""I called how come you didn't call me back?""
Yeah that's a red flag.

Mama's boy and jocks and flirts, weirdos in speedos and plain old jerks
And hare-brained half-baked honky tonk clowns with half a dozen girls in half a dozen towns

Now I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When some guys says ""My ex-old lady was a nag,""
Yeah that's a red flag."
"Help me Merle, I'm breakin' out in a Nashville rash
It's a-looking like I'm fallin' in the cracks
I'm too country now for country, just like Johnny Cash
Help me Merle, I'm breakin' out in a Nashville rash
Shoulda' known it when they closed the Opry down
Things are bound to change in that town
You can't grow when you rip the roots out of the ground
Looks like that Nashville rash is getting' 'round
[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how things can really change
Rock and roll back in the 70's are country hits today
Breaks my heart to see my heroes fadin' away
The victims of Nashville rash, it's Nashville's ways
[Chorus: x2]
Help me Merle, I'm breakin' out in a Nashville rash
It's a-looking like I'm fallin' in the cracks
I'm too country now for country, just like Johnny Cash
And Buck Ownes and Faron Young and Johnny Bush
Ad Johnny Paycheck and Charley Pride and Loretta Lynn, mmm
Help me Merle, I'm breakin' out in a Nashville rash
Aw good god it's gonna be the death of us"
"While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I'm special
Cover me with sweetness
'Cause the time will come when we're not so young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Livin' free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin' in our bare feet
'Cause when the summer's done
We might not be so young and beautiful
It's a crazy ride
And, baby, you and I
Are keepin' our sweet love alive, tonight
While we're young and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
We'll party down on main street
Wearing next to nothin'
Feelin' every heartbeat
Having fun
While we're still young and beautiful
It's a crazy ride
And, baby, you and I
Are keepin' our sweet love alive, tonight
While we're young and beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, young and beautiful, oh
Beautiful, beautiful, young and beautiful, oh
It's a crazy ride
And, baby, you and I
Are keepin' our sweet love alive, tonight
While we're young and beautiful
Oh, so beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Cover me with sweetness
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you do
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, so beautiful"
"Well I just got over one case of the blues now I've got another one that I can't lose
The pain of bein' lonely cuts like a knife looks like I'm gonna have the blues for life
Yeah the sun comes up and the sun goes down
The mean old blues will keep on comin' around
Looks like they're movin' right in to stay I'm gonna be with 'em till my dyin' day
Well I'm up in the creek and I got no orr blues keep comin' round more and more
Don't know how it feels but it's been nice not to have to worry bout the blues for life
Well the guy next door really got it made stays every day layin' in the shade
Got no troubles nor brief nor strife never has to worry bout the blues for life
Yeah the sun comes up."
"I'll tell you something you don't know
Something I found out long ago
Something that's bothered you
It's alright babe it bothered me too
Sometimes we catch on kinda slow
I think that you would know its true
and maybe you'd not think so of you
and sometimes we must be told
sometimes before we get too old
and that's all that I'm tryin' to do
I know that how loneliness can burn
but that's only one thing you must learn
I know you're feelin' down
but there are things lower than the ground
now you've got one more place to turn
So I'll tell you something you don't know
Something I found out long ago
Something that's bothered you
It's alright babe it bothered me too
Sometimes we catch on kinda slow"
"I love you so much that I can't leave you even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think that you still love me
And all my thoughts of leaving do no good
You've got me heart over mind worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
Friends tell me they see you with another and in my heart I try hard to forget
But you come home and tell me you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet
You've got me heart over mind
No my heart won't let my love for you change"
"[Verse one]
I'm looking for Christmas, I've gotta find
Christmas, flying back in my mind
Does anyone know of this Christmas, a long ago christmas
Sleigh bells ringing, carolers singing
Only bringing the long traveled message of love
[Verse two]
I'm looking for Christmas, in time for this
Christmas, a day far and away
And could a star show me Christmas,
The town of old Christmas
Where truth is ringing, a virgin's
Bringing the newborn king and the
Lord's own messiah of love
[Chorus one]
And I close my eyes and I'm kneeling there in the stall,
And could I be the wine man, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom for all
Verse three
I'm looking for Christmas, I know I'll find Christmas
Imparted right from the start
And everyone knows of this Christmas
The very first Christmas
Where Christ is guiding, all with tidings
Still his light is residing here in us all
[Chorus two]
And I close my eyes, and a thousand lifetimes recall
Aren't we all wise magi, sharing his wisdom,
Creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each Christmas day
We are sharing his wisdom creating a kingdom
As born on this Christmas and each
Christmas day that shall fall"
"All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear, water
Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for me and you
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Water, water, water
Keep a movin', Dan, don't cha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
He spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for me and you"

I might have looked the other way

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling

And kept out of sight
Other girls were never quite

"All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you
I climbed across the mountain tops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules
But, baby, I broke them all for you
Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you
For you
You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess
No, they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what
I've been through like you do
And I was made for you
And all of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am
But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true, I was made for you
It's true that I was made for you"
"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone"
"Blue skies, smiling at me
Nothing but blues skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long

When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on"
"if only i had paid attention
to what you needed from me
i would have seen what you were missing
in the man i promised you i'd be
and if only i had listened
to what your heart was trying to say
then i wouldn't be here wishing
for the love that i let slip away
chorus 1
and everyday that goes by no matter how hard i try
i can't change the past and i can't bring you back
and all the things i didn't do and the pain i put you thru
i crossed that line and it was more than love allowed
if only i'd known then what i know now
if only i could make a happy ending
wave a magic wand and touch your heart
but what's the use in me pretending
when i don't even know where you are
chorus 2
and everyday that goes by no matter how hard i try
i can't change the past, no i can't bring you back

"I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lyin' cold the way you left them
But at least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me
It's been a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talkin'
There's so little left to say, we haven't said
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowin'
Funny, I don't even care
When you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses"
"Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all"

But don't let them see you cry
You just got to keep on keeping on

Don't you know you're gonna be a star

Don't you know you're gonna be a star, yeah"
"He's just leadin' you on honey he'll be gone
Before the ring on your finger turns green
Your new love is the playboy kind he's not looking for the ties that bind
He'll leave you with a tortured mind before the ring on your finger turns green
He's just leadin' you...
He's fickle cheap and phoney too just like the ring he gave to you
I know cause I've been through it too when the ring on my finger turned green
He's just leadin' you...
Before the ring on your finger turns green"

Chorus:
I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd have a never ending love for you
After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Feel for each other
From now on
Feel so good I can hardly stand it
Repeat Chorus"
"I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet
But Gabriel don came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try,
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took that tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you
I sent my love across the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave
At this point it was you and me
And mama didn't raise no slave
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell"
"Last night I got busted
For acting just like myself
While wishing I was somebody else
And everybody knows just who I am
I'm the chewing gum stuck in your hair
And what's making you smile
Is making me sad...
I know it feels good but this is gonna be bad
And all of my blessings just make you mad
What's making you smile
Is making me sad...
When you said ""Goodbye""
I heard ""Hello""
Where are you gonna go?
I'm the only fool you know...
We found a place between love and hate
Where nothing feels that good
And nothing feels that great
And what's making you smile
Is making me sad...
I know it feels good but this is gonna be bad
And all of my blessings just make you mad
What's making you smile
Is making me sad..."
"Dreams, I have dreams when I'm awake when I'm asleep
And you, you are in my Dreams
You're underneath my skin, how am I so weak
And now in my dreams,
I can feel the weight, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
How long, can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?
Keep, can you keep it in?
Keep it behind lashes, can you make it last?
And now in my dreams, I can feel the weight
I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
Oh, I have dreams, I have dreams
(And then an amazing guitar solo)
Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone, am I showin' signs?
And now, in my dreams
I can feel the weight, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
I have dreams, I have, I have, I have Dreams"
"When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
In his eyes there's no one else to make his dreams come true
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
She alone can give the strength he needs to carry through woman I love you
You are my inspiration you're my way to happiness
Things that you do for me show the love that you possess
When a man loves a woman the way that I love you
In his eyes there's no one else to make his dreams come true woman I love you
You are my inspiration"
"Goodbye good luck God bless you may you find what you're searching for
May your guardian angel walk with you as you walk away from my door
Oh I made my first big mistake dear when I tried to be someone that I can't
And I can't live a life any longer no I just can't be something that I ain't
Goodbye good luck...
[ steel - guitar ]
Oh you tried so hard to make me over and do something that you were searching for
And there's no use to go on pretending I could never live up to the part
Goodbye good luck..."
"How do I
Break it to my heart
That it's gotta get over you
How do I
Learn to live apart
From the one I gave my life to
Well right here
Right now
Better turn me inside out
So I can just move on
Bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore
How will I
Learn to trust again
If I can't forgive
How will I
Let a new love in
If I'm still holding on to
all these angry tears
And those wasted years
The only way I'll ever let them go
So bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore
So bring on the pain
Let it kill your memory
Bring on the rain
Let it drown what's left of you and me
I know the only way I'm ever gonna make it
Is burying the best of us though it's killing me
'Cause I don't love you any less
No I don't love you any less
But I can't love you anymore"
"I was just a lonely boy stickin' close to home
Content to be there with my folks without a thought to roam
But late one night a change of my mind turned to left down low
This was the time I had to find where that gravel road did go
I got into a city about the break of day
All worn out from a long long walk I stopped at a small cafe
They served me coffee black and strong they were servin' liquor too
And I saw this girl with honey hair and eyes of visual blue
My heart jumped right into my throat I thought that it would fail
Too green to see the invisible sign wild honey keep for sale
I walked right in sat right down and soon my plans were made
A lonely boy too starved for love too dumb to be afraid
Her every wish was my command it only took a smile
And I spent my hard earned money like it was goin' out of style
Now there's no money in my jeans and you find to to be her man
I have to the things she ask with the pocketful in my hand
I'll take my heart back to the farm with mem'ries quite a few
Where the angry buzz and the sting of the bee is only harm wild honey can do
Where the angry buzz and the sting of the bee is only harm wild honey can do"
"Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand
A read will hang upon your door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on
Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever with this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it I promised to death do us part
Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay
Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries that we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember the dsay we said till death do us part"
"Annabel, Annabel, where did you go?
I've looked high and Ive looked low
I've looked low and Ive looked high
Tell me where does the spirit go when you die?
Oh where does the spirit go when you die?
I have packed your satin gloves and lace
All the pictures of your pretty face
And I kept the ones of you on skates
And a picture from your wedding day
Annabel Annabel way up high
Are you kissing the starry birds in the sky?
Will you come and visit us down below?
Oh Annabel Annabel where did you go
Annabel where did you go?
You will miss the humming of the spring
And the winter wont mean anything
And the summer is a lonesome dale
I am lost without you Annabel
I have lost my faith in everything
Annabel Annabel are you free?
Will you wrap me in your legacy?
In a blanket with your sweet perfume
I am always thinking thoughts of you."
"Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance do anything with you
Well, I'm a walkin' down the road with my head in my hand
I'm lookin' for a woman needs a worried man
One kind favor I ask of you, allow me just one more chance
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your airplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train
Well, I'm lookin' all over for a gal like you
I can't find nobody, so you'll have to do
One kind favor I ask of you, allow me just one more chance
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance do anything with you
Well, I'm lookin' for a woman that well no man
Lookin' for a needle, that's lost in the sand
One kind favor I ask of you, allow me just one more chance"
"Come live with me and be my love
Come fulfill the dreams my heart's dreaming of
While the turtle dove calls to the mist as April rain falls
Oh come live with me and be my love
Come take my hand and walk with me
Unafraid to face whatever may be
While the wild woods murmur with the sweetest wind songs of summer
Oh come live with me and be my love
And say to me autumn leaves turned to gold
Stay and hold me in your arms when the world is cold
Come stand with me and be my love
While the candle shine and bells ring above
And forsake me never could be my love forever
Oh come live with me and be my love"
"I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town
Yes, I am, I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town
And just because I'm a stranger, you don't have to dog me 'round
Well, I wonder why some people treat the strangers so
Sometimes I wonder why some people treat the strangers so
I can't find a place to stay, lord, I just go from door to door
I'm gonna write home to daddy to send me my railroad fare
Oh, yes, I will, I'm gonna write home to daddy send me my railroad fare
And boys, if he can't send it, I don't mind walkin' there
Well, I'm goin' back home wear out 99 pair of shoes
Oh, yes, I am, I'm goin' back home wear out 99 pair of shoes
Well, when I get back home I won't have these old stranger blues"
"Just a high school kid with a strong arm
From throwing them rocks at an old barn
Got a full-ride shot, gonna be a star
No, it don't take much
Now he's got that old town facing
All the dreams that they quit chasing
Rusty chains are breaking
No, it don't take much
It don't take much,
A little gasoline,
A couple wildfire dreams, light 'em up
No, it don't take much,
Just the end of a rope,
Something you can hold and climb up
If you wanna be more than just where you came from,
Lord, it don't much
No, it don't take much
Just one more junior prom queen
She saw herself shining on a movie screen
But got knocked up at seventeen
No, it don't take much
Went from raising hell to a baby girl
From chasing bright lights to chasing curls
One midnight move can change the world
No, it don't take much
It don't take much
Have one too many
And before you're ready, you're under the gun
No, it don't take much,
Just one fast idea
Can lie and cheat ya outta being young
One drop of rain can turn into a flood
Lord, it don't take much
No, it don't take much
Oh, it don't take much,
A little gasoline,
A couple wildfire dreams, light 'em up
No, it don't take much,
Just the end of a rope,
Something you can hold and climb up
If you wanna be more than just where you came from,
Lord, it don't much
Oh, it don't take much
I've seen it all in my town
Some fly away and some fall down
The way it go, one thing I found
Is that it don't take much"
"I've been out on this highway of heartache
Hopin' that somewhere down the line
I could find someday who
Could rev me like you do
So grab onto my wheel
And I'll be fine
Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been runnin' on empty way too long
Honey you got the touch
That heats my motor up
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
I don't know where this road is gonna lead us
But what a beautiful night for a drive
Baby put your mind at ease
Drop the top and feel the breeze
Just follow all the signs to paradise
Take the keys to my heart
And drive me crazy
I've been runnin' on empty way too long
All that work under the hood
Sure has got it runnin' good
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Tonight we've gonna set these wheels on fire
And find out just how far this thing will go
Honey we don't need no map
'Cause where we are is where it's at
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Baby makes my motor yearn
I love to feel that rubber burn
Take the keys to my heart
And drive it home
Drive it home"
"Blow on you restless wind, up to your old tricks again
Bear down you texas sun, you make the desserts dry and the brush fires run
Splintered wood rusty chains, this old front porch swing remains
A pendulum of memories, goes back and forth on a summer breeze
Chorus:
Singing old church hymns and nursery rhymes
From the days way back before my time
With a little child upon my knee
Singing every sweet word back to me
Look how far I had to come
To get back where I started from
With a child's wisdom passin' time
Singing old church hymns and nursery rhymes
I've run the race I've walked the wire, I paid the price of my desire
And the only time I've known it all, is just before I took a fall
So howl your lone coyote song, fade to sapphire sky of dawn
Count me in the lucky men, to send the world around again
Chorus"
"Dogs are barking, birds are chirping
The only thing better if I was squirting
But there's no one here to love on me today
For the maiden's on holiday
For the maiden's on holiday
I'm a sorry, sorry knight in a horrible castle
Hoping to avoid certain societal hassles
And I know what they say
But I ain't made of clay
For the maiden's on holiday
Yeah, the maiden's on holiday
I ain't nothing but chivalrous
Ain't never been nothing nasty between us
She knows where she stands
On the heart of a broken man
I'm gonna be bad no matter what
So I might as well go on ahead
And act like a butt
Any ol' way, yeah, I'm still gonna pay
For the maiden's on holiday
Yeah, the maiden's on holiday"
"The first time we did it I was scared to death
She snuck out in that cotton dress
Jumped on in and we drove to the lake
Put her hand on my knee and said I can't wait
I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck
Turns out my baby loves to
Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
After that that's all she wanted to do
But that was okay 'cause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ain't bitin' she don't give up
Turns out my baby loves to
Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
I love to see her silhouette reflectin' off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
'Cause I found a girl who loves to
Fish, I love to see her lyin'
There on the bank 'neath the full moon light
Man, I can't even believe my luck
I found a girl who loves to
Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
Yeah, I know she loves to fish
Psst, you awake, let's fish"
"Bonnie look at the girdly I'll take a picture of you
Bonnie hold up the gun in your hand so deadly shiny and blue
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie
Bonnie smile at the camera for hist'ry we are a part of
Bonnie smile so the whole world will know a pretty the one that I love
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie mhm mhm mhm mhm

Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie
Somewhere in pages of hist'ry there's a picture of lovin' affair
A picture of Miss Bonnie Parker lovingly taken by far
Mhm mhm mhm mhm a picture of Bonnie"
"Castles were made high and mighty
And oceans were made deep and wide
We were made for each other, that's how I feel
About my love for you
Up in the sky is a rainbow
That some people say has no end
This I don't know it's true
But there's no end of my love for you
Living each moment, waiting for your touch
Praying each night, you'll want me half as much
Vows that are made are sometimes broken
And someone you trust and prove untrue
But I'll never be unfaithful
For you can trust in my love for you
You can trust in my love for you"
"You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me I'm just a lucky guy
Love to hear you say that
Love is love and though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me I'm just a lucky guy
Love to hear you say that
Love is love and though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time girl
We'll go on and on"
"He may give you diamonds on your birthday
And send you flowers now and then
He may put a new car in your driveway
Take you places you ain't ever been
He'll make you think that you're his one and only
But there's a big surprise in store for you
'Cause that man has an eye for every woman
Except for the one he's married to
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
You had best be watchin' every minute
'Cause someday he's gonna cross that line
It's been your game, but I'm about to win it
'Cause now the problems are yours instead of mine
So while you're livin' on all those promises he made you
I'll be havin' all the good times that you'll miss
And the day he don't come home and make love to ya
Is when you'll know he's had enough of wedding bliss
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
You're gonna wish you were still the other woman
You're the one who hears his alibis
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
And if you think you can keep him home
You got another thing comin'
'Cause there will always be
The other woman
The other woman"
"Verse:
It's hard describing a heartache, because its a one of a kind thing,
a erious injury and a whole lot of endless pain,
if it was a storm, i'd compare it to a hurricane,
awe, its even got a name,
Chorus:
If it was a drink it would be a strong one,
if it was a sad song, it would be long one,
If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue,
But if we're talking about heartache, it would be you
Verse 2:
If it was a full moon it would be a total eclipse,
if it was a tidal wave, it would sink a thousand ships,
if it was a blizzard, it would be record breaking cold,
if it was a lie, it would be the greatest story told,
Chorus:
If it was a drink it would be a strong one,
if it was a sad song, it would be long one,
If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue,
But if we're talking about heartache, it would be you"
"They say you've gotta lose a couple fights to win
It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting
They say that this is where the fun begins
I guess it's time that I was quitting
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
They said ""I hope that you will never change""
I went and cut my hair
They say ""Don't take your business to the big time""
I bought us tickets there, oh
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
What did you expect
And what did you forget
That to live you let go of me with each step
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again
But I don't want to fight
I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
So go home
Think it through
A jet plane and a big idea
I jump over the sea
What if's hot on my trail
But they can't catch me, no
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?"
"When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved word shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
[ guitar ]
On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of his resurrection share
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder...
[ guitar ]
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wonderous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder..."
"Ol' Jimmy, a real hard worker, loadin' trucks at the Feed and Save.
Well-liked, a really nice fella, that's why it's hard to believe.
One day, two counties over, he got caught with another man's wife.
Shots fired, smoke cleared, her husband took Jimmy's life.
In an instant, all the good stuff he'd ever done was all gone.
Now everybody just remembers the one thing that he did wrong.
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
Rob Jenkins, sittin' on the back pew, head bowed an' his eyes closed.
Preacher talkin' 'bout gettin' to Heaven, said, ""Brother would you like to go?""
White knuckles holdin' his Hymnal, while the choir sang Amazing Grace.
He stands up, full of conviction, turns 'round an' runs out of that place.
Off in his truck, says to himself, ""Next Sunday, I'm a-gonna get saved.""
Runs a red light, hit broadside an' next Sunday is way too late.
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
I'm gonna do right, an' make sure I ask forgiveness before I go,
I'm gonna take time, 'cause it's a fine line,
Between here an' ""You never know.""
You can have it all an' in the twinklin' of an eye,
It can all turn around.
If I live to roam this earth another hundred years,
Without 20 seconds from right now,
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
That ain't the way that I wanna go out.
No I don't wanna go out."
"Somehow you know just what it takes to please me
Sometimes I think that you can read my mind
And when the weigh of the world is on my shoulders
You're there to share my burdens everytime
If I could count the reasons why I love you
I'm sure there would be a million or two
And it'll curse to me that I can't live without you
And I've just found another reason for loving you
[ piano ]
I always start my days with lots of sunshine
It's in your smile and in your morning kiss
And more than once I've asked myself the question
How could any man ask for more than this
If I could count the reasons...
And I've just found another reason for loving you"
"[Chorus:]
I've got a whole lot of things to sing about
I've gotta whole lotta things to say
Like I love you and I need you
Every night and day
I've gotta a whole lot of things I want to do
I've gotta a whole lotta dreams to dream
And I want you here beside me
Every step of the way
I was lonely as anyone could ever be
Til you came along and gave your love to me
Now that empty world that you just walked into
Is filled with sunshine and music and the song is you
[Chorus]
People wonder just what has happened to me
They say I'm not at all the way I used to be
They don't realize I've just begun to live
And I'm wrapped up completely in all the love you give"
"Half of my mistakes I made stone cold sober
Half of my mistakes I've made at closing time
Half the time I never saw it coming, until it was over
Oh, and half of my mistakes I've made with love the line
Half of my mistakes I swear, I should've known better
Half of my mistakes were just amongst friends
You get a little distance on it, the truth is clearer
On, and half of my mistakes I'd probably make 'em again
Chorus:
If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much
but spend alot less time on right and wrong
and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I was moving to quickly
Half of them where made 'cause my heart was moving too slow
Nobody can tell you a damn thing, if you ain't listening
Oh, And half of my mistakes I've made 'cause I couldn't let go
Chorus:
If I it all to do over
I'm sure I'd win and lost just as much
but spend alot less time on right and wrong
and a lot more time on love
Half of my mistakes I'd give anything to change how it ended
Oh, and half of my mistakes, God, I wouldn't change one thing
You can lean too hard on a prayer but I don't recommend it
'Cause half the good things in my life came from half of my mistakes
Yeah, a lot of good things in my life came from half of my mistakes"
"Is it that time again?
Closin' time closin' in
Are they turnin' out the lights? Must I go home?
'Cause her memory
Is hauntingly
Waiting there to see I'm not alone
I know I just can't stand another lonely night
This man is going out, out of his mind
Since she left me behind
Since she left me behind
Am I the last one here?
Please, just one more beer
And I'll be on my way back to the blues
Back down lonely street
To a house that's peace
I'm nothing but a line of bad news
I know I just can't stand another lonely night
This man is going out, out of his mind
Since she left me behind
Since she left me behind
I know I just can't stand another lonely night
This man is going out, out of his mind
Since she left me behind
Since she left me behind"
"I wanta sing
About the things that make me happy
I wanta sing
About my brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy
I wanta sing
About the things that make me happy
But most of all
I wanta sing about you
I picked up my first guitar when I was just eleven
Listened to them grand old opry shows
Well, I cut my teeth on gospel songs and good old country fair
My favorites then were Acuff and Bill Monroe
What a beautiful thought I am thinkin'
Concerning that great speckled bird
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
They were the sweetest songs I ever heard
I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
I wanta sing about
My brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy
I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
But most of all
I wanta sing about you
I travel all over the world singing good old country music
It makes me feel so good to hear them cheer
Some like for me to sing the hits I do on the Grand Ole Opry
And after all that's why were really here
Well, my favorite songs that are sung today
Are like Rivelle and Williams
Boy, oh boy, they really were the best
And when they sang their songs
People laughed and cried by millions
And here's the ones today they all request
Always late with your kisses
But your cheating heart will tell on you
I love you, I'll prove it a thousand ways
And that's why I got the lovesick blues
I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
I wanta sing about
My brother and my mother and my sister and my pappy
I wanta sing about
The thing that make me happy
But most of all
I wanta sing about you
Yeah, most of all
I wanta sing about you"
"Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end
I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Where all my pieces fit
Chorus
Like a poor wayfairing stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Trying to find what feels like home
Well, that is no one can tell me
Am I doomed to ever roam
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
I'm just travelin' on.
Questions I have many
Ansewers but a few
We're here to learn the spirit burns
To learn the greater truth
We've all been crusified
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And when I'm born again
You're gonna see a change in me
God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain
Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumbling tumbling
As I'm traveling through
I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
I'm just traveling traveling
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Drifting like a floating boat
And roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord
Let me lean on you
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
Tryin' to find my own way home
Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through."
"Sniffin that cocaine all over town
Honey don't you let my deal go down
Hey hey buddy let that cocaine be
Strutin down the field walkin on main

"Laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Gentle roar of the wave on the shore
Makes its way through the crack neath the door
Wake up call from the ocean floor down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Tequila Sunrise with a coconut base, hammock swingin in the palm tree shade
Standard Island beach Resort cliche, hey, but thats okay
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Wind blowin on the back of my neck, sun reflectin off that tan on your breast
Found that feelin that we lost long ago down in Avid Cove
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key
Were laid back in Low Key, you and me on that white powered beach
Side by side with the sand and the sea, laid back in Low Key"
"Oh,
Well, I was born in a little bitty tar hut
And they called me a man 'cause I couldn't
Keep my big, big mouth shut
So what's the sense of me sitting here leaving
When any ole day I might be even
And Lord knows that New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find the way
To get it out of my grain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
Well I wish there was a way that
I knew to get even
A way to get a lick in
A bobbin' and a weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a leavin'
You can do on a train
Well, I once knew a man who sailed around
The world twice
He would have made it three but he took
A lot of bad advice
So you just tell me what's the sense of me
Sittin' here leavin'
When any ole day I might get even
And Lord knows New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find a way to get it out
Of my brain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
I wish there was a way that I knew to get even,
Way to get a lick in
A 'bobbin' and a'weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a'leavin'
You can do on a train
Oh, yes
Well, I once knew a man who sailed around
The world twice
But his motor cooled down and now he's
Deliverin' ice
Tell me what's the sense of him
Sittin' here leavin'
When any ole day he might get even
And Lord knows New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday he could find a way to get it out
Of his brain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
I wish there was a way that I knew to get even
Way to get a lick in
A 'bobbin and a'weavin'
And all the things besides goin' and a'leavin'
You can do on a train
Oh, yeah"
"I miss you already and you're not even gone
The time has come, you're telling me goodbye
I know that I can't stop you if I try
I've had way too many chances now, I'll have to set you free
I watch you go too late, I know how much you mean to me
Yes, I miss you already, I don't know how I'll go on
I miss you already and you're not even gone
So kiss me once again and please don't cry
And I promise there'll be no more alibis
I'll have to find myself a way to face this loneliness
I watch you go too late, I know I've lost my happiness"
"I've thought about it, I've analyzed it
You kissin' me verifies it
Ooh, there's something goin' on here
It didn't take too much insistin'
Baby you can be so convincin'
Ooh, there's something goin' on here
No it doesn't take a genius to figure it out
We have this connection
Don't need a psychic to tell us our future's pointed in the right direction
Well take a spin, so jump on in, let's get this thing in gear
I'm really thinking
We got something goin' on here
My friends are gettin' tired of hearin' me talk about you
Oh but honey that's all I wanna do
I go on and on and on about what's goin' on here
We're comin' pickin' up speed
A wildflower growin' from an itty bitty seed
There's something goin' on here
No it doesn't take a genius to figure it out
We have this connection
Don't need a psychic to tell us our future's pointed in the right direction
So here we go, it's an open road, I'm seein' the sign so clear
I'm really thinkin' that we got something goin' on here"
"[Chorus]
Where do you go when it rains in Mexico
Where do you hide when the bottom falls outta the sky
And, Who do ya love, when the one you love's been lovin' someone else
It ain't no fun, tryin' to have fun all by yourself
So, where do you go when it rains in Mexico
I got a watered down Margarita stuck in the sand
The little umbrella's a doin' the best that it can
Everybody said this is the place to set your spirit free
But, I came out, and the clouds came up and they poured down on me
So
I gotta wring out my shirt when I get back to the hut
I gotta find a place to dry off my coconut
There's a pretty little brown eyed girl flaggin' a taxi cab
She's alone, so she might know
Maybe I should ask
Hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
She supplied the transportation
I supplied the rum
When we got to the destination
I gave her some, rum
Now I know where to go when it rains in Mexico
Where to hide when the bottom falls outta the sky
And who to love, when the one you love's been lovin' someone else
It ain't been fun tryin' to have fun all by myself
So, where do you when it rains in Mexico
So, where do you when it rains in Mexico
Now I know where to go when it rains in Mexico!"
"I can't take any longer baby I mean I can't wait any longer
Mhm I gotta have you I gotta know how it is to touch you
To hold you to feel you our lives have touched our minds have touched
And I can't wait any longer for our bodies to touch our souls to touch
I can't wait any longer this feelin's gettin' stronger
Satisfy my hunger you're the only one who can
Where do I have to go what do I have to do
Who do I have to lie to so I can lie with you I can't wait any longer
[Strings]
Patience has never been one of my virtues baby when I want something I want it now
And I want you now I want to kiss you now I want to love you now
I can't wait any longer...
(I can't wait I can't wait doo doo doo) baby I can't wait any longer
I want you now hmm now yeah (I can't wait I can't wait...)"
"We sure can love each other when we try
Just like in all those love songs when we try
And some nights I love you so much contend to be beside you
And when I finally close my eyes the sun is high
But we sure can hurt each other when we try
We know all the ways to make each other cry
But when we forget compassion and to forgive is too old fashioned
We've let everything worth having pass us by
But we sure can love each other when we try
And I know we'll need each other till we die
And we'll grow old together you and I
Cause we sure can love each other when we try
Yes we sure can love each other when we try"
"I saddled me a wounded priest
Rode him wet through this august heat
I took me a german bride
All empty and bloody inside
In the dark I heard a thief
He stole my money and my grief
In the morning I wanted to die
The doctor cut me the lawyer lied
Stop yer waiting and just go
Don't be saying what you don't know
For the lowlands I am bound
Where my pale bride will be found"
"Walking on the velvet dream
Meadow clothed in mazed
To the Holy ground of love
Where two children met and kiss
Thru the window of my dreams
Floating from the past
I'm no willing prisoner of the
Gentle spell of Love you cast
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Or the hills of passing time
Runs a golden track
Love will always Rule my heart
My heart will always rule my head
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
MUSIC
The spirit of what's done still lives
In my beaten brain
Time and time may dim my eyes
But they'll never lay my love to rest
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Centuries come and go
All is change and turn
Maybe only god will know
But forever my Love will burn
Forever my love will burn
MUSIC
Centuries, Centuries, Centuries, Centuries."
"You wore out a brand new trunk
Packin' and unpackin' all your junk
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave
Well, this ain't right and that is wrong
You just keep naggin' all the day long
It's gonna stop, I don't mean please
Now you're gonna change or I'm gonna leave
The way to keep a woman happy and her do what's right
Is love her every mornin' and do the same at night
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a-gonna leave
Every time you get mad
You pack your rags and go back to what you had
You tell her lies she don't believe
You're gonna change or I'm gonna leave
You're gonna change your way of livin'
Change the things you do
Stop doin' all the things that you aughten too
Your mama's mad, she done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a-gonna leave
You're gonna change or I'm a-gonna leave"
"What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear,
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour still our refuge;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in Prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield thee;
Thou wilt find a solace there."
"There was a young man who had the best of everything
He was the first born of a wealthy man
But he was not satisfied with the best of everything
So he took his possessions in his hand
He traveled far and wide and he tasted worldly pleasure
But deep inside, he was lonely without measure
He wound up in a pig pen, nearly dead
Then he raised his eyes toward Heaven and he said
I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will beg him to forgive me for the fool I've been
I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will gladly be a servant if he'll take me back again
I was a young man who had the best of everything
I was the first born of a hardworking man
But I was not satisfied with the best of everything
So I took my possessions in my hand
I traveled far and wide and I tasted worldly pleasure
But deep inside, I was lonely without measure
I wound up in Las Vegas, nearly dead
Then I raised my eyes toward Heaven and I said
I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will beg him to forgive me for the fool I've been
I will arise and go back to my father's house
I will gladly be a servant if he'll take me back again?
So I did arise and go back to my father's house
I said, Father, I'm sick and tired of being alone
So I did arise and go back to my father's house
And then he wrapped his arms around me
And said, Son, you're welcome home"
"Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making bout just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun an paint the town
A love sick fool that's blind and just can't see
Oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me
She's out an fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blue
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh lonesome me
Well I bet she's not like me
She's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so
And brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back into my arms
Well there must be some way
I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh lonesome me
Oh lonesome me."
"I remember how the wood would smell
Just as the last great tree was felled
Like many that came before
It was used for table and a door
A palette and a long hall rack
Hung my great grandfather's hat
A stable and a barn, a bed and a seat
A roof and fence and a floor that creaked
And a coffin leanin against the wall
When there was a death in Arkansas
I liked the wagons and the wheels
The wind that knocked us down in the fields
And the girls with the southern drawl
And those that came before were the pictures on the wall
And the lone dogs howled and the crows would caw
When there was a death in Arkansas
We were laid to rest out under the sun
And we breathed our last
And it was done
And the air redeemed us and we would learn
That a life was hallowed and we wouldn't burn
Hands folded gently to say goodbye
It was just this place underneath the sky
Do you see our bones hidin like a toad
In the old red dirt that is now a road
Beneath the sign that blinks off on
And a shopping mall where the house is gone
Forgetting that a soul may call
When there is a death in Arkansas
And a quilten patch of new concrete
Helps the trucks roll down the street
There's a Dollar Store by the setting sun
And a sign on the church says His Will is Done
I can't see the birds or find the fields
That hold my bones beneath the wheels
And a mother worries that her son won't call
And a tv stares at a blinking wall
But the lone dogs howl and the crows still call
When there is a death in Arkansas"
"If you'll hold me close and kiss me promise that you'll always miss me
Say you'll never never never be untrue
If you swear you'll always love me and you'll place no one above me
Well then I'll give my heart to you
If I'm number one in your heart if you're sure that we'll never part
If you're ready now to make my dreams come true well then I'll give my heart to you
If you'll hold me close...
[ steel ]
Well if you're all through painting the town if you're ready now to settle down
If you're sure I'm the only one for you well then I'll give my heart to you
If you'll hold me close..."
"(Bruce Springsteen)
I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
>From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin' in the street
Tonight tonight the strip's just right
I'm gonna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street
He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around his baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels"
"Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fighting's and fears within without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind
Sight, riches, healing of the mind
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find
O Lamb of God, I come, I come
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come"
"The years creep slowly by Lorena snow is on the grass again
The sun is sinking low Lorena frost is where the flowers have been
The music softly plays Lorena happy sounds have left today
The music's sad and low Lorena where once it rang so loud and gay
I hardly feel the snow Lorena I know the darkness soon will pass
We'll sing our songs again Lorena you'll be in my arms at last
Yes you'll be in my arms at last"
"at a small caf
in a big city
sits a man
with his life in his hands
watch the nod of his head
his eyes heavy lidded
cause
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
there's a girl
with a smile
on a boat
with her brother
sailing for a visit of a year
she says goodbye to her home
and all things familiar
cause
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
take the train
back and forth
over the border
with suitcases piled overhead
will the officer scowl
and stop before passing
will he stop before passing
the world turns
the world it turns
the world turns on a dime
the world turns on a dime"
"Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleeping in the rain
Jesus said for sure
He's coming back again
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Ain't no tomorrow
Hold me with no eyes
Stand back away
And you'll wait for a ride
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Rub it in your blood
Rub it on your mind
When she wipes just flapping out of time
I seen some things I won't see again
It's all the same
It's all the same
I think it's gonna rain
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
Tobacco in the sunshine
Sleepin in the rain
Stand by the water
And you'll whisper something
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
Dynamite and whiskey
It's all the same
It's all the same"
"In the Texas town of San Antonio
Is a little church they call the Alamo
The story tellers say Ozzy Osborne stopped one day
All dressed up in women's lingerie
I don't know if the guy was drinking beer
Jack or beam it's not exactly clear
But when he whipped it out
The ghost of Travis gave a shout
Whose message all good Texans still can hear
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a source of Texas pride
Hell, John Wayne died inside
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
When Bowie and Young Crockett made their stand
Colonel Travis drew a line in to the sand
But it's simply not the same when you try and write your name
That bloody rocker must have mush for brains
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a simple Texas mission
Not a pot for you to piss in
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Music never rilled us
The groupies or the jets
The show on television
Or the ratings you might get
The thing that drove us plum insane
Was when you drained that old main vain
Took your snake and let it go
No, we won't forget the Alamo
The eyes of Texas are upon you
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
It's a symbol of our state
Not a place to urinate
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
How ya like it then
If we piss upon Big Ben?
Don't go there, don't go there
You really shouldn't go there
You'll really piss us off if you go there
Ah, you know Sharon I got me ****
Cloths off put in the roadie's rooms
So I couldn't get out
So I just took a walk around town, you know
And **** the next thing I **** know
I had to take me a piss, you know
And there was this old wall and I thinking
What the ****, I'll **** piss on the wall
Then all of a sudden
I'm in jail, you know **** police
Got me down and ah
Sharon, Sharon"
"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend
Well, he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking, I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy
Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high if we
Could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh, but listen to me talking, you'd think I wasn't grateful, why if you
Didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful
You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy
And that new preacher you sent us, Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well, I guess, I'll mosey on home now, Lord, I won't take no more your time
I guess, there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line
Evening to you, Lord, and watch us over tonight
Don't you worry about us now, Lord, 'cause everything is gonna be all right"
"When I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby my mommy would rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
Well when of them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Yes it was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Yes again in them old cotton fields back home
Well in them old I said cotton fields back home"
"Don't be sad
What we had was so fine
Before we go let's go back
To where we met the first time
One last time around the floor
And I'll hold you like I did before
Take my hand I'll ask our friend in the band
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight
If you want
I'll drive you home just once more
Park the car then arm in arm
Walk you to the front door
I'll just let the motor run
Leave the windows down just for fun
You never know what we'll hear on the radio
They might
Don't be sad
What we had was so fine
Before we go let's go back
To where we met the first time
One last time around the floor
And I'll hold you like I did before
Take my hand I'll ask our friend in the band
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight
If you want
I'll drive you home just once more
Park the car then arm in arm
Walk you to the front door
I'll just let the motor run
Leave the windows down just for fun
You never know what we'll hear on the radio
They might
Play something we can dance to
Play something nice and slow
Maybe while we're waltzing I can change you mind
While the lights are low
Hey mister steel guitar man can you make her cry
Play something we can dance to
Before we say goodnight"
"I'm driving in my car alone
You called me on the telephone
How many times will it take till I'm convinced
That you're using me, I'm just a used-to-be?
It's a lie, I know it's a lie
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Here I am again, it's four AM
I think I'll play that song again
The one called ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""
And I'll wonder where you are tonight
I don't know, I just don't know
But I just can't go on dying like this
Can I see you tonight?
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer
I'm just a fool I guess
But I just can't go on dying like this
Lord knows I just can't go on dying like this"
"I won't go lookin' for you tonight I'd rather stay here at home
Than to see you holdin' her so tight in your arms where I belong
I followed you so many times to the places where you go
I watch you kiss her secretly while the lights're turned down low
I thought that if I see you holdin' another I can find someone too
I get lots of chances but I don't even bother cause I'm too busy missin' you
So I won't go looking for you tonight I'll wait till you come in
And when it's me that's holdin' you I know you're mine again
[ steel - dobro ]
I thought that if I see you holdin' another..."
"He saw her after school, sippin' on a coke
Acted like a fool, crackin' crazy jokes
She turned his motor on, man his heart was gone
Fire down below, easy as you go
Easy as you go, steady as you fly
Keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye
Turn it on a dime, man you never know
Take a little time, whoa, easy as you go
Graduation night, out behind the stands
In the fading light he became a man
She discovered love better be enough
Cause baby's gonna grow, easy as you go
Easy as you go, steady as you fly
Keep it in the road, keep an eagle eye
Turn it on a dime, man you never know
Take a little time, whoa, easy as you go
Judgmental frowns, teacher's lookin' down
Parents all ashamed, passin' out the blame
They got a little room, service station view
The rents too high, pay's too low, whoa, easy as you go
Ain't nothing like a daughter or a son
To make a mama old and keep a daddy young
Make a body dream and give a life a theme
Take the highs and the lows, whoa, easy as you go
Easy as you go"
"Take up thy cross and follow Me
I heard my Master say
I gave My life to ransom thee
Surrender your all today
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
He drew me closer to His side
I sought His will to know
And in that will I now abide
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
My heart, my life, my all I bring
To Christ who loves me so
He is my Master, Lord, and King
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go
I'll follow my Christ who loves me so
Wherever He leads I'll go
Wherever He leads I'll go"
"Tell them other girl ""don't bother.""
'Cause come hell or high water,
You're the only one for me.
If they can't see I'm faithfully devoted to you,
Well then they don't have a clue.
'Cause girl I'm a juggernaut, and I'll never stop loving you.
Baby when we get to fightin'
You can take your love and hide it.
You can rage into the night,
When you're ready I'll be right here waiting for you.
Baby my love is true,
I'll be your juggernaut, yeah I'll never stop loving you.
When you're weak nearly broken,
When it's hard to keep on hoping,
Baby I won't break or bend.
Yeah the only way this ends is with you in my arms.
With you in my arms.
And I'm not saying maybe, I'm telling you baby,
I'll never leave your side.
You're my once and always bride,
The love of my life, my beautiful wife.
And I'm just a juggernaut, but I'll never stop loving you."
"Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach..."
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"Momma sure was right
In her preachins' on the backwoods life
She said it's sure as the sun goes down and the sun comes up
In the hearts of Hillbillies
And the souls of Big Cities
There's a common ground as strong as in God we trust
It's hip to be country,
Dope to be downhome
Alright to be righteous
Legit to get stuck and sling a little mud
It's fly to be the farmhand
Pimp to be the poor man
Cool to be free as the breeze
And hip to be country
It's as soakin' as rain
Smokin' as a coal train
It's stars and bars that bleed red, white and blue
It's the sound of a holler
Jumpin' in the muddy waters
And its why I hang my hat neath' an ole tin roof
Its hip to be country,
Dope to be downhome
Alright to be righteous
Legit to get stuck and sling a little mud
It's fly to be the farmhand
Pimp to be the poor man
Cool to be free as the breeze
And hip to be country
It's groovy to feel like me
And Hip to be Country"
"I've been ramblin' out Montana way
Tryin' to live on a cow punchers pay
Been changin' them dams in the new summer hay
Irrigating alfalfa for six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story I'd be on my way
But the savings are slow to come on six bucks a day
Out here in the fields while the water runs down
With the sun high above me and the sky all around
I'm dreamin' my dreams of the Canada line
And the places I'd go if the money was mine
I'll tell you my story...
Come Saturday night well you draw out some pay
Then you go into town just to throw it away
And when the end of the month comes rolling your way
Well you ain't got much left on six bucks a day
I'll tell you my story...
Now if I drew out my time and I paid off my debts
I couldn't get to Great Falls on what I have left
But I've got me no choice when them diesel horns blow
Come a wind from the highway I got to pack up and go
Yeah money or none at all they can't hold me this way
For my blankets are rolled and tied and I'm leavin' today"
"It's late in the evening
She wonders what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me
""do I look alright?""
And I say ""yes, you look wonderful tonight""
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
Walking around with me
And then she asks me
""do you feel alright?""
And I say ""yes, I feel wonderful tonight""
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say ""my darling, you were wonderful tonight""
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"
"Darling I've been standing here just watching you all night
And I think I've even caught you watching me a couple times
If I don't ask I'll never know
This may sound dumb but here we go
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Me neither I'm glad that we agree
Believe me that's a big relief
Well this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat?
Me neither
It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow
Darling tell me would you like to dance?
Me neither I was just bein' polite
Thank goodness my feet are much too tired
I'm sure your tired too
I can see an empty booth
Would you like to maybe sit and talk awhile?
Me neither
We'd never get along
I'm thinking there's no chemistry at all
This has been a waste of time
And I'm running out of lines
Don't you think it's time for me to end this song?
Me neither
(Ah here we go)
(Ah yeah)"

"She lives for the thunder, he lives for the rain
She was born in Manhattan, he grew up near Spokane
He found her sitting by the side of the road
Her long hair shining like that black Texas gold
They had nothing in common 'cept the need to move on
So they headed for somewhere further along
Dust devils were spinning out across the fields
That bridge was a burning underneath their wheels
That old muddy river was just running wild
For that western boy and a sweet Yankee child
She was more of a woman than any girl he ever knew
He had no idea what his world was coming to
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you, well, how 'bout you?
Love needs a fool
How about you, girl?
Old white picket fences by the side of the road
Hanging on broken hinges, too weak to take the load
Just like that old farm boy when he wrapped her in his arms
He knew he'd never hold her long enough
To tame that young girl's heart
But he loved her with a fever that went way across the line
By the time the sun was high she was holding on
Through the tears she cried
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you, how 'bout you?
Love needs a fool
How about you, babe?
You gotta be fool enough to believe in love
If you want love to believe in you
Love needs a fool
How 'bout you, well, how 'bout you?
Love needs a fool
How about you, babe, how 'bout you?"
"Getting used to losing you is not an easy thing to do
For anyone can see I'm missing you
I still hurt the same old way and it grows worse day by day
For I lie each time I say I'm getting used to losing you
I walk down the same old street meeting friends we used to meet
Trying not to let them know that I'm so blue
But I'm afraid my heartaches show yes I'm afraid they know
But I lie each time I say I'm getting used to losing you
Getting used to losing you..."
"Once in life, you'll meet someone who gives to you
The reason for that life is what some love can do
So now I'm armed for troubled time with all I knew
For I love you, my favorite memory
You gave me something time could never take from me
A light that guides me when life's dark and I can't see
But when I need a hand to hold, you'll comfort me
You'll always be my favorite memory
Your lips were sweet, your arms were warm, I tasted light
You'll have my heart all your dreams each night
Till something comes up yonder now and I must sleep
You'll always be my favorite memory
So now, don't cry, it's not goodbye, it's just so long
I'll take you with me where I travel from now on
But when I close my eyes at night and go to sleep
You're lying there, my favorite memory"
"Gulf coast highway, he worked the rails
He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing we've owned is this old house here by the road
And when he dies he says he'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
She walked through springtime when I was home
The days were sweet, our nights were warm
The seasons changed, the jobs would come
The flowers fade, and this old house felt so alone
When the work took me away
And when she dies she says she'll catch some blackbird's wing
And she will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
Highway 90, the jobs are gone
We kept our garden, we set the sun
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow
And once a year they come and go
At this old house here by the road
And when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
Yes when we die we say we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away together
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring"
"Yeah I see you over there makin' eyes at me
Like you don't wanna get caught
Where'd you get the cowboy on your arm
And where you want me to drop him off
I see you tryin' to hide that fire inside
But your hold me back's almost gone
Yeah it's about time I let cowboy know
That I'm a gonna take you home
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah I can tell by the way I took your hand
And then asked you to dance
He went all John Wayne in front of his friends
And said I don't think so man
Yeah all blowed up like a loud mouth pup
Never been in a junkyard fight
But if you're gonna bark at the big dog boy
Then you're gonna get to feel the bite
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can tell you what I got here on my mind
But I think you already know
Yeah and now's the time for you to turn around
If you want me to walk away
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah so keep on lookin' at me that way
That way we can move this along
I can finish sweepin' her off her pretty little feet
And your buddies can carry you home
You can back off and let her dance with me
And live to fight another day
Or you can keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
Yeah I love the way the sun's comin' through
And bouncin' off the small of your back
Yeah I know if I call in sick today
Boss man will have a heart attack
Yeah I knew it was over when she rolled over
And said baby why don't you stay
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that way
And keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on lookin' at me that,
Lookin' at me that, lookin' at me that way"
"Today I burned your old love letters I burned them slowly one by one
And before I'd light the flame I'd read them to try and find the wrongs I've done
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one broke my heart in two
And all alone it's left me weeping for the ashes of your letters tied in blue
Today I burned your old love letters I watched my dreams go up in smoke
I lived again those precious mem'ries I heard each tender word you spoke
The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one said that we were through
Our love is there among the embers in the ashes of your letters tied in blue"

John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four
And there was an air about him that one could not ignore
And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind
And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
I rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest
It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, I guessed
But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand;
And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand
Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three,
In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round;
And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
So, ""You want to be free,"" he said, ""Well, this is how you can.""
As he read from the Bible he held in his hand
We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look,
Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book
John Daniel told us all how we could be free
John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel, John Daniel, John Daniel
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Ooh, John Daniel, tell me where did you come from
Tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?"
"Chorus:
They learned readin', rightin', route 23
To the jobs that lay waiting in those cities' factories
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery
Have you ever been down kentucky-way
Say south of prestonburg
Have you ever been up in a holler
Have you ever heard
A mountain man cough his life away
From diggin' that black coal in those dark mines, those dark mines
If you had you might just understand
The reason that they left this all behind
Chorus:
They learned readin', rightin', route 23
To the jobs that lay waiting in those cities' factories
They learned readin', rightin', roads to the north
To the luxury and comfort a coal miner can't afford
They thought readin', rightin', route 23
Would take them to the good life that they had never seen
They didn't know that old highway
Could lead them to a world of misery
Have you ever seen 'em put the kids in the car after work on friday night
Pull up in a holler about 2 a.m. and see a light still burnin' bright
Those mountain folks sat up that late
Just to hold those little grandkids in their arms, in their arms
And I'm proud to say that I've been blessed
And touched by their sweet hillbilly charm"
"I was born in Mississippi
On the Gulf of Mexico
And I could hear the Gators a roar at night
Out on the old bayou
I remember Spanish moss
A hangin' from the cypress trees
And the smell of honeysuckle
On the Mississippi breeze
Thank you Mississippi for lovin' me
Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
Thank you for old cane pole, the fishin' hole
The grits and black eyed peas
Thank you Mississippi for lovin' me
Then my family moved down to Texas
When I was 12 years old
I took my first chew of plug tobacco
And got hooked on rodeo
I rode my buckskin pony
Where the old Red River flows
And my Texas pride still makes me cry
When I remember the Alamo
Thank you Texas for loving me
Thank you for the country road, the horny toads
The Chile and pinto beans
Thank you Texas for lovin' me
Now I live up in Wyoming
I love home out on the range
But every now and then my mind goes roamin'
Down those country roads through my boy hood days
And after all these years I'd just like to say
Thank you America for lovin' me
Thank you for givin' this country boy a place to dream
Thank you for the country roads, the folks I've known
From sea to shinning sea
Thank you America
Thank you mom and dad for lovin' me"
"I gave her that diamond she dreamed of,
And I bought her a home with a view.
I took her to the end of the rainbow,
But all I left her was blue.
Seems I never had time to love her,
And now it seems time just stands still.
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.
Now I'm here alone, after leavin' her lonely
Lord, I'm livin' with the memory I know I can't kill.
I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill.
Yeah, I thought I was king of the mountain,
But I was only a fool on the hill."
"I'm writin' this letter, my darlin, from high on a hill.
We've been marchin' ten days and we're just outside Hawkinsville.
It's been snowin' all night and we ain't got no more kersosene.
It's colder than hell,
Hope you're doin' well,
Josephine.
There's a fever in camp and our boys are too sick to fight.
We done lost ol' Calvin;
Weaver won't make it through the night.
I overheard the Captain say it's the worst he's ever seen.
I'm losin' some weight
but I'm still standin' up straight,
Josephine.
CHORUS
Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.
Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.
Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right
And just one more thing:
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.
There's three thousand Union troops camped at the river below.
And six hundred of us -
At least there was two nights ago.
Will Irwin deserted and
They hung him down by the stream.
Good God, I'm so scared,
Keep me in your prayers,
Jospehine.
The order came down: we attack tonight at nightfall.
If we can stop 'em right here
We can win this war, once and for all.
You know, I killed a Union boy last week -
Bet he wasn't fourteen.
He looked just like our son,
Forgive me for what I've done,
Josphine.
CHORUS
Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.
Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.
Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right
And just one more thing:
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.
And lastly, my darling, in case I should be killed...
Don't grieve me too long
Promise me that you will
Marry another and don't let him treat our babies mean,
And when he's holding you, won't you think of me too, Josephine?
CHORUS
Tell the children I miss 'em and wish I could kiss 'em once more.
Bet they've growed a foot since they waved me goodbye at the door.
Tell Mama and Daddy I'm all right
And just one more thing:
I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine.
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, Josephine."
"[On the CB.]
Breaker, one-nine, this here's the Duck again. You got a copy on me Pig Pen, c'mon? Ah, negatory, Pig Pen, there ain't no way out 'cept for that one Atlantic Ocean. Now listen, drop them hogs off in Omaha and get over here in a short, 'cause it definitely looks like we got us a problem.
Bears to the left; bears to the right
We didn't have no place to go.
They had us backed up clean to the shore,
And them cab-over Petes don't float.
I says, ""Pig Pen, I got me a good idea.
Them Friends a' Jesus gonna save us!
""So praise the Lord and Mister Ford,
And follow that micra-bus, ten-four.
[Now, imagine a bunch of rowdy pirates -- the buccaneer type, not software -- chanting the Chorus.]
[Chorus]
Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho, and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky!
Yeah, we drove on the water like diesel whales
Sank about a hunnert-and-ten of 'em
I says, ""Pig Pen, they just didn't have no faith
""They definitely gone ten-seven.""
By the time we got into that Piccadilly Town,
'Bout half of 'em was lost at sea
I says, ""Break one-nine for a ten-thirty-three""
What we got was the cotton-pickin' BBC
[Spoken, in a sorta British accent]
I say, Fabersham. Looks likes the Americans have got themselves another bloody Convoy.
[Chorus]
Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho, and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky!
[Spoken, in the same sorta British accent]
Good heavens! Look at them all! Half of them are sinking in the Thames! Hello! Some of our truck chaps are assisting them. Good show, actually. Oh, well, ten-four and all that rubbish.
Well, we crossed that Channel like snakes on glass
And stormed the beach about dawn
I says, ""Grab your shifters and punch 13
""We all goin' truckin' on the Autobahn.
""Now, Pig Pen, this here's the ultimate slab
""'Cause there goes a Mercedes truck.""
He says, ""Break one-three for the Strudel Machine
""Ya just blew the doors off'n the Duck. How 'bout it?""
[Spoken, in a sorta German accent. A really bad German accent.]
Oh, zehn-vier, Rubber Duck. Ve are receiving you vall-to-vall, but the schpeed limit on za Autobahn is triple-nickels. You travel too schlow, Rubber Duck. We gonna see you around. We gone. Wiedersehen.
[If you know the song, then you can skip this note. If you don't, then a bit of explanation is necessary. During the next verse, the chorus (the singers, not the words) is heard in the background. What they're singing is what's printed in the tiny little letters. No, I am not making this up. That's what they're singing.]
Well, we stopped for a coffee in West Berlin
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
The British had hundred-mile tea
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
I says, ""Pig Pen, from here on it's wall-to-wall bears.""
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
Says, ""Bash the Wall; we gonna see.""
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
Well, them big red bears must'a been in the bush
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
'Cause we didn't see a one all day
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
So we raked up the leaves and we shook out the tree
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
'Til they finally had something to say
Dumb, dumb, dumb.
You got it..
[Spoken in a bad Russian accent. A really bad... you know the rest.]
Comrade Duck: you have been given until daybreak in Murmansk to get your cotton-pickin' trucks out of the U. S. S. of R. You will copy!
[That 'dumb' chorus continues.]
Well, we shot them rigs through salt-mine city
Dumb, dumb
With a hammer and a sickle on down
Dumb, dumb
Then we hit the fan through the Sea of Japan
Dumb, dumb
Tooled into Transistor Town
Dumb, dumb
I says, ""Pig Pen, this here must be the place,
Dumb, dumb
""'Cause everybody's eatin' with sticks.""
Dumb, dumb
He says, ""Ten-Four, this here is CB land
Dumb, dumb
""'Cause my channel knob just went crick.""
Dumb, dumb
[Spoken in a really bad Japanese (fill in the blank)]
Ah so, Lubba Duck. You have a nice day today, betta day tomollow. We catch you on frip-frop. This one Kamikaze Ozzie; we gone. Sayonara.
[Chorus]
Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Lubba Duck
Yo ho ho, and a rots a' ruck
'Round the world with a Lubba Ducky!
[Obviously, poritical collectness hadn't yet permeated the U. S. of A. :)]
[On the CB.]
Ah, ten-four, Pig Pen, what's your twenty? Australia? Mercy sakes, ain't nothin' down there but Tasmanian devils and them Q-alla bears. What's that? No double-nickel limit? We gonna be there in a short, Pig Pen. This here's the Rubber Duck, ten-ten and doin' it to it like Pruitt used'ta do it to it. We gone. 'Bye-'bye."
"A candle on the windowsill
Burning bright, burning still
Need you home, it lights the way
There today like yesterday
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And it don't matter where you've been
Through the thick and through the thin
Say a prayer, say my name
I am the keeper of the flame
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
All your secrets have a home
They won't be traded, it won't be so
Whisper softly in my ear
When you want 'em, they are here
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins
And you don't have to explain
I got your blood running through my veins"
(Instrumental)
"I saw mom with God last night
I was mad when God took you from me but last night I could plainly see
That he saved you from lots of misery
A smile upon your face told me you were happy as you could be
I'm a gonna ask God if he'll save a place for me
Mother dear sweet precious mother mother (sweet precious mother)
I saw you with God last night
He was holding to your hand showin' you around in the Promised Land
I saw you with God last night
[ dobro ]
Gonna write two letters to the heaven's blue one to God and one to you
I'm a gonna thank him for bein' so nice to you
I've been cryin' since you went away but not one tear I've shed today
Cause I know now you're happy up there in the heaven's blue
Mother dear sweet precious mother..."
"'Silent Night', 'Snowy Night', 'The First Noel' alone
The only 'Jingle Bells' 'round here are on the motel phone
She calls me, comforts me, holding back a tear
She's wishing on that yonder star and I'm missing Christmas here
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn
Christmas Eve used to be a peaceful dream of joy
But as I toss and turn tonight, I hear a scuffled noise
What's that, it can't be, it sounds kinda like reindeer
But I really doubt the bearded one makes deliveries here
At the Holiday Inn, no tinsel or mistletoe
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends
And I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn
I look out the peephole, I can't believe what I see, yeah
It's my baby in a Santa hat and she's smilin' at me
She brings in a two foot tree and hangs a wreath on the wall
Looks like it's gonna be a very merry after all
Holiday Inn with tinsel and mistletoe
Holiday Inn, one bed and HBO
The whole world is rejoicing with family and friends
And we're watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the Holiday Inn
Yeah, and it's a wonderful life at the Holiday Inn"
"He sits alone in his perfect shack
the lake beside him freezing
the sun no longer shining
much past four oclock.
We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones
She falls asleep, the book on her lap,
all things change to something new,
something strange.
We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones
We walk along with my hand on your back,
the days behind receding
forward to a day when all we love will pass.
We are the selfish ones
We are the lucky ones
We are the needed ones
He sits alone in his perfect shack
the lake beside him freezing
the sun no longer shining
much past four oclock."
"You left me and you went away
You said you'd be back and just that day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now darling you know I love you well
I love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you loved me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks in two
Walking the floor over you"
"I hear your favorite music on the jukebox
And right away I know that you are here
You always pick a time just when I think
My mind is clear you reappear
And once again you've got me in your power
This time I hope it's not a brief romance
Cause it's too late to run
You've got me thinking one slow dance
Is worth a chance
Then that old blue magic
Still works like a charm
As if you never even left
These aching arms
You put a spell on me
I guess I'll always be hypnotized
By that blue magic in your eyes
Though I should run and hide from this illusion
Your smile is so much quicker than my pride
There's something up your sleeve
That makes my heart believe inside
This carpet ride might lift us up
And fly us to forever
But up till now
It's all been slight of hand
I've got to face the fact one look and
I'm right back again at your command
Cause that old blue magic"
"Oh, you drive me crazy.
I can't stop the way I feel.
Things you do don't seem real.
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time.
Just turn loose and let it be,
This waitin' 'round is killin' me.
You drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I can't get any rest. People say that I'm obsessed.
You're everything I want in life, but to me that's no surprise.
And what I have I'll give to you.
I hope you feel the same way, too.
'Cause you drive me crazy
Like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I won't make it on my own.
No one likes to be alone.
You drive me crazy, yes it's true.
I'd give it all up just to be with you.
'Cause you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself, I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, can't help myself.
I'm gonna hold you all night long.
And I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home.
Drive me crazy like a rock in my shoe.
I can't keep my mind off-a you.
Drive me crazy and that's a fact,
You're the one that's a makin' me feel like that.
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, I'm a lunatic.
I'd do anything for your sweet kiss.
Drive me crazy, can't help myself.
Drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, oh you drive me crazy."
"If there's a chance that your heart misses the words I try to say with kisses
If I don't seem to look as happy as I should
I wouldn't want to live without you I love everything about you
Yes even the bad times are good
Your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
Even in my darkest moments you make it easier to see
I wouldn't change one thing about you if I knew that I could
Yes even the bad times are good
You never let me feel mistreated your love is all I've ever needed
When I was weak somehow you always understood
You're not afraid of stormy weather and that's what keeps our love together
Yes even the bad times are good
Your middle name should be perfection
Even the bad times are good"
"Baby please don't get too close to me
Cause that ring you're wearin'
Says that you're not free
But if I said I didn't want ya
Well you know I'd be a liar
You better run while there's still time
Cause I can't stop this fire
I want you bad I can't help myself
But you belong to someone else
I'd leave you alone, darling, if I could
But I want you bad and that ain't good
Baby please put away those ruby lips
And those big blue eyes
Are too hard to resist
I'm not that kind of man
Oh and usually I'm strong
But it's gettin' hard to tell between
What's right and what is wrong
I want you bad I can't help myself,
I want you bad girl that ain't good
I want you bad bad bad that ain't good"
"On a two lane north of Casper is where this all begins
Heading back to Oklahoma for a week to visit friends
She was walking 'long the highway so I pulled off to the side
And asked her if she needed a ride
We tore up that ole blacktop 'til we found I-25
And just into Colorado she asked if she could drive
I'd never met nobody like her. I'd never laughed so much
And I grew hungry for her touch
(Chorus)
I used to think of autumn
As sweaters and leaves
And I used to think the night
Was just for dreamers and theives
But that was before she came
Allison Miranda was her name
By the time that we hit Kansas we both felt pretty beat
So we found ourselves a motel and grabbed a bite to eat
We'd rest a few short hours; soon we'd be out of there
Three days later we came up for air
(Repeat Chorus)
Now I can't forget the morning when I woke alone in bed
To a rose left on her pillow and a good-bye note that read
You cannot grow a flower if you do not have the seed
Now I've got everything I need
(Repeat Chorus)"
"Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too
Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm fallin' in love with you
Just like you I'm wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Just like you I'm wonderin' what's goin' on
Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
The night will soon be gone
Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too
Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?
I'm fallin' in love with you
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
I know that you're gonna be mine one of these days
Wallflower, wallflower
Take a chance on me
Please let me ride you home
Wallflower, wallflower
Won't you dance with me?"
"Hey, California you don't know me, New York City you can't show me
Anything I haven't seen at least a hundred times before
I still love you, New Orleans, Mississippi River Queen
?Cause when it comes to lovin' you beat all I've ever seen
And I've seen a lot of ladies in my time
I've had me a few women that were fine
Ah, but I don't need no city woman messin' with my mind
So goodbye San Francisco girl, I'm leavin' you behind
And I've had some senoritas down in Mexico
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho
I've had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose
If the good Lord made any better that you
He's the only one who knows"
"Like a bird that's lost its mate in flight I'm alone and oh so blue tonight
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea may you never be alone like me
I believed the lies you told to me when you said my dear I worship Thee
Now here am I alone and blue all because I loved no one but you
[ steel ]
I gave up my friends I left my home when you promised to be mine alone
Now you're gone our love could never be may you never be alone like me
In the Bible God's own words to say for every wrong someday you'll pay
I pray the Lord to set me free may you never be alone like me"
"As you read this letter that I write to you
Sweetheart I hope you understand
That you're the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
Sweetheart I beg you to come home tonight
I'm so blue and all alone
I promise that I'll treat you right
Love, oh love oh please come home
That old wind is cold and slowly creeping 'round
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
Your baby's hungry sick and cold"
"I often sing, for those I love
Who go to live, with Christ above
No more on earth, their forms I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
'Til I too, must say goodbye
Just over there, with Christ I'll be
Get all my friends, to sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
As I so oft, for friends have done
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me"
"You say you're sorry once again dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that's what you told me once before
Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know you soon will find a new love
I feel your heart is turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
For loneliness moves in as you move on
Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine"
"I never dreamed her footsteps could ever sound so lonely
As they did as she left today
I raised my hand and brushed your tear as I helplessly stood there
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever she said with her eyes but her soft lips had nothing to say
I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be standin' in this doorway
Watching my world walk away
I'm leaving forever
I never thought I'd live to see
Watching my world walk away"
"Last night like every night before
I felt your body close to mine
You woke me with a gentle kiss
And we lost all track of time
You held me tightly in your arms
As we shared ourselves till dawn
You consumed me with desire
Till I woke up all alone
This dream I dream of you
Is drivin' me insane
I barely close me eyes
And you're holdin' me again
I know if I give in to you
By mornin' you'll be gone
And leave me with that old refrain
Just one night of love
Ain't worth the pain
Today I saw you on the street
And desire filled my mind
I longed to have your touch again
And leave all doubts behind
But you still wore her wedding ring
And my conscience took control
I'd give all I've got to be with you
But I won't give up my soul
This dream I dream of you
Is drivin' me insane
I barely close me eyes
And you're holdin' me again
I know if I give in to you
By mornin' you'll be gone
And leave me with that old refrain
Just one night of love
Ain't worth the pain"
"Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the road
Blues on the table
There's blues every week
Pouring out of the coffee pot
With the first cup of the day
Oh, the first cup of the day
Now where are my friends
When I'm taking the heat
Only help I got today
Was from a stranger on the street
Oh, a stranger on the street
And why would you laugh
If you wanted to cry
And why would you say things
If you knew it was a lie
Oh, you knew it was a lie
Dark was the night
Cold was the ground
I couldn't sleep
So I got up and walked around
Oh, I got up and walked around
And I walked into Dallas
Crying all the way
Running over in my mind
Everything I meant to say
Oh, everything I meant to say
Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Been too much time now
Too many nights on the road
Oh, too many nights on the road"
"I worship the ground that you walk on I breathe every breath for you
I live every day to make you happy yes I've got it bad for you
I hurt every time someone hurts you I cry every time they make you blue
I live every day to make you happy yes I've got it bad for you
I know I'd die if you ever should leave me for my whole world turns around you
I live every day to make you happy yes I've got it bad for you
Yes I've got it bad for you"
"I said, ""I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston""
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole ""nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pullin' up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinkin', ""Who am I kiddin'""
I ain't goin' nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole ""nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing that changes everything"
"An empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends
Every night for me
Every night I'm in some bar
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same
With an empty glass
That last cigarette
It's closing time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
That's how my day ends

Every night I'm in some bar
Pouring whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing

That's how my day ends
Every night for me.
Yeah, that's how my day ends
Every night for me"
"You tell me you love her with all of your heart
And there's no room left there for me
But someday if she'll hurt you and your whole world falls apart
I'll take a left over corner of your heart
Just a left over corner of a heart not much as true
But it just goes to show how much I want you
For I'd give my heart full of true love for tiny little start
In that left over corner of your heart
[ strings ]
Just a left over corner..."
"Love for me hasn't been easy
I've let true love fall to the ground
Through the years and the tears
I've learned what love's about
And this time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
Too many times I've lost a good love
And I can see now I let it down
But if love comes back to me
It won't see the same old me
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around
When love comes around I'll be ready
Love will find me a brand new man
And I'll be standing here
With my heart in my hand
This time I'll be ready
When love comes around"

Walkin' boss
Walkin' boss
Yes you're the boss
But I don't belong to you.
I belong
Yes, I belong
And I can get along
With that steel drivin' crew

For a job
I said I wanna job
He said ""Son, what can you do?""
I can line track
I can line up track
And I can pull a jack
I can pick and shovel too.

One hard day

"Well here we again me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy he's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells where we gonna go
Ah you'd think by now he'd know
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are
Pile three in my truck the rest will follow us and we'll head downtown
Ah we all know the drill hit Jack and Jill's then the Cavalier Lounge
Jimmy you run in and look around
And we'll know if you don't come out
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are
If we gotta cross the county line
Oh you can bet we're gonna find
Where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Ah where the girls are where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and the games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a heart where the girls are

Where the girls are

"I'm country
Well there's a little word and it fits me to a t
I don't know how you spell it but its country and that's me.
I laugh when I'm happy and cry when I'm blue
'cus when I'm mad like I'm suppose to do
On a Saturday night I'll have a drink or two
And hollow at the moon I'm country.
I chew tobaccer and spit it on the ground
Talk to the cows when no one ain't around
I'm trapped on the mountain when the snows falling down
Yes sir boys I'm country
[Chorus]
I'm as country as bronc on the western plains
Just as wild and twice as hard to tame
As high on living as a noon day sun, yea
I'll be country 'til the day I'm done.
City folks think I'm crude I guess
You can tell I'm a hick by the way I dress
But that don't matter I'm as happy as can be
And proud as heck that I'm country.
Well there's nothing wrong with city if you like it that's fine
Drivin' them freeways wasting its time,
But I bet you folks in the back of your mind, kinda wish you was country don't
[Chorus]
Come on boys keep singing them country songs who knows maybe we will just
Convert some of these city folks into country folks and they'll all move out to
The country and then the country won't be country anymore. hold on
I just gave you one side to the whole picture because
Country is heart and dust and snow where the winters get down to forty below
And the works is hard
And the pay sure low and it ain't all roses being country.
Hang in there folks don't do nothin' foolish now
You got yourself a nice high paying job air conditioned offices
Yea you got movie theaters right on down the street there
You got yourself a city park too, now that's country
And there you don't have to worry about no rattle snakes biting on your leg
Or no abdominal snowman coming down and tearing off your head or nothing like
That there"
"When he turned 18
There was only one thing
That he'd think about all the time
With a scoop on the hood
And a thundering roar,
When you power shift overdrive
Up on the hill
With a head full of dreams,
""That'll be me one day""
When the chequered flag
Would bring 'em all home,
This is what the kid would say
Now he's 25 got his own car,
No. 1 painted on the side
He may be young and he may be small,
But you ought to see him drive
Tearing it up through Conrod straight,
Tyres chirpin' every gear,
If you listen close
To what the kid's got to say,
This is what you're gonna hear
Now I've got my wheels watch me drive right by, You can eat my dust and try to keep up
Man I'd like to see you try, I'll have my pedal
To the metal my claw to the floor
And I'm always out sight, Now I got my wheels
And I won't even wave goodbye
(And this is me waving goodbye)"
"You gotta walk that lonesome valley,
You gotta walk it by yourself,
Nobody here can walk it for you,
You gotta walk it by yourself.
Some people say that John was a Baptist,
Some folks say he was a Jew,
But your holy scripture tells you
That he was a preacher too.
Daniel was a Bible hero,
Was a prophet brave and true,
In a den of hungry lions
Proved what faith can do for you.
There's a road that leads to glory
Through a valley far away,
Nobody else can walk it for you,
They can only point the way.
Mamma and daddy loves you dearly,
Sister does and brother, too,
They may beg you to go with them,
But they cannot go for you.
I'm gonna walk that lonesome valley,
I'm gonna walk it by myself,
Don't want to nobody to walk it for me,
I'm gonna walk it by myself."
"Hard luck poppa counting his toes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Hard luck poppa don't do his stiff
Trouble with him he's been too rough
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Two old maids a-sitting in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Two old maids done lost their style
If you want to be lucky, you got to smile
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Early to bed and early to rise
And your girl goes out with other guys
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
If you don't bvelieve me, try it yourself
Well, I tried it and I got left
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
Hard luck poppa standing in the rain
If the world was corn, he couldn't buy grain
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues
His knees knock together but he's raing to go
Lord, lord, got those Brown's Ferry Blues"
"Just like the trees along the river bend
Lift up their branches to the sun above
We spend our lifetime reaching for a friend
'Cause everybody needs someone to love
Everybody's reaching out for someone
Everybody's knocking at some door
And long before I ever found you
You're the one that I was reaching for
I wanted you since the day my life began
I've heard your footsteps running just beyond my mind
Ever since the moment I've been reaching for your hand
Hoping you'd be reaching out for mine
Everybody's reaching out for someone
Everybody's knocking at some door
And long before I ever found you
You're the one that I was reaching for"
"Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He's got a heart of gold, right hand like a vice
Same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night
Barbed wire tough and cowboy cool
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand, the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
They say there's things about him that you see in me
He's the kind of man I want to be
Got to give the man credit where credit is due
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
He was the first to hold your hand, the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, and girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man, oh but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots"
"Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping,
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping,
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love.
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing,
If you listen with your heart, you'll hear them singing.
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping,
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love.
Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you,
Although you're many million dreams away.
Each night I 'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you,
To hasten every lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day.
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow,
But the memories we share are there to borrow.
Vaya Con Dios, my darling,
May God be with you, my love."
"It's hard to hide a lingering disappointment
But most of the time I wear it well
But there are times when I just can't help remembering
The night you left, that rainy night when my whole future fell
Rainy nights and memories go together
And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain
The blowing wind that moans outside my window
Seems to echo the closing of a door
For it was then I first realized, I had heard your last goodbye
And my whole world went crumbling to the floor
Rainy nights and memories go together
And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain"
"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"

"I got the hungrys for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well I ain't got nothing but the shirt on my back and an old two button suit
I walked out on my job about a week ago and I'm sleepin' in a telephone booth
But I'm a gonna be the richest guy around the day you say you're mine
I got the hungry's for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
When I first saw you babe you nearly made me wreck my old 49 Cadillac
I knew at a glance that it was you for me and I had to have your love by heck
I'm gonna follow you baby wherever you go I got nothing to lose but my time
I got the hungry's for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Well you made me the top dog on your hill and I was overjoyed
But it didn't take long till the thrill was gone I joined the ranks of the unemployd
Now I'm right back where that I started from but that ain't gonna change my mind
I got the hungrys for your love and I'm waitin' in your welfare line
Yes I'm waitin' in your welfare line"
"Here we are again and you sure look fine
You smile at me and the sparks just fly
I can't understand why this is taking so long
Somebody must have really done you wrong
'Cause everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
He hurt you bad, and your heart still aches
But why should we pay for his mistakes
Ohhh why
I don't know what he did but he's long gone
Well he must have really done you wrong
'Cause everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
I wanna tear down the walls that you built up
And baby open your heart to all my love
everytime I reach for you,
You hold back and I'm so confused
How can you pull away from something so strong
Somebody must have really, really
Somebody must have really done you wrong
somebody must have really done you wrong
Somebody must have really done you wrong
Done you wrong, really, really, really done you wrong"
"You know I don't think much about her anymore seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone Lord it's better forgotten
Like the poison red berries to die on the vine
This mornin' at dawn I pulled into town
Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at all the good times they remember and then I remembered the time
I can still see those bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I really didn't suppose that I'd never forget her and you know it took such a long time
But I don't think much about her no more seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone it's better forgotten
It's like a poison red berry that clings to the mind"
"Don't call my name out your window, as I'm leavin'
'Cause I won't even turn my head
And don't send your kin folk to give me no dang talkin'
'Cause I'll be gone like I said
You'd can say the same ole things
That you've been sayin' all along
Just lay there in your bed
And keep you mouth shut 'till I'm gone
No, Don't give me that old familiar, cry n' cuss n' moan
Understand your man
Oh, Understand your man
huh.
Oh, party boys
You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I untangle my mind
No, I ain't gonna repeat what I said anymore
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before
Yet, I'll be as gone as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man (meditate on it)
You'll understand your man (You hear me talkin, now?)
Understand your man (I told you so)
Understand your man
Huh,
Oh hu.
Understand your man
Understand your man
Understand your man
Understand
Understand your man..."
"When I'm low in spirit I cry Lord lift me up I want to go higher with Thee
But nothing grows high on a mountain so He picked out a valley for me
And He leads me beside still waters somewhere in the valley below
And He draws me aside to be tested and tried in the valley He restoreth my soul
It's dark as a dungeon and the sun seldom shines
And I question Lord why must this be
Then He tells me there's strenght in my sorrow and there's victory in trials for me
Then He leads me beside still waters
Down in the valley He restoreth my soul"
"My darlin come to me
Sit you down easily
And rest awhile
Near the soft fire light
Cold as the night
But warm is my heart with pride
Having you by my side
You're still my guiding light
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways,
The rock I lean on,
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
Time from me passes on
And I'm growing old
A lifetime nearly gone
I cannot unfold
Night dark and cold
But warm is your hand in mine
Feeble with ageless time
The light of love still shines
After all these years
Your soft assuring ways,
The rock I lean on,
Saw me through my darkest days
When all hope had gone
You're still the only one
I'll ever hold near
And I still love you
After all these years
I still love you
After all these years"
"When the rodeo was over, we're all go to the room.
We're drink some beer relax awhile and sing some cowboy tunes.
That old guitar we passed around, it was battered, scratched, and
Broke.
But lord it sounded mighty fine, when john ed sang ""cowpoke""
Ben he'd think of some old tune, and he'd really wail away.
Dunder'd play the spoons and sing until the break of day.
Clyde he'd tell a poem or two and old rich he'd crack a joke.
But damn it nearly make you cry when john ed sang ""cowpoke""
Someday this road I travel, lord I will leave behind.
But memories of the things I've seen will never leave my mind.
On a quiet summer's evening when the sun is sinking low,
I'll think again of days gone by when john ed sang ""cowpoke""."
"I think I'll go back down to New Orleans
Try to bury my travelin' bone
Unpredictable me, like I swore I would be
Nothing's ever written in stone
There's a knock on her door, is she here anymore
I guess me and the neighbors will see
If the one thing that I couldn't do without her
She couldn't do without me
Could I leave her behind, go on losin' my mind
While the good times continue to roll
With this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone
Take a good look around, this is New Orleans
A free wheeler's got to feel right at home
But it's a hell of a leap, whether shallow or deep
That old river's gonna keep movin' on
Like that muddy Mississippi, she keeps pullin' me under
When you're in it, nothin' ever seems clear
I could stand on the bank just toss in my line
But there's way too many fish around here
Could I leave 'em behind for the one on the line
Are the good times still gonna roll
And with this time on my hands, I can change all my plans
And it really wouldn't bother a soul
I can make all the rounds, paint all the towns
Do all that and more on my own
But a man can't survive on happiness alone"
"Looky there who's a comin' see the reindeer a runnin' ol' Rudolph sleddin' away
Hear the rattle of the hoofs as he ride on the roof oh tomorrow is Christmas day
See the funny little man with the sack in his hand filled with toys all bright and gay
But don't be afraid because it's only ol' Santa Claus and tomorrow is Christmas day
Here he comes down the chimney with a great big grin
A beard on the tip of his chinny chin chin
You better be a sleepin' or he won't come in
For tomorrow is Christmas day hey tomorrow is Christmas day
Well he fills all the stockings that's a hangin' on the tree
And he places all the presents with their ought to be
He's got a book for you and a tie for me oh tomorrow is Christmas day
And with a twinkle in his eye you know wave goodbye he hurries right on his way
He's gotta take a lotta toys to all the girls and boys for tomorrow is Christmas day
Here he comes down the chimney
Hey tomorrow is Christmas day"
"You've sure got a real nice place
So don't take this the wrong way
But I can tell by your decorating taste
You've been alone too long
You've got more candles than a midnight mass
That fancy mirror adds a touch of class
But do you know how good a mounted bass
Would look there on that wall
[Chorus]
You need a man around here
You can't do it all by yourself
To me it's painfully clear
That you could use a little help
Someone to kill the spiders
Change the channel and drink the beer
Seems to me that you sure need
A man around here
Thumbing through your stack of magazines
I don't see a Maxim or Field and Stream
I haven't been in a room this clean
Since they took my appendix out
Well you've gotta be kidding me
Don't tell me that thing is your TV
My laptop's got a bigger screen
Baby there ain't no doubt,
[Chorus]"
"I'll go back to her where I'm wanted
And maybe I can make up for the wrong
In spite of all I've done she still wants me
So I'll go back to her where I belong
Walking out on her wasn't easy
But without a second thought I left her there
I gave my all, I did it all to please you
But the more I seemed to do the less you cared
So I'll go back to her where I'm wanted
And maybe I can make up for the wrong
In spite of all I've done she still wants me
So I'll go back to her where I belong
You were playing games from the beginning
And any fool could plainly see that you have won
She's waiting there and there's nothing here to keep me
And if you can, then I can live with what we've done"
"By now I guess she's wondering how I'm doing
If it broke my heart when she told me goodbye
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
I bet she don't think I'm going miss her
Probably think she's always on my mind
But every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
She believes that I can't live with out her
And it hurts so bad sometimes I almost die
Well, every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
You know I'll bet way down deep
That she thinks that I'll always love her
And I'll bet she thinks I'll never love another
No matter how hard I try.
'Cause every night I sleep just like a baby
I wake up every hour and cry.
Lord, every night I sleep just like a little bitty baby
I wake up every hour and cry..."
"Now that I Know everything that I know is wrong
Am I right if I say I didn't know that you knew all along
Put me on the hot seat, put me on the spot
Tell me I'm in trouble or tell me I'm not
It feels so good I might be right where I belong
Right where, right where I belong
It feels so good I might be Right where I belong
In and out of love I wonder what I thought I was doing there
It might be a different story if anything but Life was fair
If its dog eat dog and cat eat cat
I might never see the light until I eat my hat
I'm caught between day and night and pretty mama I don't care
Right where right where I belong
I feel so good I might be Right where I belong
Right where right where I belong
It feels so good I might be Right where I belong
If you tell me I'm crazy baby that s all right with me
Cause Crazy in Love is crazy as a man can be
You can tell me this is dreaming or its all in my head
You can tell me that I'm dying or already dead
But It feels so good I might be right where I belong
Right where right where I belong
It feels so good I might be Right where I belong"
"Saw a man out on the street today, his whole life in a box
Someone must'a loved him once, right now, he just feels lost
I don't know where he's headed, Can't tell where he's been
God, I wish that I could say to him, you can start your life again
If you can find somebody
You can love more than you
You gotta hold on, hang on, whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothin'
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything, when love is all you've got
A family prayin' beneath a bridge, I don't know how they do it
Their shoes and clothes were all but gone
But their faith'll get 'em through it
Oh, you know there's somethin' special, about a mother and a father
Who can teach their kids to love, when others might not bother
So when you find somebody
You can love more than you
When the rain stops raining and the sun shines through
And when it feels like you've got nothing
And your world is all but stopped
You'll still have everything, when love is all you've got
Maybe there's a miracle, your name's been written on
Maybe it's been standin' right beside you all along
So when you find somebody (find somebody)
You can love more than you. (more than you)
You gotta hold on, (hold on) hang on, (hang on) whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothin'
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything. You still have everything
When Love is all you've got"
"Old Badger was an outlaw that no man could ever ride
So tough the devils pitch fork couldn't penetrate his hide
To beat him was the dream of every cowboy in the land
But try they might as sure is right they'll wind up in the sand
A brag came up from Texas by the name of Too Oaks Tall
Was out to get old Badger cause old Too Oaks rode 'em all
He said he'd tie a granny knot in Badger's twisting tail
So thousands came to stake his claim or to see how bad he'd fail
A mighty crowd had gathered with old Badger in the cute
The stirrups felt the boating weight of Too Oaks heavy boots
Then the cute swang open and the crowd began to roar
Cause shirt tail feet upon the seat like waves upon a shore
They circled that area Badger pawing out his hate
But Tall stuck in the saddle like his tail was made of paste
Badger then exploded as his hooves beat on the air
But Tall did stay like children's play in grandmas rockin' chair
The outlaw's eyes were blazin' and old Talls face was turnin' red
They take off to the right but wind up goin' left instead
They busted through the fence and crashed the stillness of the night
They filled the air with dust and hair and vanished out of sight
Some say they died of thirst and time turned them into stone
Others say they withered and buzzards picked their bones
But somewhere on that prairie is a scene we all ain't saw
Did Tall get throwed or Badger rode or was it called a draw"
"I sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown
Everybody knows that I'm the newsboy of the town
You can hear me yellin' Morning Star runnin' along the street
Got no hat upon my head no shoes upon my feet

Never mind sir how I look don't look at me and frown
Sell the morning papers sir my name is Jimmy Brown

Wander bout from place to place my daily bread to win

"In black and white, unspoken words
Sitting by and as hard as stone
The terms of greed
one pact thats kept by thieves
Will live their part for the rest of our years
The change of address
Change of lent
Change of linen
To hide the shame
The change of mind,
Could change the way you feel
The painful truth
Is all to real
[Chorus]
What can I say
To change your heart
Oh tell me, in simple words
The rain of hope, to the light this storm
What can I say
To change you heart
I live my life
I live my alone
Cant help but think you'd come back home
But I cant forget a drink and then I cry
Said no forgiveness in your heart
She'll never try
[Chorus]
Well meeting friends
Don't understand what wont let go
We start again
I cant explain, the dream the spot that guides
One day we'll wake up, side by side
[Chorus]
What can I say
To change you heart"
"Sometimes a careless word just rolls right off my tongue
Now matter what I do it leaves you all undone
Hey baby no need to go crazy over some little something I've said
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart
Even when I lose my head
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
Sometimes the whisper of love gets lost in the angry shout
Even hearts that are in this deep might think about an easy way out
One honest touch makes those worries just fade like stars at dawn
These occasional moments of weakness
Only makes our love more strong
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
It gets easier all the time
Oh and harder and harder to leave behind
We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away
Baby don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin 'away"
"I knew you when you never drank the wine
But now you had to have it all the time
You don't even try to hide the things you do
Everything that's fastened down is comin' loose
Everything is tearin' at the scene breaking up our home and all my dreams
I once believe we'd make it so I put my trust in you
But everything that's fastened down is comin' loose

The home we built jst crumbling in your hands because I have devided just won't stand
You'd let the wine lead you to cheatin' to
So everything that's fastened down is comin' loose
Everything is tearin'..."
"Seen the bright lights of Memphis
And the Commodore Hotel
And it was there beneath the streetlamp
Where I met a southern belle
Well she took me to the river
Where she cast her spell
And it was 'neath that Memphis moonlight
She sang this song so well
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
We hit all the hot spots
My money flowed like wine
Till the lowdown southern whiskey
Began to fog my mind
Well I don't remember church bells
Or the money I put down
On the white picket fence and boardwalk
At the house on the edge of town
Now but boy do I remember
The strain of her refrain
And the nights we spent together
And the way she called my name
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
It's been a year since she ran away
Guess that guitar player sure could play
She always liked to sing along
He was always handy with a song
Then one night in the lobby
Of the Commodore Hotel
I by chance met a bartender
Who said he knew her well
And as he handed me a drink
He began to hum a song
And all the boys there at the bar
Began to sing along
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land
If you'll be my Dixie chicken
I'll be your Tennessee lamb
And we can walk together
Down in Dixie land
Down in Dixie land"
"I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me
I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be
I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me
So honey fool around, you know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome 'cause I'm used to that
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me"

It was a man's world for a day and a half
Adam had a garden for a bachelor pad
But something was missing in his paradise
Then along came eve, the apple of his eye
Without hesitation he gave into temptation
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side, put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing, cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same
Old christopher columbus would have never set sail
Without a little push from isabel
Alexander graham invented the phone
So his wife could ring a bell when she wanted his home
Some feminine persistence can make a world of difference
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side, put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing, cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same
It's all a part of the plan, for the good of every man
cause God created woman to raise a little cain
Gave her a softer side, put fire into her eyes to drive a man insane
He knew what he was doing, cause history has proven
Since God created woman man's never been the same"
"I always tried to tell her 'bout the rearview mirror
But she just wouldn't ever take a peek
She said there's no need lookin' where you've already been
When you've headed down a one-way street
There's n need thinkin' 'bout calling up he mother
Ain't no way she's ever comin' home
When it comes to finding trouble she won't have any trouble
'Cause she doesn't do no time alone
[Chorus]
She never looks back, just straight a head
When she says she's leavin' believe what she said
She never looks back that's a cold, hard fact
She never looks back
She never looks back
She must have been a pilot in a life before
'Cause she knows when it's time for her to bail
There's no point in chasing after her anymore
She says we're guaranteed to fail!"
"VERSE 1
I sit here surrounded by nothin but failure
My bottles empty but I still crave more
I hear what youre saying, not sure that Im listenin
Theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
Cause Im not the man that you married
And you cant turn water to wine
I want you to be happy so walk out the door
Theres no denying Im losing the war
VERSE 2
I wish that I had thought before I had spoken
My eyes are swollen my mouth is dry
I wish that I could tell you I could give it up for you
But theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
VERSE 3
Off in the distance, Im sure I see an angel
Her words are broken so are her wings
Eyes closed and dancing on top of the bar
Theres no denying Im losing the war
CHORUS
I want you to be happy so walk out the door
Theres no denying Im losing this war"
"Wake up, wake up, little Mary
Yes, there'll be a fine white cake, flowers for your hair
And you will see Aunt Julie Ann, no I won't be there
Throw the rice, dance and sing, have a real good time
If anybody asks, say I'm doing fine
Wake up, wake up, little Mary
There is no time to play
'Cause it's your mother's wedding day
Yes I'll always be your father, no your name won't change
And you will always have this room that will stay the same
Pretty soon it will be Christmas, we can buy a tree
And you can always call from Tennessee
Wake up, wake up, my little Mary
There is no time to play
'Cause it's your mother's wedding day
Your mother and me we were only twenty
On that beautiful spring morn
It was a fine day, a loving memory
But nothing like the day that you were born"
"Most of the time, things are pretty sublime in this little one horse town
Well they close all the stores and they roll up the steets
When the evenning sun goes down
But the fourth of July flags will be flying high
As folks come from miles around
They'll be roarin' all night till the dawns early light
When the big rodeo comes to town
Well there ain't no top names of rodeo fame no Tibbs nor Larry Mahans
Just some local cowboys out to make 'em some noise
But they know everyone in the stands
They're clean and they're wild with tobacco stained smiles
And they don't care if they make a dime
If they win or they lose well they don't give a hoot
They're out just to have a good time
There's cowboys and ladies and old folks and babies
And young girls with stars in their eyes
Flashy bronc riders and whisker'ed old timers tellin' their stores and lies
There's cold beer and Brandy and pink cotton candy
When it's all over they'll all head on down
To the rodeo dance some midnight romance
When the big rodeo comes to town
The bands playing loud to that dance hall crowd
As boots stir the dust on the floor
At the bar they're playin' old Willie and Whalen
As beers disappear by the score
But hangovers I'll bet they'll soon forget
When the next year comes rollin' around
They'll be at it again with all of their friends
When the big rodeo comes to town"
"Nights like this I wonder if I'm dreamin'
You dance as if your feet are off the ground
Almost like the world has stopped to watch us
Waiting for that moment you touch down
CHORUS:
So nights like this I stand a little taller
To prove that I am worthy of your kiss
I live for the spell you put me under
And the way I feel on nights like this
I know tomorrow I'll be leavin'
With the memory of tonight still in my mind
And it's a long and lonesome highway
That takes me from this love I leave behind
CHORUS
Girl, I never take for granted
The tender dying moments of our time
Memories are all that get me through
Until we never have to say goodbye
CHORUS
And the way I feel on nights like this"
"'Twas battered and scared and the auctioneer thought it hardly worth his while
To waste much time on the ol' violin but he held it up with a smile
""What am I offered good folks?"" he cried
""Who will start the bidding for me?
A dollar, one dollar, two, only two
Two dollars who will make it three
Three dollars once three dollars twice going for three
But, no from the back of the room a gray haired man came forward
And gently picked up the bow
And then wiping the dust from the ol' violin tuning the loose strings,
He played a melody as pure and sweet as the caroling angel's sing
The music stopped and the auctioneer with a voice quiet and low said
""Now what am I bid for the ol' violin?"" he held it up with the bow
A thousand dollars, who will make it two
Two thousand who will make it three
Three thousand once, Three thousand twice and going going and gone.
The people cheered, but some of them cried,
""We don't understand what changed its worth?""
Then someone replied, ""The touch of the master's hand.""
So many a man with life out of tune much like the ol' violin
But the Master comes and a change is brought
By the touch of the Master's Hand by the touch of the Master's Hand"
"I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know
Though I dreamed I would fall
Like a wounded cannonball
Sinking down with my heart in tow
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
There's a man all alone
Telling me his friends are gone
That they've died and flown away
So I told him he was wrong
That you friends are never gone
If you look to the sky and pray
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
Someone told me a lie
Someone looked me in the eye
And said time will ease your pain
But behold, when you fall
It's that same old cannonball
Coming back for your heart again
Bright lights like white lightning
Who shot me down
Who will cut me down
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
And it may come around
Until the day comes around
How I'm lost
How I'm found
I was born when I met you
Now I'm dying to forget you
And that is what I know"
"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
"Don't come around me with those sweet lies I don't wanna hear them anymore
I tried so hard to make a good girl out of you
It's all around now that's the way the wind blows
You want to hurt me one more time now why you do girl goodness knows
Again they'll return that a poor boy have to give
Now I'm movin' on that's the way the wind blows
That's the way the wind blows that's the way the love goes
One day it's warm the next it's cold
I'll find it hard little girl to say goodbye
But I'm on my way that's the way the wind blows
You made a fool of me too many times now I guess my love for you still shows
But this time I'm leaving you just wait and see
I'm a long time gone that's the way the wind blows
That's the way the wind blows."
"We walk, we fly, we stay sober, we get high
We sleep all day, stay up all night
Right a wrong, and live our lives
We work, we play, we leave, and we stay
We worry about tomorrow, today
We laugh, cry, cuss and pray
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
And it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
I've lived, I've learned that bridges don't just burn
Well that's the devil's selfish pride at work
Every chance he gets he'll take his turn
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
And it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
Tryin to matter to somebody
Tryin to get the time of day
Tryin to fit into this crazy world
Somehow, somewhere, someway
and it's all we're all lookin for
It's never too late ya know
To try and matter to the ones that matter most
It's never too late ya know
Tryin to matter to somebody"
"Well the train to Grinders

People down in Georgia come here and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

"It's all in your mind that I'm leaving you I've been afraid you'd found somebody new
If I lost you it would break this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind
You can't blame me for havin' my suspicions
When hearts are broken each and every day
Just listen to your heart and what it tells you don't listen to the lies that people say
It's all in your mind that I could let you go I tried to think you'd never hurt me so
For I know that I can't change this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind
You can't blame me..."
"Let the music
breathe upon my face
every step of the way
through the anguish I make
Like the rest I made
I'm seeing you as clear and blue
like lovers do
and you should too
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing
When life's confusing way to bring you down
has got you pissing yourself
while you're thinking out loud
Try and figure out
the best approach to being true
like lovers do
and you should, you should too
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing
You can't just give it all away
This is all we have saved
There is nothing here between us
This is not what we had planned
There is so much more
Got nothing without each other
We've got nothing
I'm not playing a game with you
to show that I can get ahead
Just like any weak man would do
when he's losing..."
"I've never had a face you'd notice
The world never took much notice of me
I've never been good at conversation
I was too busy tripping on my own feet
I've never had grand illusions
Love was always for someone else
But in a world so few surprises
There's still a few surprises left
Ain't it amazing that miracles happen?
Ain't it amazing, you can still find your dream?
Ain't it amazing, it all comes true
When someone like you can happen to someone like me?
So hold me now so warm beside you
Let me stay forever near
Sometimes I think I'm only dreaming
But I wake up, you're still here"
"Come here girl I got a bottle of wine
We can pass it around 'til we're feeling fine and crazy
Been a long day let your hair fall down
We can dance for a while
Lay around and be lazy
We love all night yeah baby
Sure feels good when ya take me
In your arms
Oh and then we start
We kiss like first time lovers
Tangled up in the covers
Lets get it on
Love me all night, make me miss ya all day long
Gimme a look with your bedroom eyes
Gonna lock it away up in my mind
For a daydream
Well come on girl, come off of that sugar
Take my hand baby now would ya lay me down
We love all night yeah baby
Sure feels good when ya take me in your arms
Oh and then we start
We kiss like first time lovers
Tangled up in the covers
Lets get it on
Love me all night, make me miss ya all day long
Tomorrow I'll be watching that clock
On the wall
'Til we pick back up
Right where we left off
Love all night yeah baby
Sure feels good when ya take me, in your arms
Oh and then we start
We kiss like first time lovers
Tangled up in the covers
Lets get it on
Love me all night make me miss ya all day long
All day long baby (all day long)
All day long (all day long)"
"THE LOVING KIND
WRITERS ROGER BOWLING, LARRY BUTLER
Somewhere I heard these words one time
Love is like a clinging vine
Wrap me 'round your heart
And 'round your mind
I've never had to cling to you
'Cause I have no fear of losin' you
Our love is not a clinging vine
It's the lovin' kind
Somewhere I let read these words one time
Love is like a glass of wine
Aging made it sweeter and so fine
It's no better now than before
'Cause we've got the best and there's nothin' more
Our love is not a glass of wine
It's the lovin' kind
Let them write their fancy words
For people who have never heard or tasted
A love like yours and mine
Ours is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kind
Our love is not a clinging vine
And its certainly not a glass of wine
It's love
And our love is the lovin' kind"
"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet, flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me, reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way, I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey, I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand"
"Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la, la la la la
While I tell of Yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Fast away the old year passes
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Hail the new year lads and lasses
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Sing we joyous, all together
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Heedless of the wind and weather
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Fa la la la la, la la la la"
"The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say good-bye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
'Let my guitar playing friend do my request.' (Let him...)
Sing me back home with a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die
I recall last Sunday morning a choir from 'cross the street
Came to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers 'There's a song my mama sang.
Can I hear once before we move along?'
Sing me back home, the song my mama sang
Make my old memories come alive
Take me away and turn back the years
Sing Me Back Home before I die"
"Don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you dear forever by my side
[ steel ]
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry with me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine"
"Written by billy burnette.
Just walk on out
And close the door
I don't wanna see you anymore
It was such a shock
Kind of cold conversation
To end such a long
Such a long relation
Plans we have made
Seem oh so beautiful
Now that we're apart
They wouldn't seem so suitable"
"Going through old dresser drawers
Fumbling through there closets
It's got to be here somewhere
I know it's round here somewhere
Searching from room to room
We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere
It's got to be here somewhere
Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown
We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost
Captured in old picture frames
Shinning in those faces
It used to be here somewhere
I know it's still here somewhere
Reflected in our children's eyes
How could we misplace it
I know it was here yesterday
How could it just slip away
it was more then just a box of junk
We stored away to gather dust
This was a dream we thought
We always could reach out and touch
We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost
We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that's it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost
Got to find the love that we lost"
"I was born in Saginaw Michigan I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And said I wasn't good enough for his daughter's hand
That's why I went up to Alaska searchin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I was diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'd strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history
So her dad met me in Saginaw Michigan
He gave me a great big party and we served champagne
Then he said son now you're a wise young ambitious man
Now won't you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim
So now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
Why the greedy fool is lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is a missin' him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan
Least of all us newly weds of Saginaw Michigan (Saginaw Michigan)"
"Well, won't you lend your lungs to me? Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing
Breath, I'll take and breath, I'll give and pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision
Fingers walk the darkness down, mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found, you fool, it's only moonlight
And if you try to take it home your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone, try to find another
Salvation sat and crossed herself and called The Devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf, who'll kill the raging cancer?
Seal the river at it's mouth, take the water prisoner
Fill the skies with screams and cries, bathe in fiery answers
Jesus was an only son and love his only concept
Strangers talk in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two ain't got time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world we tried
Keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world we tried"
"I've been weaving my way through your fabricated story;
tripping over into your territory as the rug was pulled out from under my feet.
You've collected a spool of the tales you are spinning and I've been all tangled up from the very beginning; silly me, I should've known better.
I watched you tie bows around what's true like you could box in lies with paper and glue.
Chorus:
Well, looks like you have run out of time;
this time you're way out of line and I'm all stuck in knots from trying to straighten you out.
And I've settled the score for you so I wouldn't have to believe what was true.
Spin your own web of lies -
Looks like you're all tied up.
You laughed, you cried, then you hung me up to dry, and it's hard to pick yourself up when you're stuck so high.
Yeah, sure, it's funny -- yeah, you've got me in stitches.
Well let's just see how low you can go - maybe at some point you'll learn that you'll reap what you sow when you let things spiral just to tie you over.
Well I'm ripping the threads out of all says you said; cutting every single tie that you ever tried to bind me to you.
Because I'm not your puppet -- this is my turn to shine and these strings are mine.
Chorus:
Well, looks like you have run out of time; this time you're way out of line and I'm all stuck in knots from trying to straighten you out.
And I've settled the score for you so I wouldn't have to believe what was true.
Spin your own web of lies -
Go lay under your patchwork quilt of lies; I promise you that they'll unravel with time -- don't wait for a sign.
Chorus:
Well, looks like you have run out of time; this time you're way out of line and I'm all stuck in knots from trying to straighten you out.
And I've settled the score for you so I wouldn't have to believe what was true.
Spin your own web of lies -
You can't tailor my life to fit your view.
Your tales(tails) are finally running loose from all of your frayed ends --
don't look now
your seam's unraveling."
"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign sayin ""will work for food""
You know the man
You see him every morning
The one you never give your money to
You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean
What if he's an angel sent here from heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel
There's a man
And there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's alot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony
You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
Come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye
What if she's an angel sent here from heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel
A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel
Most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes
Maybe she's an angel
Sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel"
"Come into my loving arms and forget it run into my loving arms you won't regret it
I will be your rock and keep you safe from harm
If you will stay with me within my loving arms
The sunshine of your life just call to say goodbye it hit you like a bow from the blue
Your big plans for the future have all gone up in smoke
Lost and lonely girl what will you do
Just come into my loving arms...
If you will stay with me within my loving arms"
"Oh, don't ya lose that light in your eyes
you're never too old to love, never too late to try
When somebody needs you
Give em all you can give
Oh, when you're livin to love and a lovin to live
[CHORUS:]
Stay young keep your wheels in motion
you've got everything that you need
Stay young with your rock n rollin
All the best things in life are free
Oh, don't ya feel like playin the fool
Just step outa line and break all the rules
Well, don't you let them tell you, Its not for you
Oh, don't go growin old, before you're due"
"I went on the search for something true.
I was almost there when I found you.
Sooner then my fate was wrote
Perfectly it slit my throat
And beads of lust released into the air.
When I awoke you were standing there.
I was on the mend when I fell through.
The sky around was anything but blue.
I found as I regained my feet
A wound across my memory
That no amount of stitches would repair.
But I awoke and you were standing there.
There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end.
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them.
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
I'm rested and I'm ready to begin.
I'm ready to begin.
I went on the search for something real.
Traded what I know for how I feel.
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
The light broke in and brought me to my feet."
"For thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city,
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,
He bought his wife the finer things,and sent his kids to collage,
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside,
But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going,
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind,
I watched his hair turn thin and gray, but his dream never faded,
He told me all about it at least a thousand times.
[Chorus]
He always wanted, a place out in the country,
Where the birds sing, in the morning,and the grass is emerald green,
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine,
And sit out in the evenin', where the air is, fresh and clean.
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses,
And more to get his son out of his run-ins with the law,
The more it took the more he gave, never once complaining,
I don't know how he ever stood the pressure of it all.
I never thought he'd make it, but he finally left the city,
And now he's got that special little place to call his own,
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him,
It wasn't hard to find because his name was on the stone.
[Chorus: x2]"
"FLOWERS FOR MAMA
WRITERS EDDIE NOACK, CINDY WALKER, AL RUMLEY
Papa brought flowers for mama today
And all the grown children, but it's not mother's day
I don't have no money, not even a dime
But I brought mama flowers like I have all the time.
Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils
I bring them to mama at the end of the day
And say flowers for mama, here's mama's bouquet.
They brighten her face and she holds me close
She'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
A smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hours.
Spoken:
Now mama was lying there, yes, they tell me she passed away
And she was surrounded by flowers that out-shined my bouquet
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile.
Sang:
Flowers for mama I picked them today
Not very much, just a simple bouquet
Mom wasn't so fancy but up there above
She's the prettiest flower in God's garden of love."
"I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna open my eyes
And see for the first time
I've let go of you
Like a child letting go of his kite
Oh, there it goes up in the sky
There it goes beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
Gonna look back in vain
And see you standing there
When all that remains
Is just the empty air
And now that you're gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
There it goes, up in the sky
There it goes, beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now
I'm gonna live my life
Like every day's the last
I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now"
"You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow
Show me a smile then,
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow
(When I last saw you laughing)
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow"
"Baby's good to me, you know,
She's happy as can be, you know,
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine, you know,
She tells me all the time, you know,
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That here baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know,
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine, you know,
She tells me all the time, you know,
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine"
"I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it, pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like us I poured it down the drain
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song
I know I've said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
You're on the feel good side of leaving
And I'm the backside of a mule
And I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my so sad come back song
And now I'm laying down without you
In this king size empty bed
And I wish I had my arms around you
But I'll just dream of you instead
'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my get back, come back
Hey, I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go and letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back, song
Oh yeah yeah
I know I said I wouldn't miss you
I said I wouldn't miss you girl, yeah
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
We all sang na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na, yeah
Come on now
So this is my my get bad, come back, song"
"STILL GOT YOUR PICTURE UP ON THE WALL
I CAN'T TAKE' EM DOWN
I KEEP EXPECTING YOU TO CALL
BUT YOU DON'T MAKE A SOUND
TIME AIN'T SUPPOSED TO PASS THIS SLOW
I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN YOU LONG AGO
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU
I'M TIRED OF PUTTING IT OFF TILL TOMORROW
SHOULD'VE DONE IT YESTERDAY
NO GAIN IN DROWNING IN MY SORROW
AND JUST WASTING AWAY
JUST WHEN I THINK I GOT IT MADE
YOU NEVER FAIL TO GET IN THE WAY
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU
BRIDGE:
IF I COULD JUST CONVINCE MYSELF
TO OPEN MY EYES AND SEE
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE FOR ME
THEN I COULD START ALL OVER
AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE
AND BE FREE FROM YOUR MEMORY
I COULD BE FREE
(YOU SEE) YOU'RE STILL HERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME
AND I CAN'T ERASE YOU FROM MY MIND
I JUST NEVER GET AROUND
NEVER GET AROUND, BABY
NEVER GET AROUND TO GETTING OVER YOU"
"When I was ten years old
I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were going on an eight-hour drive
If I could just watch TV
And I'd have given anything
To have my own Pac-Man game at home
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade
Now I've got it on my phone
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future
My grandpa was in World War 2
He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines
I wish they could see this now
The world they saved has changed you know
'Cause I was on a video chat this morning
With a company in Tokyo
Hey, everyday's a revolution
Welcome to the future
Hey, look around it's all so clear
Hey, wherever we were going, well we're here
Hey, so many things I never thought I'd see
Happening right in front of me
I had a friend in school
Running back on the football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today
And everybody who'd seen what he'd seen
From a woman on a bus
To a man with a dream
Hey, wake up Martin Luther
Welcome to the future
Hey, glory, glory, hallelujah
Welcome to the future"
"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?"
"Once I had myself a good woman
But I just didn't treat her right
I was always leaving
Livin' a party life
True love was waiting for me
I was much too blind to see
Till she told me she would leave me
I said that's all right with me
Oh now she's gone
Realize I lost the best thing there is
And my pride keeps telling me
Let your loss be your lesson
Heaven knows I miss her lovin'
Heaven knows how much I cry
Just to think she had left me
And I know the reason why
I could tell she had been cryin'
It didn't seem to bother me
Cause I know there's no one blinder
Than a fool who just couldn't see"
"A million roses sent to you one by one
Could never capture the way my feelings run
Could not express or symbolise
The love I find within your eyes
-------
CHORUS:
So don't you ever doubt
The meaning of my silence
The words may not come out
But you are the song of my heart
-------
My love's an ocean that words could never chart
A living ocean that's flowing from my heart
One you are sailing alone
The only love I've ever known
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:
No hearts and flowers my love in stone is formed
And in the fire of your gentleness I've warmed
Orphans' dreams lost and cold
And you turned them all to gold
-------
REPEAT CHORUS:"
"When I noticed her the first time I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she could come outside and play with me
Soon the days of sand and shovels gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changin' and I looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love without beginning or an end
Everyday I lived with her was like a new day dawning once again
And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips milk was circkled on her lips
After many years our love grew silent and at night I heard her cry
When she left me in the fall I said that it would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her everything she needed for a home
In searching for a pefect love I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life and is the mother of a little girl
Everytime I pass her house my thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man who wants to come inside out of the rain
And I've loved her since..."
"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies"
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her, 'baby'
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks down town with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?"
"The conversation seems to stop as soon as we walk in
And everybody calls to you and asks you where you've been
I fade into the background of an old familiar show
As I become a perfect stranger everywhere we go
Everywhere we go you seem to find some new old friend
And it's not long before I'm on the outside looking in
To other eyes I'm just a guy that no one seems to know
And I remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go
[ steel ]
I step aside for some old friend watch you while you dance
And I can see a million mem'ries in each stolen glance
They're all reminders from a past that I won't ever know
Cause I remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go
Everywhere we go you seem to find some new old friend
And it's not long before I'm on the outside looking in
I know that I could lose you if I let my feelings show
So I'll remain a perfect stranger everywhere we go"
"Rest (Andrea Lewis/Chris Jonat)
I've been around the world I've seen it and I've lived it friend
I've been around the world and now it's time for me to rest
I've been around the world I've seen it yes I've lived it
I've been around the world and now it's time for me to go
Do you believe that love is God, or do you feel the reverse
Do you believe a blessing is the absence of a curse
Do you believe you have no choice but let your life play out
Did you cut your own belief just to spite your doubt"
"Grandpa's down
By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes
From the back
Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line
While sipping on
Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us
My Dad's got
A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam
But he's still down
At the sawmill every day
Oh and first thing
'Fore the break of dawn
Mama's got his eggs
And coffee on
My whole life
It's been that way
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Just as sure as the river flows
We take care of our own
Step right up when someone needs a friend
Last year on the Johnson farm
A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build 'em back again, all right
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods"
"After the war was over I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight out on the ocean blue
The stars in heaven were shining the moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow and it made me think of our love
We'll build our home in the country and make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven sweetheart just for we two
[Steel]
Here we will live so happy and have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow because it reminds me of you
After this life is over and our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow and live in the stary blue"
"I know you're listening as I lay me down to sleep
It's not for me I ask, but my children's souls to keep
It seems the world is going crazy
And though I need to do my share
Could you please take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything
This is a mother's prayer
I know you're listening in the silence of this night
The news is blistering but I hold on to your light
And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith I know you're there
Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day to day
This is a father's prayer
I know I can't do this by my self
I thank you for your help
I know you're listening so I know I'm not alone
I feel you here with me as we all face the unknown
Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared
Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's prayer
This is a father's prayer
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's, a father's prayer"
"I shouldn't be missin? you
It makes no sense
Should be wearing, 'I'm over you' boots
And goin? dancin?
I'm having one of those
One of those days
God knows, I've had a few
But I know that it?s temporary
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
I think it?s over and done
Then I lose control
But when you've given your heart to someone
It?s inevitable
The first thing you never learn about love
Is that you never really let it go
I'm a walking contradiction
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
Breakdown, have a little breakdown
I lose sleep but hey
I can always catch up the next day
A few tears, everyone needs a good cry
Now and then, anyway, yeah
I've got a good life now
But every once in a while
I have a little breakdown
It ain't no big thing
I?ll be driving along
And hear a song we used to sing
And get lost, yeah, I have to stop
'Cause I get all caught up in the sound
I have a little breakdown
I shouldn't be missin? you
It makes no sense
Should be wearing I'm over you boots
And going dancin?"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
"Lets ride, down highway 49. Lets ride, down to the waterline.
Chorus: I can feel me coming alive, when you take me out for a ride. So lets ride.
Lets ride out of town into the night. Lets ride, aw baby everythings gonna be alright.
Chorus: I can feel you deep down inside. When you take me out for a ride."
"We've got a problem we can't get around
It's gotten too big to just tear down
We built a wall out of thin air
Now I'm over here and you're over there
I'm afraid that there's no two ways to it
This could be our undoing
Can't raise the ceiling, can't lower the floor
The only thing left is to build a door
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
That's all
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall
It might fall
You get a hammer and I'll get a saw
And we'll give this wall what-for
What we need between you and me
Is a door
We might get sweaty, might get dirty
A couple of splinters would be well worth it
We'll hang it right here, level and plumb
We'll shake hands on a job well done
Once that door's standing open
We'll get some communication going
We'll reach out and the next thing you know
This wall'll come down like Jericho
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
That's all
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall
It might fall
So you get a hammer and I'll get a saw
And we'll give this wall what-for
What we need between you and me
Is a door
A door ain't nothing but a way to get through a wall
That's all
A window won't work and a ladder stretched that tall
It might fall
You get a hammer and I'll get a saw
And we'll give this wall what-for
What we need between you and me
Is a door"
"Oh i imagine
I've broken a couple of hearts
Sure i've had moments
Sudden feelin' hit me too hard
I don't wanna be bitter anymore
Wanna let the sunshine in my door
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to keep me goin'
Cause it won't feel like home
Without something to hold me back
Without something to pull behind me
No it won't be the same
Without a reason to say goodbye
Without a reason to cry
I've clung to the anchor
When they tried to be my rescue
And i've taken the wrong turn on occasion
I could see the thing come crashin' down
There was nothin' left there anyhow
I don't wanna be too happy
Just enough to tide me over"
"Well I woke up this morning
To a telephone call
And that's when I noticed
Strange shoes in the hall
Well my head is reelin'
You say ""Hi, how you feelin'?""
But I don't recognize you at all
Chorus:
I was too drunk to remember
I was too blind to see
I had a helluva time
But it just slipped my mind
At least I got home in one piece
Well I look in the mirror
Filled with disgrace
Mascara runnin' all over my face
How can I endure
When it's all just a blur
Things that go bump in the night
Repeat Chorus
Recitation:
Well darlin', you know that I love you
If you're sure that's what I said
I mean it's so hard to recognize you
You just wearin' that bag on your head
Well my head is reelin'
You say ""Hi, how you feelin'?""
But I don't recognize you at all
Repeat Chorus
I said at least I got home with one piece"
"I've been called a rambler
'Cause I keep my eyes on that horizon line
And I've been called a gambler
'Cause I always wanna let my winnings ride
I've been broke more times than I can count
I've been stuck for days in a lonely town
When my luck ran south
[Chorus]
Hey, I might be makin' me a reputation
Of goin' my own way, and
I can't live it down
Got the throttle wide open gonna, live it up knowin'
In this life you only
Get one go around
And I can't live it down
There's times I've wasted money
'Cause I know that I can always make more cash
But wasted time is something, man
When it's gone, you can't get it back
So I'll go on burnin' up both ends
'Cause I don't want a whole lot of might've beens
Now that would be a sin
[Chorus]
Gonna live for a place I ain't been
Make a lot of good remember-whens
Right up to the end
[Chorus]
I can't live it down
I can't live it down"
"There where no cuckoos, no sycamores
We played about the forest floor
Underneath the silver maples, the balsams and the sky
We popped the heads off dandelions
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes
Rested on the riverbank
And grew up by and by, and grew up by and by
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little shady grove
Ring the bells of rhymney
Till they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow, rock the gallows
For the hangman's reel
And wake the devil from his dream
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
I'm going back to Harlan
And if you were Willie Moore
And I was Barbara Allen
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door
A weepin' and a-pinn', for love
A weepin' and a-pinn', for love"
"Jealous heart oh jealous heart stop beating can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything he planned for and I know he loved me from the start
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for since he heard your beating jealous heart
I was part of everything"
"Robert's appearance is something to behold
Dressed in the finest of store bought clothes
My mamma sews my clothes cause I'm just a poor girl
But Robert is as real as his daddies gold
Robert could have any girl that he wanted
But his feelings for me each day seems to grow
He don't know the reason, that he's so drawn to me
But there is a story that Robert doesn't know
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert is constantly making eyes at me
He misunderstands the feelings we share
There's no way that I can return his glances
But I know the meaning of the feeling that's there
Robert if you knew, there once was a rich boy
In love with a poor girl, long time ago
But the folks of that rich boy, would not let them marry
And I am a symbol of the love that they stole
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert, oh Robert if you only knew
The same blood is flowing in both me and you
That rich boy's your father, but he's also mine
And my mamma's the poor girl that he left behind
Oh Robert
Oh Robert"
"Now, people say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,
Deep down inside I'm blue.
[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you'll look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.
I need you, need you.
But since you left me if you see me with another guy,
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.
He might look good it's true
But he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.
[Chorus]
I need you, I need you.
Outside I'm masqueradin',
'Cause inside my hope is fading.
Like a clown since you put me down,
And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.
[Chorus: x2]"
"The Daylight Line written by Gene Clark There were too many people ridin' on the daylight line
I delivered to the club proceeded on a bottle of wine
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
I'd be home in the city but really that is not my pace
I could go down in pity or leave and take a look at my face
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
Sleepless nights without you
I don't want to live without you
But baby you know, oh whoa
We've got something between us
We better take it high or let it go, oh whoa I have sleepless nights without you
I don't want to live without you
But baby you know, oh whoa
We got something between us We better take it high or let it go, oh whoa
So there's too many people crowded on the daylight line
I delivered to the club proceeded on a bottle of wine
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold
Watching all the coastline roll, like anywhere it really could go
I never thought I'd strike a rhythm that would leave you cold"
"Not long ago I was thinking of home
And I wondered if Mama was there all alone
I thought I'd drop by as I'd done before
But the sound from within made me stop at the door
She was praying
A sound that the world seldom hears
Praying, her words were pleading and dear
The sound of her voice as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes, My heart filled with shame
Praying, praying for someone like me
I was walking one night and I felt so alone
My heart was so heavy from the trouble I'd known
I hadn't noticed a church that was near
Till the sound from within seemed to fill the air
They were praying
A sound that the world seldom hears
Praying, the children that God loves so dear
Outside in the darkness I could not see
But I could picture them down on their knees
Praying, praying for someone like me
Praying, praying for someone like me"
"Black girl black girl tell me where
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Now little girl little girl what have I done
That made you treat me so
You cause me to weep you cause me to moan
You cause me to leave my home
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
Saw the engine past at six o'clock
And the cab went bye and bye
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows"
"You've got your Texas way of walking
You've got your sexy way of talking
I let you get all under my skin
But now your welcome has worn awful thin
And so, now, it's time you go
Don't come back again
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You've got a girl in every cow town
You think I don't know how you cad around
I let your sweet talk in, my guard down
Took me a while to figure you out
But I've got you
Figured all out now
And your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just drop in
Drop out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
You'd best make up your mind
Cause if you go
You ain't coming back this time
Your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your quick-stop, lock up, open twenty-four
You can't just drop in, drop out
Treat me like your candy store
Cause your train don't stop here any more
I ain't your gas-up, rest-stop swinging door
You can't just walk in
Walk out like so many times before
I ain't your swinging door
I ain't your swinging door"
"Amen (Chris Jonat)
Well I'm Jonathan Charles Henry McKay
I've lived on this farm 30 years and a day
Some folks call me Junior but I don't like it that way
Since the storm of '90 when dad left to stay
Mom passed a year later couldn't bear being alone
It's going on ten years I been head of this home
Now I got me a wife and three boys of my own
I work hard, I live clean, I reap what I've sewn
Aint had rain to speak of in round near a year
Crops searching for water but there aint nothing near
We need something soon, but it won't come I fear
My children won't eat, wife'll run out of tears.
So I went to the back forty, said I needed the air
I walked past the fence, through the Johnson share
And when I made right sure no one followed me there
I got down on my knees, cried Lord, do you care?
Amen, Amen, Oh Lord, Amen, Amen
Next morning came early sleep still in my eyes
My eldest, John Three, he was the first to rise
He said, Daddy come quick I got the biggest surprise
We jumped to our clothes cause we realized
Could hear the rain pounding the patio door
And sneaking through cracks onto the kitchen floor
We danced in the yard til we could stand it no more
Then got down on our knees gave our thanks to the Lord
I sent the boys to their aunts, day before last
Yesterday morning told the wife get there fast
The water keeps rising it's already past
The roof of the house but I'm staying pat
Now I'm top of the tree where my daddy once climbed
And I'm thinking I'm done though it don't seem my time
I got living to do, business to mind
Wanna watch the boys grow, see the next in my line
And I can't bow down, cause there's no land for my knees
But I'm crying out loud now, I'm asking you please
Father have mercy, Jesus hear my pleas
Lord up in heaven I'm not ready to leave
Well I'm Jonathan Charles Henry McKay
And I've lived on this farm my ten years and a day
Some folks call me Three but I don't like it that way
Since daddy done traded his own life for rain"
"We moved from where we lived so we could start again
When you told me you'd forgive me if I'd change
But it really doesn't matter what town we're in
Cause I answer when temptation calls my name
There's a devil inside me that pushes and guides me away from you
And your love cannot hold me when patience control me I can't be true
The far off devotion is drowned by emotions I can't understand
And not even your sweet love can change the kind of man I am
I fight the guilt and shame that's deep in my mind
I can't put out the fire of desire that burns in my soul
I try to hide the evil inside but that's when I find
That there's a part of me I can't control
There's a devil inside me...
And not even your sweet love can change the kind of man I am"
"The streets're dark and empty and you walk them all alone
You think about your love affair and wonder what went wrong
You go to bed each night and pray you'll never see the dawn
Afraid of each tomorrow with its heartless cold unknown
And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know cause I'm a mighty lonesome guy
You search to find a tavern where the music is playing loud
You try to lose your heartaches in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops till you're by yourself again
And that's what it's like..."
"Too country what's that
Is it like too Republican or too Democrat
Is it too far to the left
Too far to the right
Too straight down the middle
Is it too black or too white
Are the biscuits too fluffy is the chicken too fried
Is the gravy too thick are the peas too black-eyed
Is the iced tea too sweet does it have too much tang
Are there too many lemons in mama's lemon meringue
Too country what's that
It is too many pearls of wisdom under grandpa's old hat
Is it just too old fashioned is it just too antique
Is the question too strong or the answer too weak
Are the roses too red is the sunshine too bright
Are there too many stars in the heavens at night
Are there too many fish that still jump in the stream
Is the blue sky too blue is the clean air too clean"
"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it be--me"
"There's no more waiting
Holding out for love
You are my Godsend
That I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you
What is this feeling
I've never known before
That I should touch you
Swearing to surrender ever more
That's what I came here for
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways
Heaven knows
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost
Heaven knows
I'm head over heels and it shows
I've played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around
Baby I have found
I get lost in you"
"I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining around my door
Oh, how I wish I was there again down in the little green valley
For then my homesick heart will trouble me no more
There's only one thing ever brings me consolation
And that's the dream that I'll be going back someday
And every night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away
I see a candlelight down in the little green valley
Where Morning Glory vines are twining around my door
Oh, how I wish I was there again down in the little green valley
For then my homesick heart will trouble me no more
There's only one thing ever brings me consolation
And that's the dream that I'll be going back someday
And every night down upon my knees
I pray the Lord to please take me
Back to that little old green valley far away"
"Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
I've waited all through the years love to give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow in your loveless mansion on the hill
The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill"
"(Hey good lookin' hey good lookin')
Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
Hey hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over young hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me
So hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me
I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me
I'm gonna throw my datebook over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
So hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me"
"The old man told his story
About the years gone by
How he played his horn down in New Orleans
In some old dingy dive
""I knew 'em all back then."" he said
As he reached out for his horn
He closed his eyes - and wet his lips
Then the blues were born.
He played with so much feelin'
Tears came from his eyes
He stopped and reminisced a bit
And then he gave a sigh!
Said, ""You know, I almost made it
But that was before your time
Dixieland, Po' Folks Blues
ScatMan Jack and wine.""
Slapped his knee and gave a grin
It sure was good back then
Reaching for his horn on the floor
Placed it in an old towsack
That hung across his back
He said ""Goodbye!""
And shuffled out the door.
Enthused by what he told me
I never got his name
So, I called the waitress over
And started to explain
A tired old man - his tarnished horn
Mem'ries of years gone by
How he played his horn and reminisced
Smiled with tear-dimmed eyes.
She said you are mistaken
There's been no one but you
But I know who you're talkin' 'bout
I used to know him, too
You'll find him down on Basin Street
In back of an old churchyard
A stone that reads, ""Rest in Peace
I tried but it sure was hard.""
CHORUS
He said, ""Goodbye"" then shuffled out the door."
"I think I'll go across the ocean
If I don't change my notion
I just got to forget you if I can
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Every day is sad and lonely
For I'm thinking of you only
Oh I just can't sleep when I lay down
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Oh the nights are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can't bear the thought of losing you
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
Oh I like to be forgiven
But this life ain't worth living
If I have to sit and worry over you
Oh I'm feeling so blue
I don't know what to do
For I'm head over heels in love with you
For I'm head over heels in love with you"
"Well I've been out here diggin' a hole,
And the madder I get the deeper I go,
Maybe you're thinkin' I'm a fool,
Well maybe I'm diggin' this hole for you,
I've got bones to pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you should know that when you get home,
I got bones to pick with you
Shoveling dirt and loadin' lead,
Whiskey burnin' up my head,
You can tell your friend I know the news,
And I'll deal with him when I'm done with you
I've got bones to pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you should know that when you get home,
That I got bones to pick with you!
Yeah maybe you best just leave this town,
Yeah probably before the sun goes down,
'Cause the Devil already knows my name,
And you can ask him yourself when I see you again!
Bones, to pick with you,
I should have known,
You cant be true,
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you just know when you get home,
I've got bones, I've got bones,
To pick with you,
I should have known,
You can't be true
Me and the devil,
We want what's due,
And you just know when you get home,
I've got bones to pick with you!
Well I've been out here diggin' a hole,
I'm gonna push you in nice and slow,
Well maybe you're thinkin' I'm your fool,
Well maybe I'm diggin' this hole for you!"
"(Dolly Parton)
Your love is like a gentle breeze
That's always blowin' over me
I know you're all I'll ever need
In each and every way
You're both ends of the rainbow
My colors and my pot of gold
I love you with a love untold
More than I can say
You are the song of every bird
You are the poet's every word
Every artist's picture
Every writer's play
You are the glow in every night
You are the warmth in each sunrise
Makes no difference how I try
It's more than I can say
And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away
And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fullfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
Oh and sometimes I watch you gently sleep
Listen as you softly breathe
Touch you skin and kiss you sweet
And love you all the way
I reach for you
You come to me
Love me into ecstacy
I will love you endlessly
More than I can say
And when I've needed you
You've always been there for me
Been my friend and stood by me
And held me as you loved the world away
And when I've wanted you
You have satisfied my needs
Fullfilled all my fantasies
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
I love you more and more each day
More than I can say
More than I can say
More than I can say
More than I can say"
"I've got your picture
That you gave to me
And it's signed with love
Just like it used to be
The only thing different
The only thing new
I've got your picture
She's got you
I've got the records
That we used to share
And they still sound the same
As when you were here
The only thing different
The only thing new
I've got the records
She's got you
[Chorus]
I've got your memory
Or, has it got me
I really don't know
But I know, it won't let me be
I've got your class ring
That proves you cared
And it still looks the same
As when you gave it, dear
The only thing different
The only thing new
I've got these little things
She's got you
[Chorus]
I've got your class ring
That proves you cared
And it still looks the same
As when you gave it, dear
The only thing different
The only thing new
I've got these little things
She's got you"
"I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see;
I won't be much when you get through' with me
Well, I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb;
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now, the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see;
I won't be much when you get through' with me
Well,I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, ev'ry night you drag me where the bright lights are found;
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale;
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail"
"If only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without you
So long without you
Walking down the street
In a seconds' beat
I can shift from emptiness
To bursting at the seams
Someone passes by
Sad, familiar eyes
And I'm spilling on your answering machine
Wish we were closer
Need to be closer
If only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without you
So long without you
What if you were here?
Would it change a thing?
We might drift for hours through familiar wanderings
Then needing time along
Time to know our own
Caught up in this puzzlebox
The paradox of need
Need to be closer
Need to be closer
If only love
Can mend my heart
Why do I ache when we're apart?
And if only love
Can make me strong
Tell me how I'm to get along?
So long without you"
"I know you've had a change of heart the way you're on the range
But the love for you that's in my heart is something you can't change
When you get your field of green, green grass
Stay home and you'll find clover
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's both admit that we've been wrong, cry on each other's shoulder
Let's straighten up and save our love before we lose each other
Let's stop right where we are and start all over
You don't love on me anymore the way you used to do
So I went out looking for the love I failed to get from you
I'd make believe that it was you the nights when I would hold her"
"O holy night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices o night divine o night when Christ was born
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming with glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
Led by the light of the stars so brightly gleaming
Here came the wise men from Orient land
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and cloudless morn
Fall on your knees oh hear the angel voices
O night divine o night when Christ was born o night divine o night o night divine"
"I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you
Well I left my Gracie and I cought a big train searching for wealth and fame
But every clickety-clack of the railroad track seemed to bring out my Gracie's name
Well ain't it amazing Gracie how much that I love you
I've been all over the world but no other girl ever thrilled me the way that you do
Ain't it amazing how I love you
Well she's not the prettiest girl in the world I know she's not the smartest one too
But she's always there and I know she cares and I know her little heart is true
Well ain't it amazing Gracie...
I met a lot of pretty girls wherever I'd go none could ever take her place
`Cause everytime I'd look into their eyes I keep a seein' my Gracie's face
Well ain't it amazing Gracie..."
"There's a plane flyin' outta here tonight:
Destination, New Orleans.
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line:
He says that's right where I need to be.
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home.
All this leavin' her alone is killin' me.
And holdin' her, right now, has got me thinkin' more an' more,
This is right where I need to be.
Where when I hear her I can see her,
I can smell her sweet perfume.
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep.
Where I won't miss her, I can kiss her anytime that I want to.
Yeah, that's right where I need to be.
Yeah, that's right where I need to be.
Wow.
There's a plane flyin' outta here tonight,
With an empty first-class seat.
'Cause I've finally got all my priorities in line,
And I'm right where I need to be."
"She was my friend when I needed a friend
He was a man who said our love would never end
When things went wrong she'd tell us both to try again
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for
And there were times when she was feeling down
One of us would always come around
And try to share some other happiness we found
That's what friends are for that's what friends are for
I suppose I should have seen what was happening to me
And I guess I should have known there wasn't love enough for three
And now there's only me
So I'm alone like I never thought I'd be
I trusted her just as far as I could see
And she stole his love away from me
If that's what friends are for
I don't need them anymore"
"Many shoes have taken steps across the treshold
But no shoes were ever crowder than his
On the day he carried me across the treshold
And gave his brand new bride a wedding kiss
Now a hundred heartaches later out the treshold
All his love for me has vanished there's no doubt
And the lips that kissed me coming through the treshold
And they're laughin' now as I go walking out
[ steel ]
I built my little world behind that treshold I may not have made him happy but I tried
Still his eyes keep looking out across the treshold
For the happiness he thinks he left outside
Now I'm standing all alone at the treshold
All his love for me has vanished there's no doubt
And the lips that kissed me coming through the treshold
And they're laughin' now as I go walking out
I hear him laughin' now as I go walking out"
"I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse wheel rolling
It was taking my sister away
Said, undertaker, undertaker
Won't you please drive real slow?
That's my little baby sister
Not a soul came to see her go
Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky lord, in the sky
I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse wheel rolling
It was taking my mother away
Undertaker, undertaker
Won't you please drive real slow?
That's my mother, my dear old mother
I sure hate to see her go
Circle be unbroken
By and by, lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky lord, in the sky
Years have passed now
By the same old window
On the cold and cloudy day
When I see the hearse wheels rolling
They was taking Chief Jolly away
Undertaker, undertaker
Won't you please drive real slow?
That's Chief Jolly that you're carryin'
I sure hate to see him go"
"You hold his hand and his lies
Plan a day while he cries
What else can you do?
He means something to you
What will you do when he dies?
Girl, he's killing himself
In a car when you're not driving
In a bar when you're not looking
With food that you're not cooking
And every minute you're not in it
What will you do when he dies?
You tuck the sheets on his bed
And you won't eat till he's fed
What more can you do?
When he's gone you are true
What will you do when he's dead?
Know he's surely going
In a bet that you're not taking
In a plane you're not flying
It's drugs that you're not buying
And every minute you're not in it
What will you do when he dies?
Girl, he's killing himself
In a plane you're not flying
Pills that you're not taking
And a bed that you're not making
And every minute you're not in it
What will you do when he dies?"
"Always darling in all ways I belong to you and just to you alone
Always for all of my days I will love you till the breath in my body is gone

"The sun is hot and that ol' clock is movin' slow and so am I
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime but it's July
Gettin' paid by the hour, older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin' but think I'll just call it a day
And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be here to pay, hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation is gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I've just sailed away
And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
I could pay off my tip
Pour myself in a cab and be back to work before 2
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
I say, pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
He don't care and I don't care, it's five o'clock somewhere"
"If I had my life to live over I'd do the same things again
I'd still want to roam to the place we call home
Where my happiness never would end
I'd meet you when school days were onward
And walk through the lanes that we'd knew
If I had my life to live over I'd still fall in love with you
I'd meet you when school days"
"Almost heaven, West Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River.
Life is old there,
Older than the trees,
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze.
[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain mom,
Take me home, country roads.
All my memories gathered 'round her,
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.
[Chorus]
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me,
Radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
[Chorus]"
"Mornin' comes, she wakes up fore it's light
And starts another day in hell
Tryin' to get her makeup right cause this time she can't tell 'em that she fell
He's sleepin' off another one so she tiptoes around
She don't make a sound
I don't know how she does it
One handed her a coffee cup
One to get the babies in the car
Cross your fingers, crank it up, hope and pray the piece of shit'll start
Singing with the radio so she don't fall apart
It's just a broken heart
I don't know how she does it
Finally into town the old familiar red light shining in her eyes
Rolls the window down and whispers, how you're gonna take back your life
She usually makes a right to work but turns it to the left
I think she might head west"
"When God dips his pen of love into my heart
And writes my soul a message he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine when God dips his love in my heart
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well it makes me laugh it makes me cry it sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips his love in my heart
Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to God in prayer I can always find him there to whisper sweet peace to my soul
Well I said I wouldn't tell it
(When God dips his love in my heart)"
[instrumental]
"I stood on faith and the corner of ambition
I came here to sink or swim
And to show them all that they were wrong
And though I never thought I'd make it this far
So the curtains are down
For the moment I'm someone
There were those in the wings who waited,
Who came this way
Now there gone
But there's always someone at home
Who never forgets who you are
When I'm down and I'm growing old
I won't be along no railroad track
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps
Between these cracks on Broadway
And my stride in rhythm to
The beat of home, sweet home
When I'm down and I'm growing old
I won't be along no railroad track
I won't be bound to a life out in the cold
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps
Between these cracks on Broadway
And my stride in rhythm to
The beat of home, sweet home
Can't go on,
I'm on the top of my better years
I'm going home,
It's too lonesome on the bottom rung here
It's been a steady pace to keep my steps
Between these cracks on Broadway
And my stride in rhythm to
The beat of home, sweet home"
"I've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.
Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight
Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.
I need you so now
Come on let go now
Kick off your shoes
Turn out the light
And love me tonight"
"I have a safe and sure retreat where I'm alone with God
A perfect peace and happiness where sorrow never trod
Oh praise his name his holy name salvation full and free
Ol' glory to the blessed lamb my Saviour leads the way
My Saviour leads the way my Saviour leads the way
My soul was lost in deep despair till Jesus came to me
But now I'm safe thank God I'm safe because of calvary
I'm following his footsteps my Saviour leads the way
[ steel ]
My burdens all seem lighter when I steal away and pray
I feel his presence and I know he's with me all the way
Alone with him I'll watch and wait I know it won't be long
Till I shall stand before my Lord and sing a happy song
My Saviour leads the way..."
"After all these years runnin' round
Flyin' high and fallin' down
Well, the time has come at last
To rest my heart and ease my past
I'm gonna leave these blues behind
For some other fool to find
He won't care and I don't mind
Hide me babe, hide me babe
Darlin', don't you cry tonight
The moon is full and the world is right
I've loved more than my share
Took the pain and called it fair
So I'm gonna lay down all my fears
My highway blues and my ramblin' tears
They can shout it down the line
I can't take what was not mine
I'll raise my glass and I'll make a toast
Better than some, harder than most
Left our mark on every town
Chased our dreams and we stood our ground
But I can't do those things no more
Hide the way I've done before
The same wings that brought me through
Blow that fate and flame out too
After all these years runnin' round
Flyin' high and fallin' down
Well, the time has come at last
To rest my heart and ease my past
I'm gonna leave these blues behind
For some other fool to find
He won't care and I don't mind
Hide me babe, hide me babe"
"Baby, all these city lights
Are losing their shine
I need a little bit a get outta here
A little slow unwind
A little salt air and a sand bar
A lawn chair and a guitar
Singing sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
All night long
All night
Chorus:
I wanna get high
On some low country
Where the sun meets the water
And the nights get hotter
Sounds right on the money
Let's let that tide take us for a ride
Girl, wherever it wants to
I wanna get high
On some low country with you
Down there where the warm wind blows
Through the cypress trees
You take your worries like the pennies in your pocket
And you, you throw 'em in the sea
Get a sweet buzz from your long kiss
Better than any rum hitting my lips
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-la
All night long
All night
Repeat Chorus
Ain't it funny how life can be crazy
Come on, let's get gone
'Cause the days are getting long and the nights are getting hazy
Come on, let's hold on
Repeat Chorus
Low country with you, oh, yeah
Low country with you
My low country with you"

"Love you so much it hurts need you so much it hurts
Want you so much and that's for certain
And if you do me wrong I'll still tag along cause I love you so much it hurts
Everybody tells me what a flirt you are and that not for certain if that's all you are
But only you and I know what we're reaching for
And darling I'm just reaching out to love you
Love you so much
Rumors of flying yes they're everywhere
And there's none easy feeling I feel in the air
But I've heard it said what you don't know won't hurt you so
Well I don't wanna know because I love you so
Love you so much..."
"Hey girl, hey girl, you warned me to go
But girl, but girl, little did I know
All the things you told me about what lay in store
Would only make me want you more
No not a word had one chance to save me
From your love that wicked love
There's not a prayer left for me escaping
From your love yeah, that wicked love
Hey girl, hey girl, I begged and hollered please
But girl, but girl, even from my knees
All the things you told me about what lay in store
Only made me want you more
No pain can stop or rid me what I'm needing
From your love that wicked love
'Cause what I crave all night and end each day still seeking
Is your love, yeah, that wicked love
Hey girl, hey girl, I tried to understand
But girl, but girl, there ain't no way I can
'Cause all the things you told me about what lay in store
Only made me want you more
Yeah, all the things you told me about what lay in store
Yeah, they only make me want you more"
"Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling that it won't be long before it's crying time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And tears are only rain to make love grow
For my love for you could never grow no stronger if I live to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again...
[ piano + steel ]
Now you say that you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again..."
"My windshields cracked just like my heart
My tires are all flat just like my brain
My engine?s running rough, just like my soul
Don't know how much further we can go burning this much oil
So let's burn all the bridges, ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down, listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But it?s one step closer to you, being gone
I gave you the tools but you broke every single rule
Every time I turn around, I'm running back straight to you
Well, I'm broken and twisted, tired of dancing around
Pick me up, throw me down, pull me in, throw me out again
So let's burn all the bridges, ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down, listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But it?s one step closer to you, being gone
Tell me which way to go
'Cause if I'm going down
I want to be the first to know
So let's burn all the bridges, ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down, listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
Yeah, let's burn all the bridges, ignore all the signs
Put the hammer down, listen to her whine
I don't know where we went wrong
But it?s one step closer to you, oh, it?s one step closer to you
Oh, it?s one step closer to you, being gone
Bye, bye, bye, bye, my baby
Bye, bye"
"Back in the country a few years ago there was sure a lot about the girls I don't know
I wondered how to steal a kiss but I was so shy
I wondered a million times every time I'd try
What am I gonna do now well I don't know how
Girls started asking whatcha gonna do now
Well I was a gettin' sweet on the neighbor's daughter Lou
She was cute and sassy and kinda bold too
She told me she'd show me what it's all about
She was gonna teach me how to knock 'em out
Well holding hands and making eyes I learned in lesson one
Lou was my teacher and school sure was fun
How to put my arms around came in lesson two
She said now you're ready to learn somethin' new
Whatcha gonna do now you gotta show me how
Oh don't keep me waiting whatcha gonna do now
[ guitar ]
I took her to the cake walk at the country school
She was hangin' on to me and she wouldn't turn me loose
Girls started making eyes I guess it made Lou sore
She took me to the moonlight said I gotta teach you more
Kisses by the dozens hugs to beat the ban
I yelled and I pleaded huh just one little man
Lou was sure excited and me I tell you more
And then I saw a gleam that I ain't never saw before
Whatcha gonna do now oh how you do know how whatcha gonna do now"
"This big old car, gonna take us home
This big old car, gonna take us home
Gonna take us home to what we know so well
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us all the way to Brisbane
All the way to Cairns
Back across to Katherine
To the Fitzroy River sands
Gonna see the Indian Ocean
And we'll turn around and then
This big old car's gonna take us home again
Ain't got no rattle free transmission
Ain't no good around the town
There's no fitted air conditioning
We just roll the windows down
And throw another tape in
And turn it up and pray
This big old car gonna take us all the way
This big old car gonna take us home
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us home to what we know so well
This big old car gonna take us home
This big old car gonna take us home
Gonna take us all the way and back
However far we roam
Take us all the way to
Chroma plated big V8'd heaven
This big old car's gonna take us home again"
"Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feelgood pills and a red Gatorade by my bed
Ready to go
I'm gonna do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab, climb in a cab
Hit another spot downtown
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wild-ass buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends
Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Ha ha yeah, slide
It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight
Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on, it's all about tonight
We're gonna get our swerve on, our buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby, I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight, now, c'mon"
"Through that green field, through yellow flowers
Over that hill, lies a heavenly lake
Her beauty inspires me, it makes me feel calm
Much like being wrapped up, baby in your arms
But everybody knows, that happy ever after
Has valleys of darkness, has snow capped mountains
Everybody knows, there are beaches on shores
That somehow disappear in the eye of the storm
You asked me a question, I gave you an answer
You're all I want and more
And if happy ever after, means fighting some battles
Baby you're worth fighting for
I believe in love songs, and I believe in pain
I believe in sunsets, I believe on rainy days
I believe in your presence, that I am a better man
Then I'd ever be, without you here
But everybody knows, that happy ever after
Has valleys of darkness, has snow capped mountains
Everybody knows, there are beaches on shores
That somehow disappear in the eye of the storm
You asked me a question, I gave you an answer
You're all I want and more
And if happy ever after, means fighting some battles
Baby you're worth fighting for"
"I've been sitting here alone all night
Thinking 'bout things that I'm gonna write
When you read this goodbye note you'll know I've had enough
But it should come at no surprise to you
Knowing you treat me the way you do
You've made lovin' too hard and living too rough
I just need a good place to start
To say what I really feel in my heart
And what I'm gonna write to you is long overdue
And don't expect me to change my mind
Or try to read something between the lines
Make no mistake about it baby, we're through
But every word I write comes out I love you
I just want to say it's over no matter how I try
Every word I write comes out I love you
Guess I've loved you much too long to say goodbye"
"Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes
And daddy once was able to hold his head up high
But now I brought disgrace to my whole family
Now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on
So in my hurt and bitterness
I let myself go alone
But all I did was hurt myself
And shame my family
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
No I'm not worth
The salt in one tiny tear
Oh why have I brought shame
To the one I loved so dear
I'm so sorry that I hurt them
But they'll never know how sorry
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me"
"I came from a town that was so small you look both ways and you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out every evening I'd slip into town
And stand around by the caution light and watch the big trucks rolling by
For me it was a beautiful sight big wheels in the moonlight
I had a case of wanderlust I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on highway fifty-nine I could hear some big old diesel whine
She was going through all the gears headed out to who knows where
I fell asleep most every night dreaming about big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
How I got here it's hard to say so many things got in my way
Can't complain about all I've got kids and a wife and a regular job
But at night when I'm setting here all alone in a living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes and see big wheels in the moonlight
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
And I want to put my life on the centerline
And I want to see the world before I die
And I know that there's a peace I'll never find
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind
'Cause those big old wheels keep rolling through my mind"
"He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday he set out on his own
He was 30 years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies"
"Kiss away kiss away guess that's all that's left to say
Please come back and kiss these tears away
Smile again let me smile again make this life worthwhile again
Please come back and kiss these tears away
Only you can change these sad and blue days
Only you can make them I-love-you days
So kiss away kiss away still there's nothing left to say
Please come back and kiss these tears away
Only you can change"
"She had trailer park charm, he carved her name in his arm
Then he slept with the waitress from the bar
Then she took a chain to his car
And broke the windows on the love they had, redneck love gone bad
He got all liquored up, tried to hot wire her truck
Next thing he knew, he was seeing stars
While her daddy knocked him all around the yard
Oh, what a night they had, redneck love gone bad
'Round and around the blue lights go
Everybody's smoking and watching the show but it's over now
There's twenty-three versions of this story
Some say her love just drove that boy insane
But to me it's plain, redneck love gone bad, oh, pick him redneck
He's going with her mother now
Every Friday night we see them cruise through town
A few months back, she ran away, with a truck driver named Jose
She's happy and he's so glad, redneck love gone bad"
"No day passes by no night without cry my whole world is hurt from now on
Each minute reveals heartbreak so real my whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain misery
I'm more confused and emptiness right here inside of me
And no future's bright out go those lights
My whole world is hurt from now on
And if I try to forget a just plain misery"
"Nibblin' on sponge cake
Watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strummin' my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp hey they're beginnin' to boil
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know it's nobody's fault
I don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think
Must be Buffet's fault
I blew out my flip-flop
Stepped on a pop-top
Broke my leg twice I had to limp on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
Hang on
Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know this is all Alan's fault
Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know it's our own damn fault"

Do you want me for the weekend, or just for the day?
Cause I know that youre here, but I know you wont

I know I may not be funny, and I dont have that charm;

But I guess youre free,

"Well, Ill never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I cant even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldnt even act like I was mad
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
Thats like just last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was going off
She was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see, me laugh
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
I know shes not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isnt 'cause, how boring would that be?
Its the little imperfections, its the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and were lost but holding hands
Yeah, I live for little moments like that
When shes laying on my shoulder, on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep, so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it 'cause it's tingling and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I dont wanna wake her up
Yeah, I live for little moments
When she steals my heart again and doesnt even know it
Yeah, I live for little moments like that"
"In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday soon we'll meet up yonder
And we'll walk hand in hand again
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain"
"Don't make me a promise and then make me blue
Don't say you love me if that isn't true
Don't make me cry so much I can't see please don't take advantage of me
You might be the kind who'll just lead me on
Then when I need you most that's when you'll be gone
Don't tell me those sweet lies you know I'll believe please don't take advantage of me
Ever since I first met you I've been so in love
Day and night it's you that I'm thinking of
So before you hurt me I'm begging you please please don't take advantage of me
You might be the kind"
"Hey little girl you might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to
Hey little girl
Maybe some day
Least that's what all the good people will say
Hey little girl, look what you've done
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You've stole my heart and made it your own
Hey little girl, black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes
And tell you such big lies
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear
My little girl
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You've stole my heart and made it your own"
"Cheap perfume and painted faces
Fallen angles fill the places
Where I go when my troubles pull me down
And all the lies I know they'll tell me
And the time that they will sell me
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town
Back at home in bed she's crying
For her love for me is dying
But she'll pray I'll make it safely through the night
When the morning sun starts showing
To her bedside I'll be going
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light
And I'll make promises, promises to change
I'll make her promises and swear I'll rearrange
And I'll start giving all the love she needs
If only she will stay
Once again she'll reasure me
And I believe her love will cure me
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face
Lord, I know she's just a woman
And her love can't last forever
And someday soon I know
She'll leave without a trace"
"She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doin' what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwin' words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doin' what she likes
Doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' them burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
Yeah, I like doin' what she likes
Hmm, yeah"
"What to do and where to start?
Things are falling all apart
Trying hard to move ahead
But keep losing ground instead
Still I have to take a chance
Putting fear and doubt aside
Had no warning in advance
Nothing left to do but try
[Chorus:]
And I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
But I have to get a grip
And hold on to it like a vice
Have to face the falling chips
I just might make it, I just might
Oh, I might have been a fool
But its true that love is blind
And you have broken every rule
You've taken all that yours and mine
And How does one go on with life?
When your shattered so inside
Pieces of a love gone wrong
Well, ya pick'em up and you move along
[Chorus:]
But I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
I just might live to see the day
I can say ""hey I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright""
I better go on either way
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know
Well, I might even be surprised
I've got to get on with my life
I just might make it
I just might
Nothin left to do but try
I might make it
I just might"

Ahhhh...uh
Oh (coughs)
AHHHCHOOOOOO
Ah my head feels as big as a dad blang basketball
It's a shame I'm a sight
Red eyes itchy both day and night
My head's all stuffed up tight again
Oh no spring's back
Another dang allergy attack
I bought some Sudafed
And took the whole dern pack
And I still can't breathe and I cough and I hack
I want to live where the grass don't grow
I'm sick and tired of blowin my nose
Never again will you hear me go ACHOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So much congestion in my chest
Doctor's said that it might be best
For me to move where the pollen count is low
Where the grass don't grow
I wonder if Tim McGraw's got any of that snifflin night time
Sneezin achin stuffy head coughin
Wake up on the top of your tour bus medicine for me
(coughs)
I sold my leaf blower
My two horsepower push mower
Won't see me outdoors this time of year
(coughs)
This ragweed is a getting rough
My hay fever is getting tough
I'm all out of Vicks Vapo Rub
And there's dust everywhere
And enough is enough
I want to live where the grass don't grow
A big high rise or a small condo
If I never blow again it'll be too soon
Won't ever touch another garden tool
I'll sip Margueritas by the swimming pool
There will be one less seed I'll have to sew
Where the grass don't grow
(Coughs and sneezes)
:Oh my head
Here we go
I want to live where the grass don't grow
It's killing me here where the mulch blowers blow
I've tried everything I know to do
Can't keep the sneezin cough suppressed
Try to give my sinuses a rest
I'm going to go where the pollen count is low
Where the grass don't grow
(Sneezes and coughs till end)"
"You have your ways, I sure have mine
We have our days, things go just fine
Then there are days we?d leave if we could
Should we break it off when it?s not that good?
Fair weather minds need the sunshine
It has to show which way to go
But true blue hearts see through the dark
And keep our minds on days of sunshine
Each of us knows, try as we may
Those bad old days keep coming our way
We're digging in, there's just no retreat
Too many we know are down in defeat
Fair weather minds need the sunshine
It has to show which way to go
But true blue hearts see through the dark
And keep our minds on days of sunshine"
"I wasn't made for the sea
So I keep my anger on me
Won't tumble over or fall apart
I lose direction in the dark
I wasn't made for the flow
Hard times it rolls in my blood
I'm half a native
Half alone
I'll never make it on my own
I wasn't made for the rain
The sound brings me back there again
A lonely sailor looking through
The stillest water
Every glimpse of you"
"Thanks thanks a lot got a broken heart that's all I've got
You made me cry and I cried a lot I lost your love baby thanks a lot
You told our friends as I was passin' by that you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserve everything I've got that's how you feel honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot
You wanted a fool I played the part now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little yeah we laughed a lot and then you're gone honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot
Baby thanks a lot baby thanks a lot baby thanks a lot"
"When you found somebody new
I thought I never would
Forget you
For I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away-ay
Until now, I'm down to hurtin'
Once a day
Once a day (once a day)
A-all day long (all day long)
And o-once a night (once a night)
From dusk till dawn (dusk till dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't go-one
Is once a day
Everyday
All day long
I'm so glad that I'm not like
A girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved
Then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away-ay
Lucky me
I'm only cryin' once a day
Once a day (once a day)
A-all day long (all day long)
And o-once a night (once a night)
From dusk till dawn (dusk till dawn)
The only time
I wish you weren't go-one
Is once a day
Everyday
All day long
Once a day
Everyday
All day lo-ong"
"All the dogs are haunted
And the snow melts on the grass
You were what I wanted
But the fever could not last
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing old
No regrets, they're out the window
Frozen on the silver pane
Gone like winter, let the wind blow
Let the dogs howl at the rain
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing old
Oh, the cats are in the alley
And the rats are on the wire
Time is breathless as a blossom
And it's bursting with desire
And the dogs wander freely
Through the streets of long gone dreams
Drift like ghosts down the back roads
All the way to New Orleans
In the day, I am dreaming
In the night, I am cold
While the stars are up there singing
All the dogs are growing old"
"I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love crashed and burned
I was there.
I was there when love came around
With sweet, warm kisses
I was there when it burned into desire
I was there when it ran into a raging river
And then turned into a runaway wildfire.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
--- Instrumental ---
I was there when love came in
Like a living tornado
And I was there when it blew out of control
I was there when something quickly turned into nothing
Just a hopeless, helpless dream gone up in smoke.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'
At love's final curtain
I was there.
I was there (I was there)
I was there (I was there)
When love came around
I was there.
And one thing certain
I did all the hurtin'..."
"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again"
"A Christmas tree with lights turned low
Kids out of school, praying for snow
It's the season for counting blessings, as the old year ends
The crowded streets, the friendly smiles
At Christmas, everyone's a child
It's that precious time for family and friends
From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
May this Christmas be the best, from our house to yours
Old memories and mistletoe
Cards signed with love, hang in a row
That feeling of Christmas fills the air
The manger scene, the star above
Reminds us all, God sends His love
May His spirit follow you throughout the year
From our house to yours, we send our love
Straight from the heart, 'cause you mean so much
From our house to yours, may everyone be blessed
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
And may this Christmas be the best from our house to yours
Merry Christmas"
"D'Arline, hope this finds you well
There's so much I'm dying to tell, but oh
That's how it goes
Little things left unsaid
That I can't keep in my head but oh
Just so you know
You'll always be the only one
Always be the only one
D'Arline, what do I do now?
Can't live with you or without, but oh
That's how it goes
Though I could get over you
But please don't ask me to
Just so you know
You'll always be the only one
Even when you're not
You'll always be the only one
Even when you're gone
You always said you want me to be happy
And happiness was having you here with me
You'll always be the one that's standing in my way
And that's okay
You'll always be the only one
You'll always be the only one"
"Well its been a year and there so much to tell
Been doing alright in spite of myself
Just wish I could stop feeling bad when I pray
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
Got that job I was dreaming about
Sometimes its tough traveling around
But who I wanna be still seems so far away
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
glad I told you all I meant to
While I had the chance
Cause every moment I had with you
Made me who I am
by the way, I met someone new
And wouldn't you know, she's a whole lot like you
Still I ain't ready to settle down in one place
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
well I guess I'll be moving on
I'll just leave these daisies by your stone
And momma, I still miss you every day
But I know I'm gonna get there someday
when that'll be, guess only God can say
But I know I'm gonna get there someday"
"Blue, I was beginning to think I'd always be
Blue, skies never seemed to follow me
True, love I never thought I'd find
Blue, was in these eyes of mine
You came along just as I was fallin'
Then I found myself fallin' in love with you
I can't remember back then
To the time when I was lonely
Oh thanks to you I'm no longer blue
New, that's how I'm feelin' like I'm your special one
Two, hearts learning to love we've just begun
I'm through, with the past that's all behind me now
Blue, not this time around
You came along just as I was fallin'
Then I found myself fallin' in love with you
I can't remember back then
To the time when I was lonely
Oh thanks to you I'm no longer blue"
"Every girl wants the fairytale
I guess I do too
We're restless, we're young
With so much to prove
You ask me to wait
But wait I won't do
'Cause the time I've been wasting
I could be spending with you
Take me we'll run away
Out of this town 'til it fades
And they'll say we're wrong
But with you I'm alright either way
Money can burn
And money can talk
But it's love that makes the girl
Get up and walk
Ah, all I want's my turn
Yeah, I could be happy just livin' to learn
So take me we'll run away
Out of this town 'til it fades
And they'll say we're wrong
But with you I'm alright either way
Take me we'll run away
Out of this town 'til it fades
And they'll say we're wrong
But with you I'm alright either way
We'll run away
I can't take this town one more day
And they'll say we're wrong
But with you I'm alright either way
Every girl wants the fairytale
I guess I do too"
"Into a life of pain came something beautiful
Someone who loved me as much as I love her
There have been trials and tribulations, and not just a few
But we made it through
And now the time's at hand
We're gonna get married
And have everything
Birdies sing
The bells will ring
Bells of every denomination ringing
We're gonna get married
Take her hand in mine
We'll be lookin' fine
In the sweet sunshine
I hear the people are talkin'
All over town
As we go walking by
Yes, they do
But I don't mind their talkin'
It's all right
'Cause I got my baby to rock me and hold me tight
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
Wait and see
What a grand occasion it's gonna be
All those who love us will be there *
One great big happy family, yes
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
You and me
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
We're gonna get married
Wait and see"
"They say this drinkin? will kill me
And I don't know, oh Lord, it might be true
If I stop I?ll just die from your leavin?
So either way that I go, it?s ?cause of you
Death can come from this broken heart
Or it can come from this bottle
So why prolong the agony
Hey, bartender, I think I?ll hit the throttle
I don't care how the preacher might preach me
About the evils of being drunk with wine
I don't care how the doctor might warn me
?Cause since you left, it?s just a matter of time
Death can come from this broken heart
Or it can come from this bottle
So why prolong the agony
Hey, bartender, I think I?ll hit the throttle
I don't care that my friends have all left me
?Cause they swear that I have gone insane
And I don't care anymore about livin?
Without you, just the grave can ease the pain
Death can come from this broken heart
Or it can come from this bottle
So why prolong the agony
Hey, bartender, I think I?ll hit the throttle
Yeah, they say this drinkin? will kill me
I don't know, oh Lord, it might be true
If I stop, I?ll just die from your leavin?
So either way that I go, it?s ?cause of you
Yeah, either way that I go, it?s ?cause of you
Oh, anyway that I go, it?s ?cause of you"
"Up on the Double Divide
Down on Filberts Rise
I chanced to meet a city girl
With clear blue sparkling eyes
I See those eyes
Down on Filberts Rise
First morning I did see her
Coming in from the West
Storm clouds on the Mountain
And tears all down her breast
Tears a falling
Down on Filberts Rise
Up on the Double Divide
Down on Filberts Rise
Down on Filberts Rise
Down on Filberts Rise
Full well I knew her sorrow
Was no concern of mine
But as I took her in my arms
My own heart soon did pine
Hearts in sorrow
Down on Filberts Rise
Up on the Double Divide
Down on Filberts Rise
Down on Filberts Rise
Down on Filberts Rise
Wild horses and wild rivers run circles around the sun
I see her in the days and nights as they blend into one
I see her in the moonlight and in the starry skies
Some time I even swear I see her
Down on Filberts Rise
I see those eyes
Down on Filberts Rise
I see her in the moonlight and in the starry skies
Some time I even swear I see her
Down on Filberts Rise
I see those eyes
Down on Filberts Rise"
"Don't want to go to the movies
Or spend the day in the park
I don't want no one to call me
I just want to be alone with my heart
And think of the way that you held me
The touch of your lips on my face
Surround myself in your memory
[Chorus]
It's just one of those days
I want to lay in my sorrow
I want to drown in my tears
Don't want to think of tomorrow
Until these thoughts disappear
Then I'll be back on my feet again
Before it's too late
As for now I want to be alone
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
I want to think about Texas
Driving the coast of Malibu
Wherever my minds wants to take us
I don't care long as I'm there with you
Why do I put myself through this when
Most of the time I'm okay
But here and now I can feel it
[Chorus]"
"Yes, you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep
The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
Cause you're known by the company you keep
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keep"
"Lost in foreign tongues
I was stung by your velvet touch
Look to the eyes, so black
They're so cracked, I was your last attack
If you call on me
Then I'm left to see
No, I'll never be that man you wish I'd be
If you call on me
Then I'm left to see,
No I'll never be those things that you should see
See that boy sleeps
Upon steel beams, he's made of dreams
You look to the eyes so black
They're so cracked, I was your last attack
See that little man
Running with his severed hands,
No he'll never work in this town again
See that little man
He's got the severed hands,
And he'll never work in this town again
Lost in foreign tongues
I was stung by your velvet touch"
"Now I love country music
And I guess I always will
But these days when I turn on the radio
It's just not the same thrill
I like a song that gives me chill bumps
Now and then there's some that still do
But I'm fed up with the same old vanilla
Hey how 'bout you
I'm tired of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Hey there mister songwriter
Come and visit in my home
Then tell me about life being perfect
And love that goes on and on and on
Then ride with me in my old Bronco
Down to the factory for eight hours
Then let me introduce you to my supervisor
Then write me a song about sunshine and flowers
And the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
I want to hear a song about passion
I want to hear a song about sin
I want to hear a song about redemption
Yeah sing me one of them
Tell me about a cowboy in Australia
Tell me about a prisoner in China
Tell me about some old stock car driver
Down in Owensburg, South Carolina
Instead of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Same old, same old, same old"
"If she seems cold and bitter I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's been through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember life turned her that way
She's been walked on and stepped on so many times
And I hate to admit it but the last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way
[ piano ]
She's been walked on..."
"I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't something that we find
It's something that we do
It's holding tight, lettin' go
It's flying high and laying low
Let your strongest feelings show
And your weakness, too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't something that we have
It's something that we do
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that you can't tell where I end and where you start
It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand-new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just something that we're in
It's something that we do
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that you can't tell where I end and where you start
Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's something that we do
There's no request too big or small
We give ourselves, we give our all
Love isn't someplace that we fall
It's something that we do"
"When you're standing alone
With the mountains and the sea
Where the arms of the world open wide
Where the truth is as plain as the falling rain
And as sure as the time and the tide
You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men
When you walk down the road
And the sun is on your side
With the sweet river breeze for your face
Where you don't hear a sound as you look around
Everything sort of falls into place
You know we're all His children
His next of kin, that's the way it began
No matter where you're going or where you've been
You're part of the family of men"
"The bartender just told me
I've had too much to drink
Now why's he believing
I give a damn what he thinks
'Cause I can tell he's never felt
the way that I do
He's never had to get over
someone like you
(CHORUS)
I'll be udner the table for I'm over you
Drowning your memory isn't easy to do
And as long as I'm standing, well then I ain't through
'Cause I'll be under the table for I'm over you
It seemed so easy for you to leave me
and find someone new
Then why can't your memory
find somebody too
THere ain't a day that slips away
that I don't think of you more
The only time you're off my mind
is when I'm flat on the floor
(CHORUS)"
"Ever ever after
Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true
Deep down inside we want to believe they still do
And a secret is taught, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all want to make it too
Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away
Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve
Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe
Unafraid, unashamed
There is joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you
Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after
No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through
To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever, ever, ever after
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss
Ooh
For ever ever after"
"Now I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Now I don't care if I'm not the first one you've kissed
Darling I'll never ask
Yesterday's gone just love me from now on
Be true to me forget about the past
Now I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Yesterday's gone"
"Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
Because I find a fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two arms that hold me tight
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
And when he lays his head
Upon his pillow so white
I pray the Lord above
To guide him safe through the night
In dreams I see his face
And feel his fond embrace
There's no one can replace
That little boy of mine.
HOWEVER-----
This is the way my dad sang it to me:
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine
Two eyes that shine so bright
Two arms that hold me tight
Two lips that kiss goodnight
That little boy of mine
No one will ever know
Just what his coming has meant
Because I love him so
He's something heaven has sent
He's all the world to me
He climbs upon my knee
To me he'll always be
That little boy of mine
Who cares for fame or fortune
Who cares for wealth or gold
God's given me my fortune
Within my arms I hold
A tiny turned up nose
Two cheeks just like a rose
So sweet from head to toes
That little boy of mine"
"What am I gonna do now she's gone she's broken every vow
I'll forget her someday somehow what am I gonna do now
Each time I think of the past how love was mine and went away so fast
I've hurt as much as my heart will allow what am I gonna do now
I'm afraid of living alone it looks like that's how I'll be from now on
To have her back I would humbly bow what am I gonna do now
[ ac.guitar ]
To have her back I would humbly bow oh what am I gonna do now"
"Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying just to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go you know you ought to come home
And I'll be right here little baby waitin' for you
I know you've been wild and blue
Wild and blue and it's no wonder
You look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue
And they ought to just take you up to yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue"
"Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say?
How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? What can I say?
What can I say? What can I say?
I hate to think all you had of me
(I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you, space between what was meant to be
(In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
It's never easy, it's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
It's like tryin' to spin the world the other way
What can I say? What can I say?
What can I say?"
"Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now never sayin' what they mean
So they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da la da da da lotten da la a dee de dee
I'm talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
Oh we make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
Oh neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da la da da da...
[Guitar Interlude]
People walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
Then they're tryin' to sock it to you in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da la da da da...
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to remember who I am
Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity and you don't give a lot
Lotten da la da da da...
Yes I'm talkin' bout you and me and the games people play"

"Set your wooden horses to roam
In the dust, come galloping home
Ah, into the grave, sooner or late
You'll be led like a child by the hidden hand of fate
Oh, the silver hearse is in wait
And she revs outside of the gate
Ah, sooner or late, sooner or late
To be snuffed like a flame by the hidden hand of fate
Set your nuclear rockets to aim
When you mingle riches and faith
The rules of the game, sooner or late
Set you're fields of poppies aflame
In your one God?s heavenly name
Ah, sooner or late, sooner or late
You'll be plucked like a fig by the hidden hand of fate
Set your wooden horses to roam
In the dust come galloping home
Ah, into the grave, sooner or late
You'll be led like a child by the hidden hand of fate
you'll be led like a child by the hidden hand of fate
You'll be snuffed like a flame by the hidden hand of fate
Plucked like a fig by the hidden hand of fate
By the hidden hand of fate, ah, ooh by the hidden hand of fate
Ah, ooh by the hidden hand of fate"
"I'm gonna stay right here beside him cause a woman's place is with her man
So many times a man gets lonesome and that's when he needs a helping hand
A woman's hand though so soft and gentle can do so much to help her man
Just holding him each time he needs you the power of love is in a woman's hand
It's a woman's hand that makes a man go searching
It's a woman's hand that's make a man stay home
For he can't do either one without a woman
It's a woman's hand that leads him right or wrong
No he can't do either one..."

Abilene Abilene prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene sweet Abilene
I sat alone most every night watched the trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carryin' me back to Abilene my Abilene
Abilene oh Abilene...

Crowded city there ain't nothing free nothin' in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be back in Abilene sweet Abilene

"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go?
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow?
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
Cause darlin', I do love you so
How many? How many? I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"Love lifts me up
When I'm down at heart
And fills me with a hope that we can start
To change the way we feel
With just a glimpse
Of something real
Every night
We hold on tight
Love makes us strong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
When the world is wicked
And worse for wear
Love's the ticket
To anywhere
It's a journey deep inside
Lift you up into
The wild blue sky
A better life
Is clear in sight
So come along
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
What a complicated
Work of art
This power driven thing
We call the heart
It runs on pure emotion
Stronger than a ragin' ocean
Heaven knows how it flows
On and on
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong"
"Touch me like I touch you
Hold me like I hold you
Kiss me like I kiss you
One more time tonight
Please say you won't leave me
Say you still need me
Say you still love me
One more time,
One more time tonight
I'll dance all night with you
I'll do all you want me to
I'll show you my love is true
One more time tonight
Touch me like I touch you
Hold me like I hold you
Kiss me like I kiss you
One more time for all time
Till' the end of time, tonight"
"I wish to the lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue
All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling don't weep no more
Don't you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
Come back, come back my own true love
And stay awhile with me
For if ever I've had a friend in this world
You've been that friend to me"
"G C
He starts to think when she winks that he's somewhere he shouldn't be

He may be alone but at home someone's wearing his ring

So he heads for the door and ignores the devil on his shoulder

He'll do the right thing but someone's gonna break down and hold her

And there's a vacancy at home but not tonight at the Notel Motel

In a room full of lies where love is stolen or put up for sale

If the walls could talk you know they'd have some stories to tell

Once again another man walks in and orders him drinks for two

"My daddy told me when I was a young girl
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're gonna have to learn to let go
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work
Now here is the one thing I keep forgettin'
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watchin'
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work"
"You were packed and ready to go
To your sister's back in Ohio
I knew you'd made up your mind
I couldn't stop you and you didn't want me to try
The door was open I watched you go
And I knew it was over but I didn't know
It could be that easy to walk away
It could be that easy to make a change
If the heart is willin' to start all over again
It was hard to believe but you showed me
It could be that easy
Three weeks of bein' alone has left me seeing
What I should've seen all along
Your love means so much more
Than I ever told you than I ever showed you before
Now the car is running
And there's a sign out on the lawn
I'm packed and ready
To give up everything I own
It could be that easy to walk away
It could be that easy to make a change
If the heart is willing to start all over again
It was hard to believe but you showed me
It could be that easy
It could be that easy to make a change
Build a new tomorrow from yesterday
If the heart is willin' to start all over again
Oh then so can we, oh you gotta believe
It could be that easy
Baby, it could be that easy"
"(Dolly Parton)
Run that by me one more time
To make sure that I heard you right
I hope you don't expect me to believe that line
I might be crazy, but I ain't dumb
And I know a lie when I hear one
Would you run that by me one more time?
Well, you're late again, I see
What's your excuse this time?
Don't you try to kiss and make up
When you smell so strong from wine
Well, I'm not late, the clock is wrong
You need to wind Big Ben
Honey, that's not wine you smell
That's aftershave for men
Would you run that by me one more time?
What happened to the money
I gave you to pay the rent?
The rent is overdue
And we ain't got one red cent
I put it in the cookie jar
The day you brought it home
One day when I came back from town
I looked and I'll be dogged if that money wasn't gone!
Would you run that by me one more time?
Ha ha would you run that by me one more time
Run that by me one more time...
You keep drinkin' that aftershave it's gonna kill you if I'm lucky
You spent that money didn't you
I didn't spend it I oughta box your jaws
Oh you'd hit your mom before you hit me
Would you run that by me one more time run that by me one more time
I don't want to run that by you one more time
Shot your mouth I don't have to you ain't my pa"
"I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again"
"Time after time I tell myself
That I'm so lucky to be Jule Styne
When things seemed so dark
I walked up to Ray Stark
And I said ""Please meet a friend of mine
Ray Stark, Barbra Streisand, Barbra Streisand, Ray Stark ""
Ms. Streisand sang and I played
He said, ""She looks just like my maid""
Just you do your job and I'll do mine
Which just goes to show
How much producers know
He said, ""Bell bath would be divine""
You all know the switch
The maid, she made him rich
For which he hates Jule Styne"
"The devil went to Jamaica
He was looking to sell some weed
He was doin' fine
They were standin' in line
It was excellent weed indeed
When he came across a young man
Who was likewise peddling pot
And the devil slid down the beach to the kid
And said boy let me tell you what
I guess you kind of figured
I'm a reefer head of course
And after all this time
I guess that I'm a conniseur of sorts
Now your stuff smells okay
But this could tranquilize a horse
I'll bet a million in cash against your stash
Cause I think mines better than yours
The boy said my names Johnny
And you ain't smoked nothing yet
One hit of this grass will kick your a@@
You got yourself a bet
Johnny roll a ball of hash
And make sure it's the bomb
Cause the devils got the kind of stuff they smoked in Vietnam
You'll get a million smack-a-roo's in cash if you can cope
But if you can't the devil gets your dope
The devil packed a bong
With a little Acapulco Gold
And resin flew from his finger tips
As he fired up his bowl
He filled that chamber all the way
And he took a mighty hit
And as they passed it back and forth
It gave them both a coughing fit
(coughing)
When the bowl was finished Johnny said
Hey man, that stuff was great
But fill your lungs with some of this
And prepare to vegetate
Cannibis Sativa, Sweet Maryjane
The devils in the backyard frying his brain
Zig-Zag filled with the diggity-dank
Hold on tight it will hit you like a tank
The devil nodded off
Because he knew that he was stoned
And he asked if he could by an ounce
Of the stuff that Johnny owned
Johnny said, Devil just come on back
If you ever wanna catch a buzz
I done told you once
You son of a bi$^h
Mine's the best there ever was
And they fired up doobies one by one
Ain't gonna stop until the bag is done
Green as a bullfrog
Sticky as glue
Granny do you get high, yes I do"
"Girl don't look at me that way for the things I must do
For it's not that I love you less there's just nothing left to do
But understand my reasons that I ask to be set free
They're small ones but they mean the world to me
Little reasons that say daddy I love you bring me a prize
Little faces that light up each night when I pull in the drive
I wouldn't have you hurt girl and you know love's flame hasn't dimmed
But I can't take the chance of losing them
She doesn't know about us but I've got to do what's right
For it's my fault not hers that loves sweet dawn has turned to night
It was good between us once so it's up to me to try
And hope little reasons can save old love's life
Little reasons that say"
"I can't erase the miles or the lines on my face
There's no need for me to wonder where I might have been
I can't get nowhere without this lonesome road
andI can't remember what happened to my friends
Chorus: This lonesome highway and the wasted miles I've gone
Lonesome highway, leads away from home and tomorrow
I'll be here again
On this lonesome highway, where I've never been
I can't cross the river without bridges that I've burned
I'll have to go an extra mile to find a different way
I keep on riding on this lonesome road
I can't remember where I was yesterday
Chorus: This lonesome highway and the wasted miles I've gone
Lonesome highway, leads me back to home and tomorrow
I'll be here again
On this lonesome highway, where I've always been"
"We work in the factories and the fields

We're the tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're a herd of Longhorn steers
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
Shoot twenty-four and eighty-eight
We crank up our music Friday nights
On two thousand country stations
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
We might fix your water pump, your AC
Bring your apple pie, and fill your glass of tea
Take that Fedex package to your door
But underneath that apron or that uniform
We're Wild Cats, Wolverines
We're Tigers, Buckeyes, Bruins
Bulldogs, Hogs, and Hurricanes
We pray before we race
Cheer fourteen and forty-eight
We drink ice-cold beer on Friday nights
Yeah, we're one big country nation, that's right
We're all across the map
Down city streets and old dirt roads
We're the fabric of this nation
And we're a nation all our own
We're Mountaineers, we're volunteers
We're Devils, Heels, and Rebels

We soup up our Chevrolets

"Yeah, I grew up ten minutes from the sticks
Ten minutes from the beach
And there ain't a Bible verse, y'all
I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and Dad up in the bleachers
Screaming while I pitch
Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town
With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say
Before it's too late
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
Yeah, I'm a long haired, tattooed, feather in the wind
Yeah, a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing
I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw
Got the best seats in the house
When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots
I'm so of proud of where I came from
This town is who I am
And the way I was raised up
Made me a better man
I'm proud of where I came from
And damn I love this land
And the way that I was raised up
Made me a better man
You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go

Gotta whole lotta girls in a little backseat
Touch up my face

Girls are gonna play and say

I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me
All those threats I made about leavin
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week
Chorus
She handed me my walking papers
And said you're free to go
And celebrating felt in order
For I had escaped that prison of a home
But sittin in this old tavern
Surrounded by my good timing friends
I see I'll never make it on the outside
And I'm thinkin bout how I'm gonna break back in
Daylight found me sleepin in my car
On the other side of her street
And the grass that used to be my front yard
Had never before looked so green
And I'm tempted to break for the front door
But I'm sure she'd sic the dogs on me
Cause it looks like she's got a new inmate
Cause there's a pickup in the drive I've never seen
Chorus
I'm thinkin about how I'm gonna break back in"
"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"
"I can see your mansion on the hill
Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you've revealed
Yes you said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
[ piano ]
I've waited all through the years love to give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow in your loveless mansion on the hill
The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still
And I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
In your loveless mansion on the hill"
"She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too
But memories turn black and white, at least mine do...
She said my brother, you know, he used to have this friend...
But this is now and that was then
It's better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart
I said if you could count up memories but only keep the best
You may not see how good they were without the rest
She said look I tried a lot
But I guess love it don't like me
Oh and by the way, all those tries?
Sure didn't come for free
So it's better off just not to start
Than to have to watch us fall apart
All because of my second hand heart
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Second hand hearts
Are not just for parts
So I'll take away your sad luck baby
And you'll change mine
When hurt starts talkin' we'll say hey, ya know, we ain't got time
Then pick up all those small hopes back off the ground
'Cause after years of tears it's hard to say what's up or down
So if you will, I'll try to start
And take the chance that we might fall apart
To try and save our second hand hearts
She said when I trusted love I dreamed in color too..."
"When you lie in your bed
Running dreams through your head
Now and then think of me
Spare a moment for two
For the love that we knew now and then
Think of me
And I'll keep you apart from the rest of my heart
Above every feeling I have ever known
One love reins supreme
In my castle of dreams
In my heart dear you stand all alone
Only one
There's one only one you'll see
Only one
One heart in all eternity
And Darling you're the only one for me
When you take from the past
All the memories that last let me know
I'll be there
Don't let time take away every sweet yesterday
Let me know you still care
Through sunshine and rain
Through laughter and pain
I'll carry the flower of the love you have sown
There will be others I guess
But I will always confess
In my heart dear you stand all alone
Only one
There's one only one you'll see
Only one
One heart in all eternity
And Darling you're the only one for me
Only one
There's one only one you'll see
Only one
One heart in all eternity
And Darling you're the only one for me
Only one
There's one only one you'll see
Only one
One heart in all eternity
And Darling you're the only one for me
And Yes Darling you're the only one for me"
"The war began and Henry left his farm
Left his darling Molly with a baby in her arms
Now the war was over and their life could begin
Molly saw her darling standing at the door again
It's so nice to hear your voice again Molly
So nice to feel your arms around me Molly
Oh how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet sweet Molly please don't cry
Maybe I should have written to let you know ahead a time
But I was afraid that you'd worry if you knew that I'd gone blind
Do I hear you crying Molly please don't cry you silly thing
See what you've done you've even brought a tear into my eye
Oh how happy I'd be if I only could see you
Sweet sweet Molly please don't cry
Where's my son why does he looks like Molly
Everybody says he took after me Lord I wish I could see
Come here little man don't be afraid I'm your daddy
Guess he'll get used to me in time won't he Molly
It's so nice to hear your voice again Molly
Please don't cry"
"Well I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
The moon comes up and the sun goes down
I can't wait to see the lights of town
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
And when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Well I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
And when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the jukebox moaning those honky tonk sounds
I can't wait to lay my money down
'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home
I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old jukebox
But when my money's all gone,
I'm on the telephone singing
Hey hey mama can your daddy come home"
"Ooh ooh ooh ooh sorry, ooh ooh ooh ooh sorry
Well I came home from work in the middle of the day
Two hours early, but a little too late
She was coming down the stairs, looking mighty grand
With a big brown suitcase in her hand
I said, ""What's goin' on, baby, what's the deal""
She said, ""I just don't feel like I used to feel""
With the devil's own smile right out of the blue
She said, ""I done went and found myself somebody new""
She said,
Sorry it didn't work out
Sorry, guess I'll see you around
She ruined my life, left me broken hearted
And all she had to say was, ""Sorry""
Well, I laid awake cryin' for many a night
I just couldn't seem to get her off my mind
I went to her, got down on my knees
Said, ""Baby, won't ya please come back to me""
She said,
Sorry it didn't work out
Sorry, guess I'll see you around
She ruined my life, left me broken hearted
And all she had to say was, ""Sorry""
Well, time went by and my poor heart healed
I found me a woman who's love is real
Man she's a looker, the apple of my eye
And every head turns when she walks by
Well, we ran into my old flame the other day
It blew my mind what she had to say
She said, ""Hello, baby, well how have you been
I was hopin' maybe we could get together again""
And I said,
Sorry it didn't work out
Sorry, guess I'll see you around
You ruined my life and left me broken hearted
And all you had to say was, ""Sorry""
You said, ""Sorry"""
"I don't think that I should be here anymore
You've watched me pack
And now you're standing by the door
I've gotta strange feeling,
Even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're ain't really crying but you're trying
I don't see a single teardrop falling
I've gotta strange feeling,
Even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
You don't treat me like you used to
Why don't you come right out
And say we're through
I've gotta strange feeling
Lately you ain't even talking to me
So how come I'm the one feeling guilty
You don't love me like you used to
So come right out and say we're through
I've gotta strange feeling,
Even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Hey, I've gotta strange feeling,
Even though I'm leaving
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Hey, I've gotta strange feeling,
Even though I'm leaving
That you're not gonna miss me when I'm gone
Mm, when I'm gone,
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone (you're not gonna miss me)
When I'm gone
Well, you're not gonna miss me
(when I'm gone)
You're not gonna miss me (when I'm gone)
You're not gonna miss me when I'm gone"
"I need you and I want you 'cause I know you from before
I hate you and I fear you but I hold open the door
I see you and you see me and we know what must be done
So we draw knives and lock eyes 'cause it does no good to run
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
I've missed you, you know that's true and I've retraced every scar
My head sings and the steel rings 'cause we've traveled, oh so far
I chased you to embrace you like the sun chases the moon
I burn you and you burn me but I know I'll see you soon
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
I've watched you and I've seen you and known that you were there
I've held and you've loved me but our lives cannot be spared
I trust you and despised you, shadowed your every move
Scorned you and warned you, befriended everyone you've used
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams
Goodbye old friend, farewell it seems
We'll dance again in my dreams"
"When my liquor cabinet is empty
And the local package store is closed
I am paid a visit by an enemy
And the s.o.b. goes by bully jones
He loves showing up out of nowhere
And getting under my skin
The sad thing is he's going to stay there
If I don't score again
Bully jones bully jones bully jones
Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
Bully jones bully jones bully jones
Big bad dude sure ain't very pretty
His ugly is awfully hard to take
He looks just like a cold turkey
With a real bad case of the shakes
He don't pick on men his own size
He knows he can't win with those
He likes us pale and sick guys
Who are only skin and bones
Bully jones bully jones bully jones
Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned
Bully jones bully jones bully jones
I got some good friends who tie off
And some who tie one on
And just like me they have all lost
The fight with bully jones

Someday I'm gonna beat him
He'll kill me if I don't
But until I can defeat him
I'll keep on getting stoned

"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
[Chorus]
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.
[Chorus]
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""
[Chorus]"
"Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart
What is your future?, now we have to part
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay
Make way, oh, make way for my Eastern Rose
Men crowd in dozens everywhere she goes
In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret
""Please make way for Rose"" you can hear them say
All my life I shall remember
Oriental music and you in my arms
Perfumed flowers in your tresses
Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms
Rose, Rose I love you with your almond eyes
Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies
I must cross the seas again and never see you more
Way back to my home on a distant shore
(All my life I shall remember)
(Oriental music and you in my arms)
(Perfumed flowers in your tresses)
(Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms)
Rose, Rose I leave you, my ship is in the bay
Kiss me farewell now, there's nothing to say
East is East and West is West, our worlds are far apart
I must leave you now but I leave my heart
Rose, Rose I love you with an aching heart
What is your future?, now we have to part
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay
(Rose, Rose I love you, I cannot stay)"
"The truth is too painful
This moment too real
Saying good-bye
But loving you still
Too late to start over
We've tried that before
And I just don't have it in me
To try anymore
Chorus:
But I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know you've tried
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever do in my life
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
2nd chorus:
I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know I'll ask why
I know I'll have moments
When I'll want to die
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
Tag:
And the longest night
I'll ever spend will be tonight
'cause I know no good way of saying"
"Nothing ever turns out like you thought it would
Spare me some patience if you could
Sometimes it feels like you're watching the sun
From a rain cloud far from home
Tomorrow, we've always got tomorrow
Somedays it feels like your bags are packed
But there's nowhere to go
And no clock to turn back
When the sun goes down while it's cold outside
And your soul needs something
Just to keep you alive
Tomorrow, we've always got tomorrow
Tomorrow, we've always got tomorrow
Nothing ever turns out like you thought it would
Spare me some patience if you could"
"He's got a fuzzy white beard 'neath a great big smile
A bright red hat you could see for a mile
A bag full of goodies and a great big grin
Here comes Santa Claus, again
All year he been a workin' and a buildin' toys
All for the good little girls and boys
He come down the chimney with the great big grin
Here comes Santa Claus, again
[Bridge]
He's got little toy soldiers, all red and blue
A lots of little vowels that say I love you
A dress for mama and a pipe for dad
Santa sure makes a lotta people feel glad
[Chorus]
So hang your stockings, and go to bed
Say your prayers and cover your head
And while you're sleeping his fun begins
Here comes Santa Claus, again
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Santa Claus is here, again"
"I can see right out my window
Walking down the street
My girl, with another guy
His arms around her
Like it used to be with me
Hey man, it makes me want to die
Yeah yeah yeah
Here comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa whoa whoa yeah
There they go
It's funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept the fact
She's chosen him
And simply let them be
Whoa whoa whoa
Here comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa whoa whoa yeah
She's with him he's turning down the lights
And now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes
And telling him lies exactly like she told me too
Whoa whoa whoa
Here comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa whoa whoa yeah"
"Down in my hometown there is a fortune
They used call it gold but now it's love I'm told
With a worried mind I put my time in
But hunger comes and goes even while the wild wind blows
Now I could sing you a song of inspiration
Or of new world where everyone is free
But know you there ain't no new way to salvation
The time is gettin' short my friends for you and me
Down in my hometown there is a fortune
They used call it gold but now it's love I'm told
Now when I left there, my eyes cast down in sorrow
So very soon I found the darkness on the ground
And now I see the clouds gatherin' for tomorrow
But I must journey on the one road I have found"
"I got the feeling when I
Looked at you tonight
That you've given up trying
Have you left it up to me
To be the one to keep our love from dying
If I could I'd take you in my arms
And bring us back to being close
But how can I hold you
If you're letting go
I won't pretend I've got the
Answers figured out
But I can't stop believing
Hanging on to what we got
Is still a better way to go
Than leaving
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go
So please don't let this be the end
Hold out some hope that we can try again
I'd do anything to make you stay
But I can't do it all alone
How can I hold you
If you're letting go"
"I don't know what you're doin', but baby I just had to find out
Maybe it's too soon to call you, but it's too late now
I've been thinkin' about the way you move
And the way you look when I look at you
And I just can't wait, tomorrow's too late
[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
You can be here in a song, I'll meet you at the end of the street
All we gotta lose is a lonely city night and some sleep
And if you gotta go, I'll walk you home
Or if you don't wanna wake up alone
Come on, come on, don't wait too long
[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
Closer tonight
Don't think about it too much
Just get in the car
You're too far away
If you're anywhere but in my arms, uh, huh
[Chorus]
Baby just come over, we should be a little closer tonight
Let's drink a little something and do a lot of nothin' all night
We can take it slow or we can go wherever you're feelin' like
It really doesn't matter as long as we get closer tonight
Closer tonight, oh, ohh"
"I told the whippoorwill told the daffodil just bout your pretty smile
Yes I told them all about you
I told the little bird every single word that you said worthwhile
Yes I told them all about you
I told that big old melody with shine above
How you roll on big blue eyes and how you could love
Each a little honeybee said there's gonna be honeymoon for two
Yes I told them all about you
[ ac.guitar ]
I told the whippoorwill..
Yes I told them all about you yes I told them all about you"
"I threw our rings into a box
Filled with broken memories and fools gold
And I woke up again last night in this lonely bed without you to hold
And I walked around the house pullin' pictures off the walls
Just like I've done a hundred times before
Makin sure I've got 'em all
Chorus
Makin sure I've got the hard to find
Little things that make me think about you
'Cause I'm tired if this house always breakin' me down, feelin blue
No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away
Well, yesterday I found your dress
I guess there's some things I missed in our room
But it didn't break me down the second that I found it like it used to
With red wine and tears I've been gatherin' all the years we spent together
I need to move on
'Cause I know you're gone forever
Repeat Chorus
No there's nothing left to say
I'm puttin' memories away"
"C'mon
A click clacking my heart keeps making an ominous sound
That chain keeps dragging me up just to drop me back down
I think I'm over the hump enough to see the other side
That's when another thought of you runs through my mind
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
It's out of control
Round and round, upside down and down upside
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Psychedelic trip, my stomach flips again and again
I'd love to get my ticket back but I'm locked in
A white knuckle grip hanging onto what's left of my life
I hate to think about to coming down when I'm up this high
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
Pain points his gun
And I hold my hands up high
Off the edge I go
On this roller coaster ride
Hang on
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride
Up and down I go
Over you, about to lose my mind
It's out of control
Round and round,
Upside down and down upside
Since you had to go
I've been on a roller coaster ride"
"She hates her job, loves her kids
Bored with her husband
Tired of the same old list of things to do
So when the to-dos have all been done
She sits down at the kitchen table
And rolls herself a fat one
Smoke so sweet fills the air
She maybe ought to crack a window
But all she can do is stare at the paint
That's been peeling off the walls
A couple tokes and her troubles don't seem all that tall
[Chorus]
You know life will let you down
Love will leave you lonely
Sometimes to only way to get by
Is to get high
She laughs out loud at who she used to be
A girl who'd a looked down on
A woman's moking weed in her kitchen
Sometimes she misses those younger days
Seeing the world through rose colored glasses
Instead of this purple haze
[Chorus]
You know life will let you down
Love will leave you lonely
Sometimes to only way to get by
Is to get high
So she tucks her kids in at night
Kisses her husband turns off the light
And talks to God
Says Lord gel me accept what I cannot change
But until I learn to do that
Thanks for the Mary Jane"
"At first mom and papa called their little boy Ned
They raise him on the banks of the river bed
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree a home for my papa and my mama and me
The clock strikes three papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cookin' papa somethin' to eat
At half past papa he's ready to go he jumps in his piro headed down the bayou
He's got fishin' lines strung across the Louisiana River
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
Headin' crops in the swamp catchin' everythin' he can
Gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man gotta make a livin' he's a Louisiana man
Muskart hides a hangin' by the dozen even got a lady make a muskart's cousin
Pile of hide drying in the hot hot sun tomorrow papa's gonna turn them into money
Well they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
A little baby brother on the floor that's Mac
Riz and Liz are the family twins big brother Ed's on the bayou fishin'
On the river float papa's great big boat that's how my papa goes into town
He takes every bit of the night and day
Then ever reach the place where the people stay
I can hardly wait till tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his fure to town
Papa promised me that I could go even let me see a cowboy show
I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then I told my papa gotta go again
Papa said son we got the lines to run we'll come back again there's work to be done
He's got fishin' lines..."
"I can't live with you when you try to own me
Though you may give me love like I have never known
But if you try to control me then you won't never know me
And I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
So love me just for what I am don't try to change a thing
And I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the same
So if you want to love me you must understand all of me
For I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
And I have no control over what I feel inside
And I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfied
So if you think you can't be without place and chance on me
Then I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
I have no control
I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong"
"Well I love to wander on a sandy shore
And I love to wander down the streets of towns I've never been before
Take me somewhere out of reach lie in unfamiliar sheets
And hear the ocean roar ask for more I could not do just as long as you're there too
Just as long as I have you I'll go anywhere
Just as long as you're there too I don't really care
I'll go anywhere you want cause with you's where I belong
I've just got to have you to make my life complete
I've just got to have you there to be a part of everything I see
In the windows I walk past in the mirror in the morning in my photographs
In the candlelight cafes let me always see your face
And oh it really doesn't matter just where the road leads
To the top of a mountain or down to the sea
Just as long as I have you...
Just as long as I have just as long as I have"
"I can't believe that after all this time
You keep slipping back across my mind
Did we maybe leave a love behind
Afraid of what we felt
Other loves I've had have come and gone
I don't know why they just don't last too long
There are questions that go on and on
That time won't tell
Time won't tell me how it might have been
Time won't make what's wrong alright
It can only take me back again
And re-run all those memories in black and white
I watch us kiss goodbye that day
Here's where you turned around and walked away
What were the words that would have made you stay
Time won't tell
You never see the road you didn't take
You never feel the love you fail to make
To never know may be the worst mistake
Cause time won't tell
No, time won't tell..."
"Got the blues in Batton Rouge walked a mile or two then caught her eye
I got out in Memphis she smiled at me and slowly said goodbye
She asked me if I'd like to tag along a little farther down the line
But travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me
Here I am in Memphis without a dime or a place to sleep
Sure is hot and sweaty the tar is even bubbling on the street
None of this bothered me that's the only cup o'tea that I can drink
Cause travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me
I may move on in the morning and never know just how long I'll stay
Sometimes I'll stay a month or two sometimes I don't even stay a day
No one tried to tie me down and it's quite a friendly town I'll stick around
Cause travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me
I've tried a lot of steady jobs but never seen one make me happy yet
I've lived my life so many ways tried everything and now I know what's best
I wouldn't trade with anyone a billion dollars wouldn't move me none
Cause travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me
Cause travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me
Cause travelin' round and bein' free that's only way life's good to me"
"Never (no I will) never ever grow tired of you
Never (no I will) never ever stop loving you
And you will never have to cry cause I will never make you blue
There will never be a cloud to keep the sun from shining through
Never (no I will) never ever stop loving you
[ steel ]
And you will never have to cry..."
"There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw
[Chorus]
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
The sky is blue
But from where i stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What i wouldn't give if i could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again
[Chorus: x2]"
"She ain't got no money
Clothes are kinda funny
Hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
She talks kinda lazy
People say she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me
There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling so fine
That I just gotta say
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away
I'm a lucky fella
And I just gotta tell her
That I love her endlessly
Oh, cause love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me"
"Mem'ries, I've got a million of those mem'ries in my mind
Mem'ries, I think I've got enough to leave you behind
Ohh, mem'ries, they used to make me warm but now I find
Mem'ries only make me feel old before my time
Mem'ries, try not to think about the mem'ries all the time
Mem'ries, forget the days when your sweet love was mine
Ohh, mem'ries, I used to welcome them but now I find
Mem'ries only make me feel old before my time"
"If there's a full moon hanging high
You can bet there's a jacked up four wheel drive
Cruising with the crew with a beer on ice,
Looking for the girls that'll let their hair down
Lead us on, get us thinking they might
Share a little sugar on a Friday night
Making midnight memories lighting up the sky
In the country side we turn it up loud
Down here we keep the good times flowing,
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it,
Yeah me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys
We're tighter than the tops will twist off
When the sun goes down and the work day's gone
Like something straight out of a country song,
Raised up all farm tan tough
With the scuffs all over our boots
Little rough tangled up in our roots
Yeah, we got a little soft side too
When the girls get us all wrapped up
Down here we keep the good times flowing,
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it,
Yeah me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys
Down here we keep the good times flowing,
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it,
Yeah me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys
No, ain't nothing ever gonna come between us
Like me and my down home boys
Yeah me and these dawn home boys
Like me and my dawn home boys"
"There are only so many tears you can cry,
Till your heart stops breaking.
Only so many doors you can try,
Till you finally find your way.
Out of the dark, into the light,
No, the clouds won't always be grey.
The sun reappears in the blink of an eye,
And there's only so many tears you can cry.
There are only so many reasons to give up,
You're not even close.
You got to believe in the power of love,
That's all anyone knows.
And what makes you strong comes from inside,
And as far as weather and woes.
Buckets of rain can fall from the sky,
But there's only so many tears you can cry.
Get on with it, get on with life,
Forget about who's wrong or right.
Come out and dance with me tonight,
And we'll laugh, laugh, laugh those tears away."
"My heart beats with the lonely rain,
Wishin' I could see your face again.
Change the dial on the radio,
Find somethin' playin' kinda bluesy an' slow.
If things were only like they used to be,
With you lyin' in love tonight.
I wish you'd call me on the telephone,
I don't wanna spend another night alone.
Sleepin' with the radio on,
It's the only way I can make it till dawn.
Sleepin' with the radio on,
You're on my mind 'an I can't forget you.
It's gettin' late, almost quarter-to-four.
I hear a knock at my door.
Stumble in the dark an' hear your voice again,
Open up the door an' let the sunshine in.
Take me in your arms an' make love nice an' slow.
It's so good to be this close to you.
No more nights of sleepin' alone,
No more days with these lovesick blues.
'Cause we'll be sleepin' with the radio on,
Let's take the rest of the day together.
An' I'll unplug the telephone,
Now that you're here, I'm gonna love you forever."
"I don't know how many times I've heard it
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect
But there's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out there
She gives the sun a pretty good run for it's beauty
Don't know where she is but the thought of her kiss still moves me, yeah
There's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out there
There's a girl out there
Used to sit on my tailgate
Talk about her hometown
She'd take me there someday
There's a girl out there
She danced in her bare feet
Sang along with the radio
Even though she was off key
If you ever meet her you'll know you've seen her I swear
There's a girl out, there's a girl out there
There's a girl out there
I don't know how many times I've heard it
You can't find it there's no such thing as perfect
But there's a girl out there"
"Everywhere I go reminds me
Of someplace down in Texas
And every time I close my eyes
I dream of my old home
And oh it's gettin' so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
Everyone I know reminds me
Of someone down in Texas
And every strip mall on the highway
Reminds me of my home
And oh I'm tired of roamin' round
There's too many goin' down
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
Every time I close my eyes
I dream of someone in Texas
And every strip mall along the highway
Reminds me of my home
And oh it's gettin' so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
And oh it's always so cold 'round here
There's too many cars 'round here
And though I want to open up my heart
There's too many parties
There's too many cars 'round here...
There's too many cars 'round here...
There's too many cars 'round here...
And too many parties...
And too many parties...
And too many parties..."
"Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
Tempted and tried will oft make you wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
When death has found and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year"
"Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
In my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord don't hide your face from me
Hold my hand all the way every hour every day from here to the great unknown
Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone
[ guitar ]
Like a king I may live in a palace so tall with great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world that's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way..."
"I remember when it all began
You couldn't keep your body
From my hands
I remember nights we felt
So close
How we got so distant
I don't know
So as you plan
Your brand new life
Keep this one thing in mind
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will live you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
People change
And baby so do dreams
They move along
To where the grass is green
So I won't hold you down
To what we had
Last thing I want to do
Is make you sad
But is things don't fly your way
Girl it's never too late
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again
The door's wide open
Baby walk right in
I'll be waitin'
'Til the end of time
Heart and mind
Now just like back then
If you ever feel
Like needin' someone
Who will live you
Like I've always done
Girl I'll show you
Some things never end
If you ever feel
Like lovin' me again"
"Last night you went out again with what you said was your best friend
You say you need some time away from me
The sun was high when you got in but not as high as you had been
And I wonder how you would act if I done just the way I pleased
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
Well let me tell you this big boy when you go out for a night of joy
You better start taking me along or you'll be singing a different song
For I've been married just as long as you have
While I'm working hard all day you run around and spend my pay
You entertain your friends at my expence
But you cry and carry on when I do something on my own
And you accuse with lack of evidence
I've been married just as long as you have
And I get tired of the same old things just the same as you have
So let me tell you this sweetheart I figure I've done my part
So don't get cute and get so smart I'll tell you this before you start
I've been married just as long as you have"
"If you think, you can depend on me
Your right, you can
If you think, that I'm in love with you
Your right, I am
But nuthin' lasts forever
All good thing's must end
And it's only, a matter, of time
Day after forever
I'm out that door
One way or the other
To return never more
Don't count on me baby
For I will be gone
Day after forever
Honey, you're on your own
If you think, I love you more than life
You're right, I do
If you think, your in my heart and soul
Your right, it's true
But I must leave you someday
Although I worship you
And it's only, a matter, of time
Day after forever
I'm out that door
One way or the other
To return never more
Don't count on me baby
For I will be gone
Day after forever
Honey, you're on your own"
"I take out my guitar and strum all my dreams
It's somewhere around here I know
Don't let me chase rainbows that don't would have an end
There must be a song I can sing
Where is the melody and where are the words where is the rhythm of the drum
And where are the voices that can make my heart bring
I know there's a song I can sing
And if I keep trying find a secret to wake me from my dream
That sleeps on the footsteps of my soul
Some day I'll hear the music that can bring my voice swings
Cause I know there's a song I can sing
Yes some day I'll hear the melody and I'll find the words
And I'll feel the rhythm of the drum
And I'll listen to the voices that can make my heart bring
Yes somewhere there's a song I can sing
Yes some day I'll hear the melody..."
"Now I'm just a bartender
And I don't like my work
But I don't mind the money at all
I see lots of sad faces
And lots of bad cases
Of folks with their backs to the wall
I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
I can light up your smokes
I can laugh at your jokes
I can watch you fall down on your knees
I can close down this bar
Go and gas up my old car
I can pack up, oh Lord, and mail in the key
I need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away
Now the smoke fills the air in this honky-tonk bar
And I'm thinking 'bout where I'd rather be
But I burned all my bridges and I sank all ships
Now I'm stranded at the edge of the sea
I still need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
And a honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away"
"I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and his glory,
Of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story,
Because I know 'tis true;
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do.
I love to tell the story,
'twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love.
I love to tell the story,
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
'twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long.
I love to tell the story,
'twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and his love."
"That call was from the office and I guess I'll have to burn the midnight oil again
And hon' you know how much the boss depends on me to lend a helping hand
I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
The girls all got together and they called to see if I could have some fun tonight
But you know me the only thing I do is go to work and watch TV
And I watch him in the mirror as I lie and tell him I don't know how late I'll be
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
And tonight I'll cheat again and tomorrow I'll be sorry
And I'll feel kind of dirty cause I'll have the midnight oil all over me
God knows his dream would shatter if he knew the devil had me and won't set me free
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me
While I'm puttin' on my makeup I'm puttin' on the one that really loves me"
"I believe every lyin' word you told to me
When you whispered your sweet love belonged to me
How was I to know you would let me down
Well that's how this lonely king won this lonely crown
So long live the king the king of fools the king with the castle filled with gloom
A king whose treasures are just memories of you
Long live the king the lonely king of fools
When your fling is through I know that you'll be back once more
And the king of fools will take you back just like before
You'll fool me till you find somebody new
Then once again I'll be the lonely king of fools
So long live the king..."
"Lonesome number one
Just call me lonesome number one
Although no titles have I won
I surely must be lonesome number one
Every love I've had has faded like a dew
Everyone I wanted has wanted someone new
Heartaches hang around they always come
I surely must be lonesome number one
Lonesome number one
Seems I'm always losing, love just can't come near
Just when love gets close it always disappears
Sorrow always keeps me on the run
I surely must be lonesome number one"
"I left my old home in the mountains
And the only friends I ever had
And while I rambled this world over
My heart felt so lonely and sad
I'm going back to the old home
Back to the place I love so well
Where the sweet waters flow and the wildflowers grow
Back to the old home on the hill
I know that dear old mother's waiting
Waiting alone on that hill
With the silver in her hair and a twinkle in her eye
In the old cabin home on the hill
Years have gone by since I saw her
I've traveled many a mile
But tonight there's a light in the window
And she's waiting at the door with a smile"
"Talk that same old talk again
Just the way you did back then
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long, long time
Say the things you used to say
Make me feel the same old way
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long, long time
Does it ever stop changing
Does it ever change at all
How can we pick up the pieces
After we let them fall
If they ever were there at all
Does it ever stop changing
Does it ever change at all
How can we pick up the pieces
After we let them fall
If they ever were there at all
The same old look is in your eyes
The feelin's that you can't disguise
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long, long time
Do the things you used to do
Make me fall in love with you
A feelin' that I almost left behind
It's been such a long, long time"
"I didn't think too much about books and schoolin'
Cause there are more important things to do
I'd just sit out in the yard and pick my ol' banjo
Tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do
I would sit there by the hour pickin' Wildwood Flower
Wore my little fingers to the bone
I said I'll never rest till I am the very best
The best banjo picker in this whole country
[ banjo ]
I said someday I know I'll win my fame one day all the world will know my name
I'll work so very hard with that ol' banjo tryin' to do what the big hillbillies do
I would sit there all alone tryin' to pick out Home Sweet Home
While evrybody played out in the yard
I said I'll never stop till I've reached the very top
When I'm the best banjo picker in this whole country
[ banjo ]
Well the years have passed I haven't change my mind I still pick the banjo all the time
Because I know someday I'm bound to learn to play all the things the big hillbillies do
I just sit here in my shop pickin' Foggy Mountain Top tellin' everybody help theirselves
Cause before I go to rest I'm gonna be the very best
The best banjo picker in this whole country
(I'm gonna learn how to play this thing
I'm gonna play the banjo just like Sonny Osborne yes sir Sonny I'm gonna learn)"
"That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
When we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on
Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on
Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on
I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on
You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
'Cause I'm movin on
But someday baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on"
"As much as I love you
I don't understand you, oh girl
It's almost as though you prefer me to them
Just on the fringe of your world
As much as I love you
You're costing me part of my mind
What am I supposed to do with the part of me
That you don't want but part of the time
As much as I love you
Why do you lock me outside
And only let me in every now and then
What are you trying to hide
As much as I love you
I don't understand how you think
Don't you know that it's wrong turnin' me off and on
Like water you pour down the sink
As much as I love you
It's cold on my side of the bed
It's been another day of bein' pushed away
And I don't know what I've done or said
As much as I love you
I'm lying here wondering why
I don't take off my ring
Pack up my things leave and don't even say goodbye
Mhm, mhm"

He's watchin' TV drinking beer and singing crazy songs
He don't ever yell at us so something must be wrong
Cause daddy's been around the house too long)

He gets up drinks his coffee and reads the want ads
Then he wanders round the house or maybe mows the lawn
Daddy's been around the house too long)
Oh I wanna hear that factory whistle blow just the way it used to sound before
And maybe it'll scare away the wolf that's at my door
I wanna hear that factory whistle blow

'Bout the time the fireworks hit the sky
And you said, ""Happy Independence day, oh, and by the way I'm leavin'""
I didn't know you could be so cut and dry
So sad, goodbye
(So sad, goodbye)
No rhyme no reason why it's just
Good love, gone bad

I lost the best that I ever had
I gotta pick up pieces of my shattered dreams
While the world spins right out from under my feet
So sad, good love gone bad
The ways of love are tough and steep
Keeps teachin' me the hard way
Guess what, I think this time I finally learned
So if you find yourself at home alone don't you dial my number
'Cause I won't be here where we're concerned, oh, yeah
So sad, goodbye

No rhyme no reason why it's just
Good love, gone bad

You lost the best that you ever had
You gotta pick up pieces of your shattered dreams
While the world spins right out from under your feet
So sad, good love gone bad
It's all so sad

"CRAZY ARMS
(Ralph Mooney - Chuck Seals)
'56 Tree Publishing, BMI / Songs Of Universal, BMI
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
Now blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to...
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to..."
"A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
Well a poor boy's chances
For a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money,
If you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you
A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree"

"Ashes of love cold as ice you made the debt I'll pay the price
Our love is gone there's no doubt ashes of love the flames burned out
The love light that gleam in your eyes has gone out to my surprise
We said goodbye my heart bled I can't revive your love is dead
Ashes of love cold as ice
I trusted dear our love would stand your every wish was my command
My heart tells me I must forget I loved you then I love you yet
Ashes of love cold as ice
Ashes of love cold as ice"

"Why hey there why you look so sad?
What did he say to make you feel so bad?
Well I guarantee that I'd never do nothing like that, no.
So what you got planned on Friday night?
Could put your red dress on or stay home and cry.
I guarantee I got a quick fix that you might like, that's right.
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what,
You can damn sure try.
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Come on, give it a shot, give it a dance
I ain't asking a lot, just give me a chance
I'm gonna right his wrong right where I stand
I'ma hit you with a kiss, spinning like a hurricane
Tell me baby what do ya say?
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what,
You can damn sure try.
Don't you wanna try, babe?
Turn the lights down low, boots on the floor
If you want a little more I got money in my pocket
Go on, let yourself go, feel the banjo
Well you might find love,
Or maybe just a good time.
But you won't know baby till you get out the house
Get a little drinky drink and turn it up loud
Tequila, a little salt, a little lime
They say you can't a drown a broken heart but guess what,
You can damn sure try.
Don't you wanna try, babe?"
"Away in a manger no crib for a bed the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
Be near me Lord Jesus I ask Thee to stay close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with Thee there
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at thy birth"
"(Dolly Parton)
Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides
But sometimes when you're riding free
You'll pay the highest price
On back roads and in back seats
And in a cheap highway motel
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
When I walked into the parlour here
Other pieces seemed to fit
I was good at pleasing strangers
So I made the most of it
Either way it's all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
And lay your cards upon the table
Do all the dealing from the top
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way"
"I fell in love on a moonlit night in the blue moon light of old Mexicali
I kissed red lips neath the blossoms of white in the blue moon light and I was so happy
Because I was happy I broke the vows I made to another
And I made promises I couldn't keep
Now I'm alone in the silent night and as blue moon light touches my pillow I weep
I weep for the heart that I've broken apart and the shame in my soul never die
For I promised that I'd be returning but I knew I was saying goodbye
For I wasn't free God forgive me only he knows what I feel inside
Because I was happy..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Fly away from my window little blue bird
Fly as far as you can away from here
And let not your song fall upon my ear
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears
For the one that I have loved
He has left me and gone
An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song
Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here
Oh, trouble me not
Go ye elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears
For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away
An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today"
"MINISTER

Sta...
Sta...
Here...
There it is...
Star of wonder star so bright
This one wish I wish tonight
If I'm to live till morning's light
Please don't serve beans on Christmas night
Cook up a steak or toss some greens
But don't bake those powerful beans
Cause if I take one single bite
We won't have a silent night
And my poor dog will howl and bay
And pray that foul bouquet
Will go away
Though he will know from whence it came
I hope it's him my guests will blame
So don't serve beans
Please don't serve beans
Cook up a steak or toss some greens
If I'm to live till morning's light
Please don't serve beans on Christmas night
CTJ
Uh thank you.
Thank you so much
I appreciate it
Thank you
Mmm huh thank you."
"I might have done it this time
I might have crossed that line
I said some things
She said some things
That we can't take back
She jumped into her car
Probably down at some uptown bar
I didn't think she'd take it this far
Now I'm sitting here waiting all alone in the dark
Let her roam
Let her run
Let her find herself
Have her fun be someone that she ain't been yet
Everybody needs space and time alone
God bring her back home
Don't let her be gone [x2]
Didn't mean the words I said
Should've held her close instead
Been the man that I ain't been yet
Give me one more chance and I'll do the rest
Let her roam
Let her run
Let her find herself
Have her fun be someone that she ain't been yet
Everybody needs space and time alone
God bring her back home
Don't let her be gone [x2]
Let her roam
Let her run
Let her find herself
Have her fun be someone that she ain't been yet
Everybody needs space and time alone
God bring her back home
Let her roam
Let her run
Let her find herself
Have her fun be someone that she ain't been yet
Everybody needs space and time alone
God bring her back home
Don't let her be gone
Don't let her be gone
Don't let her be gone
Please don't let her be gone
Don't let her be gone [x3]"
"(I want you I need you I love you please grant me this)
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If you give me a chance to love you one more time
Maybe my lips on yours would change your mind
And you would know how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this
One kiss for old time's sake just like it used to be
One kiss for old time's sake could bring you back to me
If there's a spark of love still left from our romance
You owed it to your heart to give me one more chance
Oh can't you see how much I want you I need you I love you
Oh my darling please grant me this"
"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight, yeah
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
Oh and have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow
Oh and have yourself a merry little Christmas now
A merry little Christmas now
Come on sing it with me
Oh merry little Christmas
Little Christmas
Merry little Christmas
Little Christmas
Merry little Christmas
Little Christmas
Merry little Christmas"
"In my memory I will always see
the town that I have loved so well
Where our school played ball by the gasyard wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell
Going home in the rain, running up the dark lane
past the jail and down behind the fountain
Those were happy days in so many, many ways
in the town I loved so well
In the early morning the shirt factory horn
called women from Creggan, the Moor and the Bog
While the men on the dole played a mother's role,
fed the children and then trained the dogs
And when times got tough there was just about enough
But they saw it through without complaining
For deep inside was a burning pride
in the town I loved so well
There was music there in the Derry air
like a language that we all could understand
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
And I played in a small pick-up band
There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth
I was sad to leave it all behind me
For I learned about life and I'd found a wife
in the town I loved so well
But when I returned how my eyes have burned
to see how a town could be brought to its knees
By the armoured cars and the bombed out bars
and the gas that hangs on to every tree
Now the army's installed by that old gasyard wall
and the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
With their tanks and their guns, oh my God, what have they done
to the town I loved so well"
"Some glad morning when this life is o'er I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
When the shadows of this life had flown I'll fly away
To see my loved ones that have done gone all I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never ends I'll fly away
Oh I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away
I'll fly away oh Glory I'll fly away when I'll die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away"
"I remember hearing LeAnn Rimes
When she sang blue what sounded like Patsy Cline
And I remember that Oo SheDaisy
But don't they sound a lot like Destiny's Child
Now Michael Bolton's on the Opry
And they've turned me down again
And man that really hurts me a lot
'Cause I was country when country wasn't pop
I remember ""He Stopped Loving Her Today""
Back when radio would play George Jones
You never hear Family Tradition
Or all of those killer songs Bocephus wrote
And I ain't heard twin fiddlin' since I don't know when
Now it's more like Britney Spears than it is Loretter Lynn
I was country when country wasn't pop
Yeah I was country when country wasn't pop
Yeah I was country way before Kid Rock
Now every act sounds the same
This crossin' over's got to stop
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't pop
Well they sound like Smashing Pumpkins
In a pair of cowboy boots
They's about as country as Huey Lewis and the News
I was country when country wasn't pop
Yeah...I was country when country when country wasn't pop
I was country and I'm still proud of David Baugh"
"It's been many months dear since we've parted
And not one word have I heard from you
I'm so all alone and broken hearted and I wonder if you miss me too
When the world has turned you down dear I'll be waiting
When your friends can't be found I'll be there
When your heart is sad and weary and no longer wants to roam
When you have no place to go please come on home
Darling I don't know just why you left me but I know my heart is broke in two
And if someday you should beside you want me remember I'll be waiting here for you
When the world has turned you down...
Dear if I had failed you then I'm sorry for I didn't mean to treat you wrong
If you should need me some sad tomorrow you will always find me here at home
When the world has turned you down..."
"Take that night train to Memphis take that night train to Memphis
When you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I'll be shouting hallelujah all the day
Oh we'll have a jubilee down in Memphis Tennessee

"Whiskey can't sing and whiskey can't write
If it could I'd be singin' my song on some big ole stage tonight
I had it all but I lost everything
Here I sit in this honky tonk livin' proof that whiskey can't sing
I was well on my way to bein' the star that I always knew I'd be
All over the hitparade were songs sung and played by me
And I wrote 'em by the dozens I thought my pen never would run dry
Fancy cars and swimmin' pools pretty girls and I was ridin' high
But I guess I started bending my elbow more than I should
I sang a duet with Johnnie Walker Red and I said don't that sound good
Then before I could find a word to rhyme with wine
I was out of my mind all the time
My throat got too wet my pen got too dry and my music died on the vine
Cause whiskey can't sing..."
"I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart"
"I CAN MAKE IT WITH YOU
WITH THE POZO-SECO SINGERS
WRITER CHIP TAYLOR
When the world was on my shoulders
And all hope for tomorrow was gone
You took my hand and baby you made me see
There's a future for me
And I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you
I can make it with you by my side
And when life had lost it's meaning
When my dreams had been shattered by time
You touched my hand and baby
You made me see
There's a future for me
Remember when I was down
Was lost but now I've been found
And I can make it with you, baby
I can make it with you"
"She'll poison your heart
And break down your resistance
Like the bite of a rattler
At close striking distance
She'll show you no mercy
And tear you apart
She tempts and she taunts
She flirts and flaunts
She gets what she wants
On nights when she's lonely
She'll just drop by
She won't come out and say it
But it's clear in her eye
Sometimes I hold her
And sometimes I don't
Whenever it goes
As far as I know
She gets what she wants
Oh and she"
"Yeah you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around spillin' their beer.
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say you leave your friends with mine?
Ooh, ooh, they'll be alright, ooh, I just wanna see you shine.
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
Yeah, let me see you girl.
Whatcha think about takin' that chance.
Takin' that ride, takin' my hand.
Kickin' this crowd, ditchin' this club
This nights been waitin' on us.
Ooh, ooh, lets see your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah till I get us where we're gettin' to.
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
I can see you gettin' my tailgate rockin'
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hoppin'
Bring the beat back, oh come on with me girl
Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl.
Yeah, let me see you girl.
Come on, come on, come on let me see you girl."
"What a rotten day this turned out to be
I still can't believe she'd leave so easily
She just got all her things threw em' into a pile
Then she loaded her car and said after a while
She done this before but this time she didn't cry
That's why I'm sittin on the front steps
Starin down the road, wonderin' if she'll come Back this time I don't know
After she packed
When she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking
Maybe my baby's gotten good at a goodbyes
All the times before she'd break down and cry
She'd make her threats, but her heart wasn't set on goodbye
She just wanted me to hear what she had to say
Now I'm lost for words since she went away
She may not return for this time she didn't cry
That's why I'm sittin on the front steps
Starin down the road, wonderin' if she'll come back
This time I don't know
After she packed when she looked back
There were no tears in her eyes
And that's got me worried thinking
Maybe my baby's gotten good at goodbye"

He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Canaan town the word went all around
That he turned the water into wine

Then he shouted far and wide and he calmed the raging tide
And he walked upon the Sea of Galilee

He turned the water into wine...

He healed the leper and the lame yes he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land

"I didn't see no sense in me just sittin' here and draggin' out the pain
There's nothin' you can say or do to ever make me want for you again
You say I've turned my back on you I'm runnin' out but baby that's a lie
It just don't take me long to say goodbye
I told you when I met you not to put your chain of love on me too tight
Or you'd look up and find me slipping out into the freedom of the night
I didn't mean to hurt you babe I think you know I ain't that kinda guy
But it just don't take me long to say goodbye
It just don't take me long to change my shirt and call a cab and catch a train
There ain't nothing we can talk about and baby I've got nothing to explain
All I'm taking is my body so don't ever say I left you high and dry
It just don't take me long to say goodbye it just don't take me long to say goodbye"
"My friends they told me you change like the weather
From one love to another you would go
But when I first met you your love was like the summer
Love I never dreamed of turning cold
But then the autumn leaves started falling from the trees
In your heart the season grew colder
The wind began to blow and the clouds began to snow
When your love turned from summer to winter
As the sunlight touches the face of a flower that's how soft your lips were to mine
Your love to me was just like the summer a sweeter love I knew I'd never find
But then the autumn leaves..."
"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus"
"Buddy some Topeka night
When it?s just you and the road
Seen no tailights there for miles
And nothin? much but static on the radio
Wasn?t lookin? to the left
Wasn?t lookin? to the right
Just kept walking? like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Heard my own beloved cry
I heard my one beloved moan
What?s the use in all the ache we must endure
I had no good reason why
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
Not a rail to grasp ahold
Nor a savior there beside
Juat kept a walkin? like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night
Time hangs like a noose
Before me
Time stills to a crawl
Grinds so slowly
And time hangs like a noose
Around me"
"When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home
When them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them ol' cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them ol' cotton fields back home"
"Once upon a time you dressed so fine threw the bums a dime in your prime didn't you
People'd call say you're bound to fall you thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel how does it feel with no directions home
Like a complete unknown like a rolling stone
Princess on the steeple all the pretty people drinkin' thinkin' they got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts
You'd better lift your diamond ring you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags and the language he used
Pull to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel how does it feel to be without a home
To be on your own like a complete unknown like a rolling stone just like a rolling stone"
"Five hours of football one afternoon
Three nights of poker dragging in past two
Four years of trying to make it last
Even a fool could do the math
No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you
One of seven boxes, one Uhall truck
Three brawny men a'loading it up
One thousand ""I'm sorry's"" ten minutes too late
One fed up girl on the interstate
No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you
[Instrumental Interlude]
Congratulations Einstein
Look at what you've done
You've solved the equation
For two minus one
No woman is gonna hang around
For some man who can't figure it out
Do the numbers, it all adds up to
No woman, no woman for you
No woman, no woman for you"
"She called me baby baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one night I awoke and she was gone
There's no more baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby baby all night long
She called me baby baby all night long
Build me up so high and made me strong
Now each night in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby baby all night long
I still hear baby baby all night long"
"Shotgun in my daddy's truck
Eight years old and acting tough
He smiled at me and said, ""You shift the gears""
He would search that FM dial
And I would count down every mile
Til the station out of Tulsa came in clear
It was old Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul
I'm talking about a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song
While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vernon and Alabama
I was learning bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing
I'm talking bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song"
"Everybody thinks that I walked out on her they're calling me a no good so and so
Why can I make them see that though I walked away
I didn't want to leave she made me go
What makes them think I'll give up everything I love
There's a lot of things that they don't know
I've been accused of everything she's guilty of I didn't want to leave she made me go
She told everyone I didn't want to stay but I'll tell you her story isn't so
I'd give anything if it were that way I didn't want to leave she made me go
[ fiddle ]
With her act I guess that she has fooled the town
With her phoney tips she's quite a show
My heart tells me that I'm the biggest fool around
Cause I love her though she made me go
She told everyone...
I didn't want to leave she made me go"
"The alarm clock woke my sleeping but I lay there for a minute
With a million cobwebs clinging to my brain
I stopped the bell from ringing in the times it takes a heartbeat
Then I settled back and closed my eyes again
I reached out for my baby for some early morning loving
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head
There was nothing but the fragrance of her perfume on the pillow
Baby wasn't there beside me in the bed
It's the mornin' after baby let me down
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found
Only silence to torment me no soft hands to touch me gently
It's the mornin' after baby let me down
There was nothing to hold on to except the sheets that fell around me
And I started into tremblin' like a leaf
How could that woman leave me she was more than just a lover
She was every bit a lady warm and sweet
I can taste the salty teardrops God it's gettin' hard to swallow
I hope a glass of bourbon can take the pain away
I got no appetite for eatin' just a sick and empty feelin'
What a good for nothing way to start the day
It's the mornin' after baby..."
"I got a pig at home in a pen
Corn to feed him on
All I need's a pretty little girl
To feed I'm when I'm gone
Going up on a mountain
To sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of sorghum
Sweet little Liza Jane
Black clouds arising
Sure sign of rain
Put that old gray bonnet
On little Liza Jane
Yonder comes that gal of mine
How do you think I know
Know her by that gingham gown
Hanging down so low"
"Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise, ain't no boat's a gonna row
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet and you can rock this joint
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best, friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault
But, oh, mama
Well that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's King for King, it's Queen for Queen
It's a gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
But, oh, mama
You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow"
"Duet with Ronnie Milsap
Writer Lester Flatt
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more"
"There are stars in the southern sky southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees down the seven bridges road
Now I have loved you like a baby like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way and I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me has to turn from here and go
Running like a child beneath warm stars down the seven bridges road
[ strings ]
Now there are stars in the southern sky and if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweetened honey down the seven bridges road"
"There goes that train that carried my girl from town if I known her number lord I'd flag her down.
I wish to the lord that the train would wreck, kill that engineer and breaks the fire man's neck
Chorus,
Hate the train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)
There goes my girl somebody bring her back, cause she got her hand in my money sack.
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, won't you show me a women that a man can trust.
Chorus,
Hate the train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)
Where was you when the train left town? I stand on the corner with my head hung down.
If I had a gun I let the hammer down.
Lord, I'd shoot that rambler that took my girl from town
Chorus,
Hate that train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)
Don't want no grease mixed in with my rice, that girl of mine took my appetite.
Hey rations on the table and coffee is getting cold and some dirty rambler stole my jelly roll.
Chorus,
Hate the train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)
Tennesse raised Alabama bound if my girl leaves me gonna move from town,
Hello central give me 6 0 9
I want to talk to that women of mine,
Hate the train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)...
Hate the train that carried my girl from town,
Hey (x3)"
"Pain is growing like a vine stranglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from the storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still suffocating
Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
Cause nothin's changed, nothin's changed
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel
And I can feel your love still
Suffocating"
"Christina our first born you are so soft and warm as you lie between us softly sleeping
We gaze in admiration at God's tiny creation
And thank him and ask for your safe keeping
You were conceived through love you are a part of us
Christina you are a dream come true
We'll place you in God's hands and place you in our plans
Christina we'll take good care of you
And as we watch you grow we will always let you know how much we love you Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you Christina Christina
You made our house a home brought joy we've never known Christina we love you so
With innocence sweet and fair blue eyes and angel hair
Through the years we'll watch you as you grow
We'll hold your little hand we'll love you all we can
We'll try to teach you right from wrong
You are God's gift to us we can't thank him enough"
"If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revengin in my name
One person dead from such is plenty
No need to go get locked away
When I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over ?
I'm comin' home
I wonder which brother is better
Which one our parents love the most
I sure did get in lots of trouble
They said to let the other go
A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He said I love you
And I'm proud of you both, in so many different ways
If I get murdered in the city
Go read the letter in my desk
Don't worry with all my belongings
But pay attention to the list
Make sure my sister knows I loved her
Make sure my mother knows the same
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name
Always remember, there is nothing worth sharing
Like the love that let us share our name"
"Well once upon a time
When I held you in my arms
On a blanket in the grass
Where we'd watch the falling stars
Under that old maple tree
We'd share secrets in the dark
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
In Mackenzie Park
(Chorus)
And we lived, laughed, and loved as if
There were no tomorrow
Up until the day you went away
Leaving only sorrow
Now the stars don't shine
The way they used to do
Like they did when you were mine
Perhaps they're lonely too
You can barely read the names
That I carved inside a heart
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
In Mackenzie Park
(Chorus)
Sometimes I think of you
And I just have to smile
Though forever never was
At least we had a little while
How time flies when you're young
Just like the flicker of a spark
Now I sit here all alone
Watching children play
In Mackenzie Park"
"While walkin' one day in the country
I saw a gatherin' crowd
And as my footsteps drew me closer
I could smell the sweet fragrance of flowers
It look like a family reunion
Had my eyes not counted the tears
And an old man sat by a graveside
I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven't seen Mary in years
When Mary and I were first married
We had such plans for our child
But for no reason I started ramblin'
Like the four winds I just ran wild
If I could live our life over
I'd bring Mary such cheer
Now she's gone where she'll never meet me
I haven't seen Mary in years
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead me away from here
I just brought these flowers for Mary
I haven't seen Mary in years
Then the old man left the graveyard
I walked along by his side
I called out his name but through all his shame
His son, he did not recognize
Hold my hand and lead me
Lead you away from here
How could I know it was Mama
I haven't seen Mama in years"
"If you need a prison break
I will be the file in the cake
We will make a great escape
Into the wild blue yonder
If you need to chase the blues
I will be your running shoes
We'll double back and leave no clues
Into the wild blue yonder
Into the wild blue yonder
Where we can be free
Into the wild blue yonder
I'm takin' you with me
If you need to fight for love
I will be your boxing gloves
Cheering crowds will lift us up
Into the wild blue yonder
Into the wild blue yonder
Where we can be free
Into the wild blue yonder
I'm takin' you with me
If you need someone to care
If life is treating you unfair
Take my love I'll lead you there
Into the wild blue yonder
Into the wild blue yonder"
"I was born in East Virginia North Carolina I did go
There I met the fairest maiden her name and age I did not know
Her hair it was a light brown color her lips they were red ruby's red
On her breast she wore white lilie there I longed to lay my head
I was born in East Virginia...
I'd rather be in some dark holler where the sun don't never shine
Than to know she loved another and to know she'd never be mine
I was born in East Virginia...
Her name and age I did not know"
"As I went now for to take a little walk,
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a'walkin' and a'talkin' by my true lover's side
And I bid him to leave her alone
He said my age is 21, too old to be controlled
I pulled my revolver from my side,
And I destroyed that poor boy's soul
He reeled and he staggered and he fell to the ground
And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl's neck,
Sayin' ???Honey won't ya take me home????
So put them handcuffs on me boys,
And lead me to that freight-car gate
I have no friends or relations there,
No one for to go my bail"
"Back about eighteen hundred and some a Louisiana couple had a red headed son
No name soothe him Jim Jack or Joe they just called him Billy Bayou
Billy Billy Bayou watch where you go you're walkin' on quick sand and walk slow
Billy Billy Bayou watch what you say a pretty girl'll get you one of these days
Billy was a boy kinda big for a size red hair and freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn
Billy Billy Bayou...
One said day Billy cried ho-ho I can whip the feathers of Geronimo
He smarted off the chief got mad this nearly ended our Louisiana lad
Billy Billy Bayou...
One day in eighteen-seventy-eight a pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there and run
He would up married cause he did neighter one
Billy Billy Bayou...
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days"
"If my years were less if my shoes were new I'd pack my things and I'd leave you
Hitch myself to some westbound train you'd never see me again
If I could dream as I once could I'd be gone it'd good
I don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
We once had love but it's gone now don't know when don't know how
We're two strangers under one roof no need to lie that's the truth
Love has gone there's nothing left I wanna leave can't help myself
Don't want to live have never try in some old house where love has died
Too many ghosts walk the floor ghosts of the love that ain't no more
I'd like to have what we once had ain't no way that's too bad
Cause you're too much a part of me for me to be ever free
So we'll keep living and neither tryin' in some old house where love has died"
"There's a candle in the corner
It keeps reminding me of you
It's how you lit it on my birthday
Sometimes I miss the things you do
But then you'd turn on me if the wind blew
And you'd sting me with a glare
And your thirst was so insatiable
Just to quench it robbed me bare
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
Cross-legged by the fireplace
I play guitar while you read
My patience ran so thin with you
Always toying with my head
Some how it made you strangely gleeful
To see me longing for your touch
And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay
C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away
If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain
C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain
And I fall on my knees
All my pride is in your hands
We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans
I taste the shame and I'll take the blame
If it's my cross to bear
I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees"
"Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'Cause I think I'm gonna win
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me, no
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, the Queen of Spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of Hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is which
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well, I spend all night with the dealer
Trying to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Trying to get out of bed
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me"
"I'll take my chances with you now and forever with you
There may be times you hurt me as only you can do
But I'll take my chances with you
I'll do my dreaming with you dreaming together with you
There may be times it seems our dreams won't come true
But I'll take my chances with you
[ guitar ]
There may be times it seems our dreams won't come true
But I'll take my chances with you I'll take my chances with you"
"No chocolate in the duty free shop
Two drops of scotch
Gonna end up on his crotch, tonight
All alone, sitting on the throne
Some native tongue on the TV
Blaring like an old Peavey
He don't aim to be rude
He's fighting with his inner prude
Some pommes frites and you know
It's gonna drip on to his lap
Yes, see the man slapping it off
Travellin' will do him in
Trudging through the waves of people
'till his heart is cluttered and feeble
If you take him out of this loop
He may be very easily duped
Still he beats the stampede for the duty free"
"Well I never felt nothing like I did tonight
You had the face of a boy that I met in a dream one time
Some heard it thunder and so did I
I swear it happened when your eyes met mine
Maybe it was just the way the wind blew
Maybe it was God and his son too
But in that moment I know that I knew that I,
I found you
I saw a light I,
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here, mine all mine well
I saw a light I, saw a light
Well I still can't believe someone left you laying around
Something precious like you should have already been found
What if I'd stayed home and done nothing tonight
What if you had looked left and I had looked right
For once in our lives we were both on time and now
I found you
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here,
Mine all mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
Somebody told me
When I was younger
Chance is like lightning
Love is like thunder
So I walked right over
Asked for your number
'Cause somebody told me when I was younger
I saw a light I
Heard a bell
You were the very best feeling, that I ever felt
And suddenly you are standing here before my eyes
The thunder in my heart it tells me, you are mine well
I saw a light I
Saw
A light"
"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone"
"Here we are again going in this cheap place
What if was seen by a friend and they recognize our face
We both know that it's wrong we both should be at home
This time has gotta be our last time
I know that you want me just as much as I want you
You've got a family and I've got one too
From now on we must stay apart we just can't break all their hearts
This time has gotta be our last time
This time has gotta be our last time we'll put our rings that own our hands
Your conscience hurt you well mine does too
I'm not this kind of woman and I'm not this kind of man
We just can't go on cheating neither of us is this kind
This time has gotta be our last time this time has gotta be our last time"
"Something More Besides You
One foot stands before the crib
The other by the casket.
A question formed upon stilled lips
Is passed on but never asked.
I guess I believe that there's a point
In what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
Two are born to cross
Their paths, their lives, their hearts.
If by chance one turns away
Are they forever lost?
I guess I believe that there's a point
To what we do.
But I ask myself is there
Something more besides you?
This morning I awoke,
The bed warm where it once was cold.
Small blessings laid upon us.
Small mysteries slowly unfold.
Yet I still wonder is there a point
To what we do?
'Cause I kind of doubt
That there is something more besides you.
Although it's hard to find the point
To what we do,
Do I dare believe that there is
Something more besides you?"
"I woke up this mornin' and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again
I fought it like the devil, but you know that you're in trouble
When you're fourteen and drunk by ten a.m.
Tried to hide it from my mom and dad, all my friends said, straighten up
I just laughed, said, you don't understand
That's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
At sixteen I was on my own and flyin' high
And stayin' stoned
I knew everything there was to know
I did things that I can't talk about
I wore my mom and daddy out
Late nights they spent prayin' for my soul
Stayed sober once for nine days in a row
I quit cold turkey and damn near almost
Made it to ten
But that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
'Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
I don't know when or where it was or how we met
And fell in love
Or why she'd even fall for a guy like me
I tried to pull myself together, hopin' we could last forever
For awhile I started to believe
Her daddy said, she's all I got
Son, don't ever break her heart
Promise me before you take her hand
But that's just too much to ask of a drinkin' man
I look into the mirror, bottle in my hand
I'd like to pour it out, I just don't think I can
'Cause that's a hell of a lot to ask of a drinkin' man
I woke up this mornin' and I swore to God
I'd never, ever take another drink again"
"(Gordon Kennedy/Wayne Kirkpatrick/Tommy Simms)
It don't matter to the sun
If you go or if you stay
I know the sun is gonna rise
Shine down on another day
There will still be a tomorrow
Even if you choose to leave
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)
It matters to me
It ain't gonna stop the world
If you walk out that door
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)
Like it did the day before
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)
It just keeps on keepin' time
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)
But it'll be the end of mine
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you...
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah
What can I say
What can I do
I'm still in love
So without you
It don't matter the moon
If your not in my life
No the moon will just keep hangin' 'round (hangin' 'round)
Like it's just another night
Find another place to shine on down
On some other lovers dreams
'Cause it don't matter the moon (oh baby)
But is sure do matter to me
No it don't matter to the moon (oh baby)
But it matters to me"
"The wind is blowing, through the pines
Always stealing from me, Father Time
Taking from me, what was never mine
One more day, one more night
Always longing for the past
Taking for granted, the time at hand
Every moment like shifting sand
Leaving weary, the strongest man
Many fortunes have been gained and lost
Upon the ocean, many ships have crossed
Many brilliant souls have lived and died
At the hands of Father Time
I'm not promised another day
Still I'm reckless and time I waste
All my tears cried in vain
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades
Gaining wisdom as beauty fades"
"Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again
I know that the neighbours are all a-talkin'
They swear that I have lost my mind
Ah but they do not know
That I've just gained control
Of all the heartache that you left behind
Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again
Well I know that the boss is gonna fire me
When I stumble in late to work again
But surprise will replace that old scowl on his face
When he sees that I do not give a damn
Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin'
Since I started drinkin'
Since I started drinkin' again"
"Holdin' on, safely to fall
Like there's no tomorrow forsaking it all
Bound and determined to share all of our days
Loving and learning our special ways
That I'm holdin' onto and you've been lettin' go
And wherever you've gone to
I'm so far below
You're way over me
I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now
Movin' on, heart in a stall
Like there's no tomorrow
No beating at all
Bound and determined to forget all of our days
Reliving and learning our special ways
I'm still holdin' onto
Maybe no lettin' go
And wherever you've gone to
I may never know
The way you're over me
I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now
And you don't need me now
Like you needed me then
And I'm wondering how I'll be feeling when
I'm way over you
I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now
No way I'll need you the way you don't need me now."
"THAT'S NOT HER PICTURE
(Bill Anderson - Gary Burr)
'00 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY JOHN MICHAEL MONTGOMERY
That's not her picture I wish it was
It came with the wallet I keep it because
It reminds me of her it reminds me of us
That's not her picture
I haven't replaced it I don't know why
It may be the blonde hair it may be the smile
It brings back the feeling for a little while
That's not her picture
I know it's wrong it's a total stranger
A photo from the discount store
Her picture's home in a thousand pieces
Scattered on the bedroom floor
She might have her eyes might have her face
Might look like her in so many ways
It fools the heart it fills the space
That's not her picture
I know it's wrong it's a total stranger...
That's not her picture I wish it was...
Oh thank you for asking I miss her so much
But that's not her picture"
"Faded pictures, yellow from time.
Well worn memories of days gone by.
Needing someone and nobody's there.
These are the things broken dreams are made of, Lord they're everywhere.
Tears of the lonely keep falling all the time, tears of the lonely never dry.
Another nightime that just never ends.
A helpless longing for what might have been.
Another morning to face all alone.
These are the things broken dreams are made of, they go on and on.
Tears of the lonely keep falling all the time, tears of the lonely never dry.
Tears of the lonely keep falling all the time, tears of the lonely never dry."
"I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll win you over, over and over again
I'm getting closer, closer than I've ever been
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
Gotta find a way to get to your heart to sweep you off your feet
I'll wrap you up in my love, cover you with kisses so sweet
I gotta get to you 'cause you're sure been getting to me
I'll keep on trying, trying and I'll never give up
I would be lying if I said we were close enough"
"WARNING..! The song is called NEW black rich, not MEW..!!
I'll say goodbye before we meet
I'll have to say goodbye before we meet
It's not who I am, it's who I'll never be
I'll have to throw out the mirror
And head into the trees
And if the world were more beautiful
Then you would be
If the world were more beautiful
Then you would be
So I'll say goodbye before we meet
So I'll say goodbye before we meet"
"I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city, where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one, that's silver lined
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we'll never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold
Though often tempted, tormented and tempted
And like the prophet my pillow is stone
And though I find here no permanent dwelling
I know he'll give me a mansion my own
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we'll never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold
Don't think me poor Lord, deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged, 'cause I'm heaven bound
I'm just a pilgrim in search of a city
I want a mansion, a harp, and a crown
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder, we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold"
"Have you ever, felt the sting of a broken heart?
Were you watching, while your whole world fell apart?
Have you wondered, how things might have been?
But aint it funny?
When loves comes back again
Have you mastered,
The art of looking strong?
When you're dying, but you never let it show
Have you pretended, you're the best you've ever been?
But aint it funny?
When love comes back again
Chorus: All those nights you spent alone
With the moonlight climbing in
Many days of feeling low
Then suddenly, you're standing tall when love comes back again
Have you ever lost your faith of finding love?
and have you questioned, the reasons from above?
Were you aching, watching strangers holding hands?
But aint it funny?
When you find love again"
"[ Jimmy Gateley ]
Sweet sweet lovin' warms my heart inside sweet sweet lovin' keeps me satisfied
I touch Heaven when your arms reach to hold me tight
You give me sweet sweet lovin' every night sweet lovin' every night"
"(You're treating me wrong you're breaking my heart)
The clothes that I wear are shabby and old but I'll never spend your silver and gold
Each night I'm alone we're drifting apart
You're treating me wrong you're breaking my heart
You've shattered my hopes my dreams are all gone my life is so bare how can I go on
You never will change it's too late to start
You're treating me wrong you're breaking my heart
[ piano ]
Once I was free the one in your dreams
But now that I'm yours you forgot me it seems
The things you have done have torn us apart
You're treating me wrong you're breaking my heart"
"Well I'll gladly take ten seconds in the saddle
For a lifetime of watching from the stands
[ guitar ]
His Stetson was faded and battered and worn
The stubble of his beard showed flex of gray
His limp was severe cause a leg had been torn by a bronc in his rodeo days
He hung round the chutes while we waited to mount
With a vague look of longing in his eyes
He spoke very few words but he made 'em count
He was broken forgotten but wise
He said life's is just like ridin' broncs its a battle
Then he rolled a cigarette with shaky hands
Son I'll gladly take ten seconds in the saddle
For a lifetime of watching from the stands
[ guitar ]
I noticed the cigarette burns on his vest
And the rembrandt of a dream left in his eyes
The boys said he could have well been the best
Had not fate cheated him of his prize
Oh but I learned a lesson that I'd never known
From this guy who'd been busted so bad
It's better to ride even if you get throwed
Than to wind up just wishing you had
He said life's is just like...
Yes I'll gladly take ten seconds in the saddle
For a lifetime of watching from the stands"
"The only way out is to walk over me
So you found someone else and you're going to leave
Did she tell you I don't love you did you really believe
On the floor by the door I'll be down on my knees
Cause the only way out is to walk over me
You don't hear and you don't feel but I know you can see
Just to prove that I love you I'll crawl at your feet
Just look down at the ground where your footprints will be
Cause the only way out is to walk over me
You have put me just as low as anyone ought to go
But I lay down beside what's left of my pride
If you go then you'll know cause you can't help but see
That the only way out is to walk over me
You have put me just as low...
Yes the only way out is to walk over me"
"Oh the games people now every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now and never sayin' what they mean
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
Until they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine
Lotten da da da da lotten da da a dee da dee
Yes we're talkin' bout you and me and the games people play
Make one another cry break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die that the other one's to blame
But neither one will ever give in so we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been and it's a dirty rotten shame
Lotten da da da da...
Your friends're walkin' up to ya singing glory hallelujah
As they're tryin' to sock it to ya in the name of the Lord
They're gonna teach you how to meditate read your horoscope and cheat your fate
And furthermore to hell with hate come on and get on board
Lotten da da da da...
Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me
God grand me the serenity to just remember who I am
Cause we've given up our sanity for our kind and our vanity
Turn our back on humanity and we don't give a lot
Lotten da da da da...
Yes we're talkin' bout you and me and the games people play"
"(Leonard Cohen)
Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away
She'll walk 'til she finds him her darlin' her stray
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss
And there's nothin' to follow nowhere to go
He's gone like the summer gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong
Did she dream it was he who went galloping past
And bent down the fern broke open the grass
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth
And although he goes grazin' a minute away
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day
And she's blind to his presence except to compare
Her injury here with his punishment there
Then at home on a branch on a high stream
A songbird sings out so suddenly
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride
On a willow tree by the riverside
An the world is sweet and world is wide
And he's there where the light and the darkness divide
And the steam's comin' off him he's huge and he's shy
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky
And he comes to her hand but he's nor really tame
He longs to be lost she longs for the same
And he'll bolt and he'll plunge thru the first open pass
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass
Or he'll make a break for the high plateau
Where there's nothing above and noting below
It's time for their burden the whip and the spur
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her
So she binds herself to her galloping steed
And he binds himself to the woman in need
And there is no space just left and right
And there is no time but there is day and night
Then she learns on his neck and whispers low
Whither thou goest I will go
And they turn as one the head for the plain
No need for the whip oh no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight
Who snaps it asunder the very next night
Some say it's him some say it's her
Some say love's like smoke beyond all repair
So my darlin' my darlin' just let go by
That old silhouette on the great western sky
And I'll pick out a tune and they'll move right along
And they're gone like smoke and they're gone like this song
Say a prayer for the cowgirl"
"When I saw you buyin' Cosmo and a Hot Rod magazine
I said to myself now there's a girl for me
And when I asked you to go for a ride
You stole my heart when you said if I can drive
I said how bout some music you said you got any Merle
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
And when we started talking I could not believe my ears
You said you were a Braves fan even through the rotten years
You quoted William Faulkner and Martin Luther King
You said your favorite movie star would always be James Dean
And when we went to dinner you wore blue jeans with your pearls
That's when I knew you were my kind of girl
You march to the beat of a different drum
The funny thing is that I hear the same one
We both like to color outside of the lines
We're peas in a pod girl we're two of a kind
Yeah you march to the beat of a different drum
I said I think I love you you said what's not to love
I thought about a kiss but I wasn't quick enough
I guess while I was thinkin' you were readin' my mind
Cause you wrapped your arms around me and you pressed your lips to mine"
"I woke up this morning
For the first time in a long time
I felt alright
I didn't dream about you
Like I dreamed about you
All those lonely nights
I poured myself some coffee
Left your cup on the shelf
I'mf finally feeling all right
With being by myself
I'm healing
I'm gettin' over you
I'm dealing
With all you put me through
Slowly a new me's appearing
Oh I'm healing
I finally got the nerve up
To take down all those pictures
And not fall apart
There I finally did it
Oh heart, go on admit
That wasn't so hard
I sat down and read the funnies
Peanuts made me laugh
One of life's little pleasures
But it's simple things like that
That's got me
I'm healing
I'm gettin' over you
I'm dealing
With all you put me through
Slowly a new me's appearing
Oh I'm healing"
"You have gone and yet I'm still your prisoner
although you're with your new love I'm not free
For you have placed a lock around my heart dear and you are the keeper of the key
Love locked inside like mine burns constantly so darling please come back to me
We'll lock our hearts together for a lifetime and God will be the keeper of the key
[ steel ]
Only you can break the chains that bind me only you can end my misery
No one else can dry the tears that blind me for you are the keeper of the key
Love locked inside like mine..."
"The walls that surround us are slowly crumblin' down
But the heart of this foundation is still on solid ground
Just need some renovation and a lot of TLC
And a long night of lovin' is all that we both need
So roll the shades down
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone
If the door bell rings
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house
It just needs a little home improvement
Every day we go our separate ways
To make our dreams come true
But it ain't worth the sacrifice
If we're giving up me and you
We gotta hold on tighter than tight
To the lies that make us strong
And get back to the roots
That made this house a home
So roll the shades down
Lock the doors up tight, turn on the code-a-phone
If the door bell rings
We'll just stay in bed and pretend nobody's home
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house
It just needs a little home improvement"
"I was the one
Who was undone till you picked me up
So, how did you fall so far from it all?
Thought you were my rock
So, why do you push me away?
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
Listen to me, I can't compete with this trip you're on
And if you decide to take that ride, I won't come along
'Cause I know just where it leads
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
I know you're scared and you just wanna run
'Cause I've been there
I know where you're coming from
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you go down
I love you too much, no, I won't let you drown
And it just comes with being the man that I am
So forgive me, forgive me for giving a damn
Forgive me for giving a damn"
"Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Ain't been no lovin' since you been gone
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, tell the world I do"
"Hey pretty baby are you ready for me
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
Well I'm just outta Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on
There's a speed trap up ahead South of town
But no local yokel's gonna shut me down
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from the guitar town
Nothin' ever happened round my home town
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you can't get far
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the guitar town
Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
Love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant, wonderin' why I don't stop
Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards it's a brand new hand
Put my back to the risers and make my stand
Hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And I'll take you back with me to the guitar town"
"Waterloo Waterloo where will you meet your Waterloo
Every puppy has his day everybody has to pay everybody has to meet his Waterloo
Now ol' Adam was the first in history with an apple he was tempted and deceived
Just for spite the devil made him take a bite
And that's where ol' Adam met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Little General Napoleon of France tried to conquer the world but lost his pants
Met defeat known as Bonaparte's reterat and that's where Napoleon met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo...
Now a feller who's darling proved untrue took her life but he lost his too
Now he swings where the little birdie sings
And that's where Tom Dooley met his Waterloo
Waterloo Waterloo..."
"There's an old Kodak camera in my dresser drawer
I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realize that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did I think it was with you
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy just to think
That it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Standin' there, I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must've been at least three years ago
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine
And somewhere in my closet
There's a cardboard box just sittin' on the shelf
It's full of faded memories
And it's been there ever since the night you left
Just forgotten photographs
To remind me of the past
But I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Yeah, who needs pictures with a memory like mine"
"Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standing up
For what he thought was right
He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
Now we might have been better off or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backing down
But we always had plenty just living his advice
Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight
He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
Now I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's days
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything."
"Here comes old life of the party Charlie he's a funny funny man
And every party Charlie is the life
Everyone's in love with the life of the party Charlie settin' me
And I love Charlie's wife
Everytime there's party old Charlie always there
Cuttin' up and acting like a clown
Whenever there's a party you won't find me there
I'll bee out with Charlie's wife on the other side of town
Here comes old life of the party...
If you're gonna throw a party have old Charlie come around
He's a lot of fun so he won't mind
But don't bother asking me I'll be busy as can be
With the swinging little party that Charlie leave behind
Here comes old life of the party...
Here comes old life of the party..."
"Bowling Green is the perfect place for girls to meet boys
Don't go skipping around
Where you're not invited
The man knows how to dress
Seen him in the Wall Street press
He's a toastable philanthropist
He's the chair of the company
He takes you to Palm beach
and now your wedding's arranged
The Royal hawaiian hotel
Billions in charities
Now your mothers in tears
Pacing through the kitchen hears
Your name on the Fox Five news
and a fraud investigation
Turn on the tv, its your daughter Mrs. Kain
Turn on the tv, its your daughter Mrs. Kain
How could it end this way, never could tell
at the royal hawaiian hotel
Panama all the way to Anaheim
that's where the Giants sleep
A boy in a Bentley
A party of the political elite
Posing on the tenth hole green
Hungry for a photograph with the man of a century
Turn on the tv, it's your daughter Mr. Kain
Turn on the tv, it's your daughter Mrs. Kain
how could it end this way, never could tell
at the royal hawaiian hotel
Why did it end this way
How did it end this way, Mr Kain
How did it end this way
How did it end this way, Mr. Kain
How did it end this way, Mr. Kain
How did it end this way, Mr. Kain"
"Way up in the sky, not a cloud is flyin' by
A picture perfect afternoon
Birds upon the wing, I can hear them sing
Chirping out a happy tune
And I'm walkin' around with my head hanging down
Got a reason for feeling this way
Since you've been gone things look so wrong
The sky's got the blues today
The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you
That old sky's got the blues and I've got nothing to look up to
Yeah, the sky's got the blues, the sky's got the blues today
Everyone I see, happy as can be
Loving all this warm sunshine
So many things to do, beneath a sky of blue
Not a worry on their minds
Oh but I could stand a change, some clouds or some rain
Now ain't that sad to say, but it could take a turn
As far as I'm concerned, the sky's got the blues today
The sky's got the blues, just like I've got them for you
That old sky's got the blues and I've got nothing to look up to
Yeah, the sky's got the blues, the sky's got the blues today
Yeah, the sky's got the blues today"
"I can see you got your eye on this old cowboy
And I can tell you've never had one for your own
Or you've never been around one
Now you're thinkin' that you've found one
Well it might be kinda fun to take him home
You giggle every time that I say yes ma'am
And I get this feelin' if I held you tight
You'd be seein' his and hers
Buckles boots and spurs
But that's a feelin' you'll get over overnight
'Cause what'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead of getttin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says honey
I've got half a mind to stay
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away
You can see it takes a special kinda woman
To put up with the life a cowboy leads
'Cause his boots are always muddy
And his beer drinkin' buddies
They'll camp out on your couch and never leave
Don't even start to think you're gonna change him
You'd be better off to try and rope the wind
What he see is what he's got
And he can't be what he's not
And honey you can't hide him from your friends
'Cause what'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead of getttin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says honey
I've got half a mind to stay
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away
What'cha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away"
"When my baby left me she left trouble all around
She left a tangle in mind and a tear in my eye and my heart was sorrow bound
But when I woke up this morning I brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Then I looked all around for a little tear but the little tear wasn't there
Now I can walk in the sunshine again now I can hold my head up high
Now I can walk like the man I have been now I can live again
[ steel ]
I've spent some long nights thinking I guess I did some drinking too
I've cried at least the million tears and I had my share of the blues
But today it's finally over the world looks brighter to me now
I'm still here and she's still gone but it's all right somehow
Now I can walk in the sunshine again now I can hold my head up high
So I'll say goodbye to my drinking friends now I can live again now I can give again"
