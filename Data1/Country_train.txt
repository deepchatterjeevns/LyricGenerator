"When The Morning Sun Streaks Across My Room
And I'm Waken Up From Another Dream Of You
When I'm On The Road, Once Again It Seems
All that's Left Behind, Is A Chain Of Broken Dreams
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh.... I Love You....
How I Wish That Love, was all We Need To Live
What A Life We'd Have, Cause I've Got So Much To Give
But It Seems So Wrong, Deep Inside My Heart
That The Dollar Sign Should Be Keeping Us Apart
But You Know I Love
Yes I Love You.....Ohhh I Love You
And If Only I Could Find My Way Back To The Time
When The Problems Of This Life it Did not Cross your Minds
And All The Answers could be Found In Children's Nursery Rhymes
And I'd Come Running Back To You, I'd Come Running Back To You
But You Know We Can't Live On Dreams Alone
And To Pay The Rent, I Must Leave You All Alone
And Though I Made My Choice Many Years Ago
And now This Traveling Life Is The Only One I Know
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You
But You Know I Love You
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You..."
"Well, it really has been nice bein' with you
But I'm afraid that I've got to leave
As you know I'm a rodeo cowboy
And there's a rodeo down in Mesquite
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy, breakin' broncs or gettin' broke
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy and that's the only life I know
On the day you think your day is the big one
I'm walkin' away with all that they own
Then you're lyin', hurtin', hearin' someone saying
Give him a hand that's all that cowboy is taking home
Hot beer and cold stale hamburgers
Makes a meal sorta hard to enjoy
And it kinda makes you think of momma's chicken
Ah, that's the life of a rodeo cowboy
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy
When you're down and you're really feeling sorry
Well, you go for a drink in some bar
Then someone points at you
And you hear him whisper over there stands a rodeo star
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy
That's the life of a rodeo cowboy"
"The sun comes up and brings the dawn as usual
And I awake I'll find you're gone as usual
But I can't find a way to let this crazy heart of mine forget
I pretend you're still beside me as usual
Each evening I take a walk as usual
I make believe that we still talk as usual
People always stop and stare I guess they just don't see you there
Don't they know you'll always be right here as usual
Today I looked into my mirror as usual
I told myself that you're still here as usual
And as I stood there telling lies the tears began to fill my eyes
Cause I know I'm only fooling myself as usual"
"I'm a believer,
There's a song in me that's begging to be heard.
Yes, I'm a dreamer,
Hanging on to hope for everything it's worth,
So I skipped a few meals and I slept in my car,
When you're down that road,
They don't care who you are
Oh, look at me now,
I'm still here, standing strong,
Giving it my all,
'Cause that's just who I am
I won't give up
I don't know what that means
It's not inside of me."
"I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?
There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.
I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere, only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires"
"Baby, what do you say when love comes down on you
Rainin' the blues on you
Like it's never gonna end on you
And all yourdreams like leaves in the gutter go floatin' by
No, baby, I don't know why all God's children cry
I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
And where you go I hope you find out there
A better rain
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
And lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rain
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
Long after time has erased
All the words like razor blades
You'll remember you and me before the flood
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us
I can see you on some stretch of sand
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in
A better rain
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky
Lets you know that God's alive
A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again
In a better rain"
"In my memory I will always see
the town that I have loved so well
Where our school played ball by the gasyard wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell
Going home in the rain, running up the dark lane
past the jail and down behind the fountain
Those were happy days in so many, many ways
in the town I loved so well
In the early morning the shirt factory horn
called women from Creggan, the Moor and the Bog
While the men on the dole played a mother's role,
fed the children and then trained the dogs
And when times got tough there was just about enough
But they saw it through without complaining
For deep inside was a burning pride
in the town I loved so well
There was music there in the Derry air
like a language that we all could understand
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
And I played in a small pick-up band
There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth
I was sad to leave it all behind me
For I learned about life and I'd found a wife
in the town I loved so well
But when I returned how my eyes have burned
to see how a town could be brought to its knees
By the armoured cars and the bombed out bars
and the gas that hangs on to every tree
Now the army's installed by that old gasyard wall
and the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
With their tanks and their guns, oh my God, what have they done
to the town I loved so well"
"She knows who I am she knows what I do I'm a high rolling dreamer that never comes through but she won't criticize and she does'nt complaign she hides all the hurt and she lives with the pain
But I know I'm losing her one heartache at a time I see it in her eyes each time I cross another line she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time
All she wants is someone with his feet on the ground but all she's got is a jerk that keeps letting her down she knows I can't change so she does'nt get mad and when she thinks I'm not looking she looks so sad
And I know I'm losing her one heartache at a time I see it in her eyes each time I cross another line she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time
Brige Every single tear I made her cry brings her one step closer to good bye she'll say that she forgives she'll say that we'll be fine but she's falling out of love one heartache at a time she's falling out of love one heartache at a time"
"If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you"
"Back in 1953, we stole a car old Merle and me
Never thinking wed be put in jail
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen
When they put those bars between old Merle and me
Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me
We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend
Acting like wed never been in reform school
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me
We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me"
"They sent me out from Santa Fe to try and find his trail
They think that I'm the only one who can bring him back to jail
This star says I'm a lawman this gun has seen me through
And though my heart is heavy I've got a job to do
You see he's such a proud man who never learned to crawl
But a good man turns gun slinger he's the meanest man of all
He killed the US Marshall and for that he's gonna pay
And I'm the lonely lawman who's on his trail today
There was a time he fought for true and on the side of right
Until the only girl he loved was killed one faithful night
I know his heart was shattered as he turned the barren sod
And laid away her body come ending into God
Then he vowed a revenge to those who took her life
And every notch upon his gun a tear shed for his wife
But revenge is like wild fire sweepin' through the wood
It turns reason into ashes and it burns out on the good
Now I can't help but remember as I trail this lonesome man
I don't believe while we were boys out of any race we ran
For you see his face resembles mine we talk somewhat the same
And though we walk in different world we both wear our daddy's name"
"You spun that web baby, you made that bed baby
You built that brick wall that you're running into, ooh, ooh
You bare that cross baby, I pay the cost baby
Now you loose, it don't matter what you do
You can try to change me
You can say what you want with you pretty little lies
You can beg, you can plead
But you won't get to me this time, this time
But you can try
Use all the strength you got, go on take your best shot
But it won't touch me, I know I won't feel a thing
You've left me no choice baby, listen to my voice baby
I mean what I mean
But you can try to change me
You can say what you want with you pretty little lies
You can beg, you can plead
But you won't get to me this time, this time
But you can try
Try
(Try, try)
Try
(Try, try)
You can try to change me
You can say what you want with you pretty little lies
You can beg, you can plead
But you won't get to me this time, this time
But you can try, you can try, yeah
You spun that web baby, you made that bed baby
You can try but you won't change my mind
No you won't change my mind"
"Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You don't love me, it's plain
I should know you'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life a new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you"
"When peace like a river
Attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows, roll
Whatever my lot
Thou has taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
My sin, oh, the bliss
Of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Oh, my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
And Lord, haste the day
When the faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
With my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul"
"(Dolly Parton)
I know that you're out there
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you
In your heart and in your mind
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you
And I know that you know
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me
And when the world has chained you down
I know you know my love will set you free
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you
I have come to know and love you
Like I've never known or loved another
Words have not been made
That could describe these feelings we have for each other
And I would go to any length
To let you know at all times that I care
'Cause I want you to know
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you"
"Dear mama I'm coming home tomorrow
If you don't mind would you meet me at the train
Dear mama my wandering days're over and it's so good to be coming home again
Dear mama we'll walk the fields together
And through the valley we will stroll hand in hand
I just can't wait to see you and touch the soil of home so clean
But mama I'm not the boy I used to be
For I've been gone away too long and I've done everything that's wrong
But I think I've finally found myself at last
And just you wait and see another chance is all I need
But mama I'm not the boy I used to be
You see mama I've spent time in prison for a crime that I'm too ashamed to tell
And when you meet me there tomorrow don't be surprised at what you'll see
Cause mama I'm not the boy I used to be
For I've been gone away too long..."
"Well I'm tired of travelin' down this rocky old road
This old heart of mine is so hurtin' from a heavy load
Only Jesus knows the way my heart went wrong
But the Lord he knows I'm bout to bringin' on home
Oh I'm bringin' it yes I'm bringin' it
I'm bringin' it hear me talkin' I said I'm bringin' it
This old heart's been away too long and I'm bringin' it home
When the angels come and carry me away
And I have to face the Lord on that judgement day
I've got a half an hour to stand before His throne
That means to changin' my heart and I'm a bringin' it home
Oh I'm bringin' it
Someday children you're gonna hear that trumpet's sound
There'll be lightnin' and thunder and earthquakes in the ground
[ Dallas ]
Don't let the devil tell you that your hope is gone
There'll be a whole lotta fights that will never go on
Oh I'm bringin' it
Oh I'm bringin' it"
"Walking from the bus stop
Couldn't wait to get off
I know I'll be the lucky one
Walking through the twilight
Cold Nevada twilight
I know I am the lucky one
On the wheels
On the tabletops
On the handles with my shirt off
On the floor
On my heels again
I know I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm
I'm standing on the corner
If I could find a dollar
I know I'd be the lucky one"
"Pardon me if I can't keep my hands off of you
I can't seem to help it you see
Just a touch of your hand is a dream I can't live
Loving you is a way of life with me
If I had to walk along through this world without you
I'd fall like a leaf from a tree
Pardon me if I can't leave your lips alone
I've just got to taste them again
And again and again and again for you see
Loving you is a way of life with me
[ steel ]
If I had to walk along..."
"Down in the valley valley so low
Hang your head over hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow dear hear the wind blow
Hang your head over hear the wind blow.
Roses love sunshine violets love dew
Angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you dear know I love you
Angels in heaven know I love you.
If you don't love me love whom you please
Throw your arms 'round me give my heart ease
Give my heart ease love give my heart ease
Throw your arms round me give my heart ease.
Build me a castle forty feet high
So I can see him as he rides by
As he rides by love as he rides by
So I can see him as he rides by."
"When the oil stops, everything stops, nothing left in the fountain
Nobody wants paper money son, so you just well stop countin'
Can you break the horse, can you light the fire, what's that I beg your pardon
You best start thinking where food comes from and I hope you tend a good garden
Getting down on the mountain, getting down on the moutain
Dont wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin on down the mountain
When the truck dont run, the bread dont come , have a hard time finding petrol
Water aint runnin in the city no more do hold any precious metal
Can you gut the fish, can you read the sky, whats that about over crowdin'
You ever seen a man who's kids aint ate for 17 days and countin'
Getting down on the mountain, getting down on the moutain
Dont wanna be around when the shit goes down
I'll be gettin' on down the mountain
solo
There aint no heat and the powers gone out, It's kerosene lamps and candles
The roads are blocked its all grid locked, you got a short wave handle
Can you track the dear , can you dig the well, couldnt quiet hear your answer
I think I see a rip in the social fabric, brother can you spare some ammo
Getting down on the mountain, getting down on the moutain
Dont wanna be around when the shit goes down
Gettin on down the mountain
Solo
When the oil stops, everything stops, nothing left in the fountain
Nobody wants paper money son, so you just well stop countin'
Can you break the horse, can you light the fire, whats that I beg your pardon
I think I see a rip in the social fabric; brother can you passthe ammo
Getting down on the mountain, getting down on the mountain
Dont wanna be around when the shit goes down
Gettin on down the mountain x2"
"Sometimes you may think I take you for granted
And granted, sometimes maybe I do
'Cause I've grown so used to you lying next to me
That I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
[Chorus]
No I wouldn't want to get up in the morning if you weren't there
To kiss me and start my day off right
And to be waiting when I get home with loving just for me
No I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me
It's love that makes the world go round
And my love for you just grows with leaps and bounds
'Cause you know just what to do when the world has turned all blue
And I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me"
"My baby dreams while he's awake
He slips down city streets
His soles are worn so that he skates
While he's walking
My baby laughs while he's asleep
Too hot to worry
He kicks the covers with his feet
While he's laughing
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
My baby's eyes are open
But he can't see what I'm showing him
Not turquoise like a swimming pool
But calm and gray like morning
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
My baby, baby's man enough
To reach and touch a heart that's beating
Violet falls across the land
The sun's gone down it's evening
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
I've got the right side
The right side
The right side
The right side"

Mama where'd I come from did they give me to you free
Did you buy me in a boystore mama where'd you find me
Well Bobby I found you in a smile
And the gentleness hidden in your daddy's eyes
Freddie said a bird came and left me in a tree
Mama where'd I come from that don't sound right to me
Well I'll tell you darling God in all his sweetness smiled on us yes he did
Then an angel and brought you on the wings of love
Did a doctor bring me like John said he did
And if a doctor brought me where they get kids
Well sweetheart can you keep a secret hmmm well just between a mother and her son
I'll tell ye you were born of love and that's where you came from
Well Bobby now do you know where you came from yes...where...love"
"We've all seen enough wrong and right
To know everything's not black and white
There's always something in between
No matter how long or well you live
You don't get anything you don't give
Still no slate is clean
For better or worse, anybody can
Take a look around and find a better man
Upright no matter how he's faring
No matter what kind of shoes he's wearing
The shoes he's wearing
They don't make the man
So many people out running around
Handicapped before they hit the ground
Thinking there's nowhere to go
Shouldn't we all be looking for ways
To keep on seeing our better days
We're not chained to what we know
But if your eyes are open and your mind is free
There's no tellin' what a man can be
Upright no matter how you're faring
No matter what kind of shoes you're wearing
The shoes you're wearing
They don't make the man"
"We're not strong enough to bend
We're not strong enough to say we can forgive
We're not brave enough to fall
Oh, and we're not big enough to risk it all
But love is, love is
It's always been, it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is
We can't resist another fling
We're not able to live above the bling
But love is, love is
It's always been, it always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is
We may not be ready
Anywhere close to a start
But wherever we are
Love is
It's always been, it always will be
I may not be perfect
But love is
Hey, love is
Love is"
"Why why why did you say goodbye
Why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy
What did I do

To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong

"For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
Into each life a love is born for one and one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know our love was never meant to be
For your poison love has stained the life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
For my pleading has all been in vain for you and you alone dear
And you know that you are guilty of the same
But still my heart cries out for you and you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain for your and you alone dear
And my better judgment tells me to say no"
"Sat at my window watched the world
Wake up this morning
Purple sky slowly turning golden,
Distant elms so orange
You'd swear they're burning
All this flowing water
Has got my mind wandering
Do you ever finally reach
A point of knowing
Or do you just wake up one day
And say I am going?
What will I tell you
When you ask me why I'm crying?
Will I point above
At the Red Tail gracefully soaring
Or down to below where its prey
Is quietly trembling?
Two thousand years ago Jesus is left is left there hanging
Purple sky slowly turning golden
Cowards at his feet loudly laughing
Loved ones stumbling homeward
Their worlds reeling
Red Tail above my head quietly soaring
Water turns from ice, creek is roaring
He says enough of all this shit, I am going"
"Down in the valley the valley so low
Late in the evening hear the train blow
Hear the train blow boys oh hear the train blow
Down in the valley hear the train blow
Write me a letter send it by mail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
(Write me a letter containing three lines)
Answer my question will you be mine
(Roses love sunshine violets love dew)
Angels in heaven know I love you
Know I love you dear know I love you
Angels in heaven know I love you
Down in the valley the valley so low
Late in the evening hear the train blow"
"VERSE 1
I want you to know I thought Id see you tonight
But youre too damn stubborn to see wrong and right
Where did you go, youve been here all of my life
I guess it got too hot and you just couldnt handle the fire
CHORUS
But youre not the first you know, and you wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens, waitin down at the pass
When you figure it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let you on the train that Im on, cause its movin too fast
VERSE 2
Her name was Amy, it was 1992
I promised her the world and she promised me the moon
But she couldnt take it, my life and the road
She listened to the voices, packed her bags and headed back home
CHORUS
Shes not the first you know and she wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens, waitin down at the pass
But when she figures it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let her on the train that Im on cause its movin too fast
VERSE 3
So take a deep breath, and free your mind
Light all you r candles and jump to the fire
You cant see me for the smoke, its heaven and its hell
But I wont be surprised or hurt, if you decide to bail
CHORUS
But youre not the first you know, and you wont be the last
Theres a long list of has beens waitin down at the pass
And when you figure it out, that Im not white trash
They wont let you on the train that Im on, cause its movin too fast"

But he will never love you never more than I
Your pillard home all dressed in white will be cold on the summer's night
Cause he will never love you never more than I
Wealth and possession I admit I don't have very much of
I was born and raised a poor boy and all we had was love
So if you want what's made of clay take his hand and walk away
But he will never love you never more than I
[ ac.guitar ]
Wealth and possession I admit...
But he will never love you never more than I"
"I met a man at the airport
Going home cause his brother had died
I tried to soften his sorrow
He smiled at me and replied
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
I keep his words in my memory
They keep my heart from consent
It's a lesson for livin
I'd pass on to all that I meet
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
No one knows how long their journey may be
Its not how far but how well you've traveled
That god will see
The old man smiled and departed
Our brief encounter ended
He left the seeds of a memory
And words I'll never forget
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
We're all passin through
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
Do what you can
You're fellow man is travelin too
We're all passin through
We're all passin through
We're all passin through"
"It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Until the sun set of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes
My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prays
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
Brought me here
To be with you
I'll be forever grateful
Oh forever thankful
My dreams came true
When I found you
My miracle
Oh
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prays
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here"
"I dreamed of my dad and my mama, and baby when she was just 3, and I know that someday they'll be waiting..."
"Just when I thought
The demons I fought
Were dead and gone
Straight out of the blue
Someone like you
Comes along
And I don't have to turn
And look over my shoulder
I already know
From the sound
There's a thousand wild horses
Thundering behind me
Hellbent on runnin' me down
I thought I was fast
But the sins of my past
They're faster still
And I'm wasting my time
Tryin' to leave them behind
Cause I never will
One drink too many
One kiss too deep
And I feel that old shacking the ground
That's a thousand wild horses
Thundering behind me
Hellbent on runnin' me down
Each one is branded
Each one is mine
Each one's a darkness
I can't deny
I know they are coming
There's no place to hide
I'm gonna get run down
Or I'm gonna ride
Right now
They're just a big cloud of dust
But pretty soon
I'll do something stupid
Like I tend to do
And I let them loose
So if you're thinking that maybe
That you're the one who can save me
Baby this ain't no merry-go-round
It's a thousand wild horses
Thundering behind me
Hellbent on runnin' me down
I got a thousand wild horses
Thundering behind me
Hellbent on runnin' me down"
"Her birthday came and went without a card, or a single i love you
On their anniversary she sat all alone at a table set for two
She tries her best to please him, but she never hears one single word of praise
She feels just like a stranger, in a home where love has seen its better days
Well he's taken her for granted
God only knows why she keeps hangin' on
'Cause it's better to be gone, but not forgotten
Than to be forgotten, but not gone
Somehow he can't remember, when he's late to even take the time to call
And even on the nights he's there she gets the feeling he's not there at all
She's become a prisoner in that big old house where sweet love used to be
Well, it's not even over but lord she feels just like a memory
Well he's taken her for granted
God only knows why she keeps hangin' on
'Cause it's better to be gone, but not forgotten
Than to be forgotten, but not gone"
"Can't eat,can't sleep
All I do is think about you
Hold on, what's this feelin'
That's my heart your stealin'
That's okay my baby, I don't want it back
What's this chemistry, such intensity
And good emotion gettin' through
[Chorus:]
It's your sweet love, I'm feelin' it
Can't get enough, go figure it
Madly, deeply, baby I'm fallin'
Head over heels, I'm livin' it
Heart and soul, you're givin' it
I'm thinkin' that
I'm diggin' it
Come on keep it comin'
Think you're onto somethin'
So strong, so right, it's gotta be real
You're breakin' down the walls and fences
There's a powerful sense of
Good emotion gettin' through
[Chorus x 2]"
"The wedding bells have barely stopped their ringing
But already all your love for me is gone
On the day that we were wed well I guess we should have said
For better or for worse but not for long
Now my dream of love has turned into a nightmare
For you say that in your life I don't belong
You said your vows I said mine but we both left out one line
For better or for worse but not for long
All the lifetime that we planned has been a short one
And the love that couldn't die did not live long
I wanted you eternally but you only wanted me
For better or for worse but not for long for better or for worse but not for long"
"Here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
And our weary hearts are yearning for a rest
And we find we're gettin' anxious to be in that happy land
Where we'll reseive such peace and happiness
Wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus a few more days to get our loved ones in
We may look into the skies and tears may fill our eyes
For our burdened heart grows heavier with each day
First we cry oh Lord please come come take your children home
But then we look around us and we say
Wait a little longer..."
"I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago they still make me blue
They say that time heels a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you"
"I'm always on the road
You're always all alone
And I'm not always there when I'm at home
But I'm ready for a little change
I'm ready to accept some blame
So let's back up to yesterday
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you
It's not like it was
When we fell in love
When all we had was enough
Well I don't like the blues
I like love that's true
Honey, let's get back to me and you
Let's get back in love
Back to dreamin' of
All those little things we used to do
Let's start holdin' hands
Let's start makin' plans
Honey, let's get back to me and you
Well honey, let's get on back to me and you"
"He's always around at all the wrong times
He's a businessman got his nose in mine
Lays down the law and says what he feels
Threatinin' and a gettin' all up in my grill
That man's got eyes all over this town
Got us under surveillance when I take her out
She ain't just his daughter she's his only one
Sure makes it hard to get away from
My baby's daddy
Ain't no kind of crazy like my baby's daddy
Ain't nobody hates me like my baby's daddy, yeah
I'd a married that girl a few months back
If I knew I didn't have to ask my baby's daddy
I'm just an ex VP of the FFA
And that SOB is like the CIA
I go from workin' on the tractor and the irrigation
To a date night livin' room interrogation
It's hard to get further than a kiss goodnight
When he's tappin' on my window pointin' at the time
Old sucker rooster blockin' my fun
I think he'd rather her be a nun
My baby's daddy
Ain't no kind of crazy like my baby's daddy
Ain't nobody hates me like my baby's daddy, yeah
I'd a married that girl a few months back
If I knew I didn't have to ask my baby's daddy
Could've had the honeymoon and done been back
If I'd a just bucked up and asked
My baby's daddy
Bout to have me a little talk with my baby's daddy
Gonna have him a son in law
Gonna marry that girl like it or not
That's if I don't get shot oh
By baby's daddy
Can't nobody save me from my baby's daddy
Ain't nobody crazy like my baby's daddy, yeah
Crazy SOB, but I love him"
"TALK TO HER HEART
(Bill Anderson - Jim Weatherly - Steve Wariner)
'99 Sony/ATV Songs
RECORDED BY STEVE WARINER
Boys we're living in a brave new world
Let me tell you what I've learned about girls
In this age of high tech and state of the art
When it comes to love you've still gotta talk to her heart
She can have a college degree MBA or a PhD
She can be strong and she can be smart
But when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real
You got to tell her how you really do feel
Don't talk about fishin' don't talk about cars
Talk about the moon and talk about the stars
Tell her she's beautiful just talk to her heart
You got to be honest you got to be real...
Well there's been a lot of changes since time began
But nothing's changed between a woman and a man
It's how things were it's how things are
When it comes to love you've still got to talk to her heart
Yeah when it comes to love you've still got to talk to her"
"I've had big dreams come true
And I believe in angels
Although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do
Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind 'cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you
I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth living
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had answered
I did something right
'Cause baby I got you
The rain keeps the flowers from dying
He sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and the moon
And baby I got you"
"Notice the fall of the city
Please watch it closely
The sun outside shining
The moon also hanging
The years start to gather
Your dreams start to tatter
Your tears busy fuelling this song I'm singing tonight
Through those hopeless nights
I wander alone
Through those hopeless nights
You hold me hand
Happiness a distance we'll never see
This cool fall night only confuses me
At night when we should be sleeping
I lie awake and hear you weeping
About all the things you ever wanted
About all the things that now haunt you
The years start to gather your dreams start to tatter
Your tears busy fuelling this song I'm singing tonight
Through those hopeless nights I wander alone
Through those hopeless nights you hold my hand
Happiness a distance we'll never see
This cool fall night hanging over me"
"Down on her street, I've got someone
I really want you to meet
In good time, like all things
A prayer for a plum
Up all night waiting for the mail to come
In a lightless window
I've been afraid to depend on love
And it's fare thee well my friend
I'll see you at the promised land
Where the wind is laughter
And that home we never made
Is waiting in the desert shade
Happily ever after
Down on her street, I've got someone
I really want you to meet
In good time, like all things
Step into place, take my heart
Put it in a pillowcase
It's been still for hours
We can get high down on Old Kings Road
And watch as the lights explode
I can get lost if you want me to
And it's fare thee well my friend
I'll see you at the promised land
Where the wind is laughter
And that home we never made
Is waiting in the desert shade
Happily ever after"
"Lord knows, I need to hear the things,
You're whisperin' in my ear.
Even though I know that they're not true.
It's as warm as weakness,
Wantin' arms to hold her near.
But you already have someone who gives all her love to you.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
You should be tellin' her the things you're tellin' me:
Like how much you need me,
An' always want me near,
Oh, it's such a lovely line.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
Sure, I can feel the fire,
An' the wanting when we touch.
An' layin' down would sure be good with you.
You know all the words that make,
A woman feel so much.
Oh, it would be so easy but it's not the thing to do.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine.
You should be tellin' her the things you're tellin' me:
Like how much you need me,
An' always want me near,
Oh, it's such a lovely line.
You should be layin' in her arms,
Instead of lyin' here in mine."
"I want some red roses for a blue lady
Mr Florest take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day
Hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away
Wrap up some red roses for a blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown
(I want some red roses for a blue lady)
We had a silly quarrel
(Best white orchid for her wedding gown)"
"Though I can't come to see you every day
It just happened things turned out that way
But that don't mean you're not the apple of your daddy's eye
And as long as there's a Sunday I'll come by
As long as there's a Sunday your daddy's here
Though I think about and love you all the time
And even though dear some have said I have no right to you
As long as there's a Sunday you'll be mine
And someday dear I hope you'll understand that I come by as often as I can
So you be good and mind your mom and tell her I said hi
And as long as there's a Sunday I'll come by
And as long as there's a Sunday I'll come by"
"I'm walkin' in love land holdin' your hand
Here in the warm sand walkin' with you
Walkin' in love land feelin' so grand
Walkin' in love land baby with you
I'm happy as I can be while you're here with me
Here in the moonlight watching the tide roll in
I feel your warm touch love you so much
Walkin' in love land baby with you
I've been walkin' in love land you know it makes me feel so fine
I've been walkin' in love land ever since you've been mine
The stars look so bright cause you're mine tonight
Walkin' in love land here with you
Walkin' in love land feelin' so grand
Walkin' in love land baby with you
Baby with you in love land with you
A walkin' with you baby with you"
"Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured
Santa was much too thin
[Chorus]
He didn't come down the chimney
So mama must have let him in
Santa looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
Well, they thought I was fast-a-sleppin'
They thought that I was tucked in his bed
They never thought I'd come a-peepin'
Or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama
And mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy
Well then I'm a gonna tell on them
[Chorus]
I never saw Dancer or Prancer
I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw a red-nosed reindeer
Like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought lots of presents
So Santa Claus he must have been
Well he sure looked a lot like daddy
Or daddy looked a lot like him
[Chorus]"
"Daily grind is stealing me away again
When I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolving around us
We'd still be there and forever if the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough
Is time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
Time with you
I'm gone for now to do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live
For time with you more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Ah there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Then spend time with you
More time with you"
"You can't stop the wild wind from blowing
You can't stop the wild wind from blowing
Let us live just for tonight don't think of tomorrow
Any thoughts of loving me can only lead to sorrow
For soon I'll be going and you can't stop the wild wind from blowing
No you can't stop the wild wind from blowing
Wild and free I gotta be I've got to be going
And you can't stop the wild wind from blowing
You can't stop the wild wind from blowing
Your lips are soft your kisses sweet and in your arms I love you
I can give just part of me then move on I've just got to
Like a wild raging river you can't stop the water from flowing
And you can't stop the wild wind from blowing
Wild and free I gotta be I've got to be going..."
"Well I came from Alabama
With a banjo on my knee
I'm goin' to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It had rained all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The son so hot I froze to death
Susanna don't you cry
I got a long way to go
I sure feel it now
Deep down in these dusty clothes
Through another town
Backed up with capricious souls
I got a long way to go
I got a lot left to say
To the empty seat
The stood beside me through the fray
To the midnight moon
who saw it fit to light my way
I got a lot left to say
Chorus:
But where do I got from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you
I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
Comin' down the hill
A buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
says I'm comin' from the south
Susanna don't you cry
Repeat Chorus:
Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Susanna
I'll fall down on the ground
And if I do not find her
Then I shall surley die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna Don't you cry for me"
"Been around enough to know
When a man is lying its bound to show
Its written on his face
The letters in the capital case
Guilty of these crimes he cause
Treat cheaters like they fired the law
But he proclaims undying love
I wonder who hes speaking of
Cause all he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
Its killing me to find a man out there,
You'd think I'd find me one who cared
Show me some security and endues some sweet serenity
I cant keep up with who's is what
Boy this affair ain't fair enough
Men like him they love the chase
Girls give him time he'll throw the race
All he ever seems to do is break my little heart in two
I cant pretend I understand what makes a woman want a man
But all he ever seems to do is break her little heart in two
Run out the door jump in the car
But I never seem to get real far
Around the corner hit the gas
Drive fast enough and ill burn the past
Play the radio real loud,
Days like this make mommas proud
Feeling free feels good to me
And I'm right back where I used to be
All he's ever going to do oh I know its sad but true
All he's ever going to do is break her little heart in two
Break her little heart in two"
"I never knew how people wound up in a bar
In the middle of the day
Broken souls with broken lives
From the choices that they made
I didn't know how much I had to lose
When I threw it all away
But I do now, I do now
Oh, I'd give anything
If I could just go back in time somehow
I wouldn't break your heart
I wouldn't break those vows
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye
And say I do now
Standing before God and all our friends
In that little church
Barely listening to a thing that preacher said
Just repeating every word
I didn't have a clue what it all meant
But girl, for what it's worth
I do now, I do now
Oh, I'd give anything
If I could just go back in time somehow
I wouldn't break your heart
I wouldn't break those vows
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye
And say I do now
I wouldn't break your heart
I wouldn't break those vows
If I could lift that veil and look you in the eye
And say I do now"

Which way is Santa Fe, New Mexico
I've got some things to say, she needs to know
Small brown adobe there, where lives my heart
I just can't make it here, with us apart
Which way is Santa Fe, New Mexico
There was a dream I had, I had to see
Salt of the ocean breeze, calling to me
So much for me to do, so much to be
Where is the dream I had, what do I see
How can so much so right, be wrong
Why should you have to leave
To know where you belong"
"I'll share my world with you everything that I own
My earthly possessions there's no good if I'm alone
Let me bring you the sunshine when it's fresh with morning dew
Can't you see that I'm waiting to share my world with you
I'll share my world with you if you'll be mine alone
I'll give you a new heart you're the only love it's known
Let me give you my two arms they'll be happy if you do
Can't you see they are waiting to share my world with you

I'll share my world with you everything that we'll see
Divide all the memories one for you and one for me

"These things happen
Love never comes with a guarantee
No hard meetings
But it looks like this love was never meant to be
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
There'll be changes
Times never been known to ever stand still
Lonely losers
Hold to a promise they'll never fulfill
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way
That's easy for you to say
You tell me you know hat it's wrong
To walk out this way
But in time my true love will come
And I'll thank you some day
That's easy for you to say
You've got another who's willing and waiting for you
That's easy for you to say
You're not the one with the heart that's breaking in two
You tell me it's better this way

"Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on a summer from a slot machine
Yes, you can get what you want, if you want it
'Cause you can get anything
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
With your heavy loads pumping petrol gas
And you make 'em long and you make 'em tough
And you just go on and on and it seems you can't get off
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
But you keep on buildin' higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh?
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live?
Will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Tell me where do the children play?
Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
But, where do the children play?
Just tell me where do the children play?"

I am a backseat driver from america
They drive to the left on falls road
And the man at the wheels name is Shamus
We pass a the child on a corner he knows.
And shamus says now what chance has that kid got
And I say from the back I don't know
He says there's barbed wire at all of these exits
There ain't no place in Belfast for that kid to go.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.
--- Instrumental ---
At the dairyline in Chicago
A fat man in front of me
He's calling black people trash to his children
He's the only trash here I see.
And I'm thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But they'll slip to their windows and see him
They'll think that white hood's all they need.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.

I was a child of the sixties
When dreams could be held through tears
With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther
And I belived, I believed, I believed.
Now I'm a backseat driver from America
And I'm not at the wheel of control
And I am guilty, I am worn, I am the root of all evil
And I can't drive on the left side of the road.
And it's a hard life, it's a hard life
It's a very hard life, it's a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know.
And there ain't no place in this world for these kids to go
'Cause it's a hard life wherever you go...

Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone

Can you tell me where he's gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone.
Didn't you love the things they stood for
Didn't they try to find some good
In you and me and we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day.
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
can you tell me where he's gone
I thought I saw him walking up over the hill

"I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I gave all my love to you and I took all your hurt
I treated you so good but you treated me like dirt
They say love is give and take now my poor heart is breaking
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I always gave you everything that I knew how to give
You always took advantage of me you knew I would forgive
I treated you too good for my own good now I'm alone and left forsaken
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
The giving and the taking have caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give and I've taken all that I can take
[ guitar ]
The givng and the taking..."
"Disappearing taillights
Going round the bend
I dont know where shes headed to
But she wont be back again
Shes the one who loved me
Until I broke her heart
Disappearing taillights
Leaving me here in the dark
I watched them as they faded
Getting smaller every mile
I guess its really over now
And it has been for a while
I never had imagined
That shed ever go this far
Disappearing taillights leaving me here in the dark
Disappearing taillights
It hurts to see her leaving
Sure didnt plan on being on my own
Now shes almost out of sight
And suddenly it hits me
Shes about to me a memory when shes gone
Now shes long gone
Disappearing taillights
Too far away to come back now
I suppose that ill forget her
But Im really not sure how
I thought I saw her turning
But it was just a falling star
Disappearing taillights
Leaving me here in the dark"
"You saved me from melting, baby
You saved me from stinging and being holed up
And braking in snow and killing more
And over spilling my runneth cup
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
You had movement out of my sight
You wore no shoes and ate like a leopard
And slept with your legs apart every night
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with me
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
I thought you had took all you had to take
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake"
"I've got to leave that man alone that makes a fool of me
I've got to leave while I've still got my pride
If I'd stay around much longer it'll be too late for me
I'd better listen to that voice I hear inside
That man doesn't love you girl can't you see he's just using you
That man doesn't love you girl that man ain't the man for you
I'd seen the way he looks at girls with hunger in his eyes
And I felt the coldness of his lips on mine
He still tells me he loves me but I can tell he lies
Cause I hear that little voice inside my mind
That man doesn't love you girl...
That man ain't the man for you"
"Well, won't you lend your lungs to me? Mine are collapsing
Plant my feet and bitterly breathe up the time that's passing
Breath, I'll take and breath, I'll give and pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live in lonely indecision
Fingers walk the darkness down, mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found, you fool, it's only moonlight
And if you try to take it home your hands will turn to butter
You better leave this dream alone, try to find another
Salvation sat and crossed herself and called The Devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf, who'll kill the raging cancer?
Seal the river at it's mouth, take the water prisoner
Fill the skies with screams and cries, bathe in fiery answers
Jesus was an only son and love his only concept
Strangers talk in foreign tongues and dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two ain't got time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world we tried
Keep your injured looks to you, we'll tell the world we tried"
"I was raised on the good book
and taught to believe.
Faith was instilled in my soul.
It was better to give
than to receive.
I was bound for the streets
paved with gold.
Then I lost my way,
forgot how to pray.
Just a backslider out in the cold.
He didn't give up on me
the Lord set me free
and faith came back to me
Faith came back to me.
I was blind but now I can see.
I was wand'ring in sin
so aimlessly
and faith came back to me
Now I spend my days
singing His praise.
Thanks, mom and daddy,
for raisin' me right.
That strong foundation
in the right direction
helps me make it through the darkest night.
Faith came back to me.
I was blind but now I can see.
I was wand'ring in sin
so aimlessly
and faith came back to me.
When his children are taught wrong from right
they will always come back to his side.
And faith came back to me.
I was blind but now I can see.
I called out to thee
Oh Lord, hear my plea
and faith came back to me.
Like in old Galilee
He showed His mercy
and faith came back to me."
"I really go for you knowin' in my heart you won't be there
I'd cross the seven seas your smallest whim to please
Around the world and then all the way back again
To love the way I do seems so unfair
I really go for you knowin' in my heart you won't be there
I really go for you oh can't you see
How much I want you to go for me
A little love that's true each none and all
I really go for you dream a mighty big to be so small
I really go for you it's more real
I really want you to feell what I feel
The message can't get through my heart could say
I really go for you I wish you go with me all the way"
"There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your door step
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
[Chorus:]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you
What is this spell that's on me
Make me think you own me
Why do I keep holding on to you
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you
[Chorus:]"
"Who's gonna dry your big blue eyes day after day
Who's gonna jump when you say frog who's gonna bow and stray
After I've gone away
Who's gonna kiss ye and who's gonna miss ye who's gonna hold to your hand
Who's gonna chap your candle in wood after I've made new plans
Hey who's gonna be your man
Who's gonna bring you your breakfast in bed who's gonna whisper goodnight
Who's gonna keep you warm as toast on those cold winter nights
And who's gonna be your puppy dog when I'm a thing of the past
Hey who's gonna mow your grass"
"My friends and me work overtime
All try to walk the bottom line
You've been breathin' down our necks
But soon as we cash our paychecks
We'll be chillin' on my deck, Boss Man
Chorus:
There's nothin' you can do, nothin' you can say
Nothin' you can throw our way come Friday
We've been rubber stampin' paper clippin'
Sortin' fillin' faxin'
It's time to let the good times roll
Nothin' you can say, nothin' you can do
Nothin' that can wreck our mood come Friday
We've been roofin' rakin' truckin' pavin
Packin' stackin' layin' block
Farmin' fencin' monkey wrenchin' pickin' up and droppin' off
We can't wait to punch the clock
Come Friday - yeah!
Gonna fill my igloo full of ice
Stock up on my way home tonight
Light tiki torches and the grill
Put speakers on the windowsill
Play our music loud and dance all night
Repeat Chorus
We'll be horseshoein' barbecuin' flippin'
Sippin' kickin' back
Lawn chairin' music blarin' laughin' havin' us a blast
Work all week until at last-
It's Friday
It's Friday - yeah!
Whoa!"
"There should be music
Sad music
But this silence that you left
Is all I have
I must have missed a couple days or just forgotten
What went wrong or where it all
Fell apart
Oh and I know you must have told me you were leavin'
It just never crossed my mind you'd take my heart
There should be music
Sad music
The kind the movies have when love like ours goes bad
There should be music
Sad music
But this silence that you left
Is all I have
I'd swear that I woke up with you this morning
But I can see that's it been days since you were here
Oh and every night it still hits home without a warning
As my world becomes a flood of scalding tears
There should be music
Sad music
As you walk away without looking back
There should be music
Sad music
But this silence that you left is all I have
There should be music
Sad music"
"She's been staring out the window four nights in a row
Like a caged up tiger, she's pacing the floor
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
And when she gets like this, I gotta let her go
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere
She can turn it loose and howl
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door
When she winks at me and smiles
She's in a foot stompin,' honky-tonkin'
Love making state of mind
So excuse me, why'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild
If there's ever been a lady, well, baby is
Just more of a woman at times like this
Now, don't you worry about baby stepping out of line
Yeah, she drives me crazy, but it suits me fine
She's hard to handle, so I hold on tight
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight
She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere
She can turn it loose and howl
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door
When she winks at me and smiles
She's in a foot stompin,' honky-tonkin'
Love making state of mind
So excuse me, why'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild"
"While sleeping on my shoulder your lips have softly spoke his name
And with those two arms around me you're still not close to me
Your morning smile reveals that he was with you in your dreams
Why must you let him keep on walking on the edge of your mem'ry
I know you tried but he's still walking on the edge of you mem'ry
Outside you change your image but inside you're still his girl
And to me the sunset means another long night filled with mis'ry
Because I know I hear him walking on the edge of your mem'ry
[ steel ]
I know you tried..."
"As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we've had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling, more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
And with every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love, and remember our faded love"
"Started out late
In my dirty plaid coat
Watched my heel
Lift the dead satin dress
From the ground
One day I touched it with my hands
And it scattered like scared birds
By 3a.m. they were pidgeons
With drinking problems and bad luck
On god's front porch
Where the wind
Is dense with insects
Where the wind
Is dense with bugs
Made of coffee and guitars"
"There's a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea
It's been tossed about, lost and broken wandering aimlessly
And God somehow you know that ship is me
'Cause there's a light house, in a harbor shining faithfully,
Pouring its life out across the water, for this sinking soul in the sea
That someone out there still believes in me
On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on
Oh, raining down, against the wind, I'm reaching out,
'Til we reach the circle's end, when you come back to me again
There's a moment, that we all come to, in our own time, in our space
For all that we've done, we can undo if our heart's in the right place
On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on
Oh, raining down, against the wind, I'm reaching out,
'Til we reach the circle's end, when you come back to me again
And again I see my yesterdays in front of me, unfolding like a mystery,
Your changing all that is and used to be
On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on
Oh, raining down, against the wind, I'm reaching out,
'Til we reach the circle's end, when you come back to me again
When you come back to me again"
"HEAVY TEARS
(John Hiatt)
'76 Tree Publishing
One day you're happy the next day you're blue
You feel like the whole world's comin' right down on you
There ain't nothin' wrong but then there ain't nothin' right
It's just the kind of thing that keeps you up all night
Heavy tears in your eyes
Lord don't they hurt you when you cry
Heavy tears in your eyes
And when they hit the ground don't they make a terrible sound
Maybe she loves you and maybe it's a joke
And maybe that fire was just a whole lot of smoke
You don't feel warm but then you don't feel cold
You're just gettin' weary you're just gettin' old
Heavy tears in your eyes...
And your mind can't take this worry and your heart feels underfed
Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow or maybe you'll just stay in bed
Don't call the doctor and ask his advice
Cause he's felt the same way himself once or twice
And there ain't no cure for the tear in your eye
You just gotta sit there you just gotta cry
Heavy tears in your eyes..."
"Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
It was a bright moon light night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I moaned like a turtle dove
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darlin', I'm coming home
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darlin', I'm coming home
Down in the pasture where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying
Down in the pasture where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying
It was a bright moon light night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I moaned like a turtle dove
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me"
"Walkin' away I saw a side of you
That I knew was there all along
And that someday I'd say goodbye to you
'Cause one right can still make two wrong
Not for each other, not from the start
The difference was day and night
My finest hour spent here with you in the dark
Was just before I saw the light
It's the people who want love and the people who need love
Who find love on the way
I'll be lookin' for someone 'til I find the right one
Then I won't be walkin away
Now that I know what I'm tryin' to find
There's only one place it could be
So I'm lookin' ahead, I've stopped lookin' behind
For someone who's lookin' for me"
"The honeymoon is over
The honeymoon is over
Back in the dance halls again
Back in the dance halls again
The kids are all so violent
The kids are all so violent
I'm a fool for the latest trends
I'm a fool for the latest trends
Robitussin and an 808
Slow dancing, with a stranger's date
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be back again
The girls in strange attire
I really love Richard Pryor
I don't care about anything
Smooth jazz in the evening
In the room you made a mess
On the floor is a cocktail dress
I always thought I was born
To die young and blow a horn
A line of K and a diet Sprite
Take my hand, lets drift through this night
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to good
Damn it feels good to be back again
Damn it feels good to be back"
"Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
I wanna see the world
I wanna touch your face
I wanna go right there
And never leave that place
I wanna fall back down
I wanna lose the day
I wanna get it back
In the baddest way
I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh, us again
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh
We were a Friday night
After a football game
We were the coolest car
Moving down the interstate
Oh, I know it's there
Still see us there
How'd we get away
How'd we get away
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
Soaked us, deep in love
We would fall every time
We got back up
So we laid there
And just lose tonight
So baby why don't I
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We went every time, yeah
Midnight, pick you up
Take you on a slow drive
You and I hanging there
Kissing in the street light
Didn't matter where or when
We just went every time
So tell me will you take me there
Somewhere only you know where
I know we can be better
Than we've ever been
If we could be us again
If we can be us again
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Just how far does the universe go
Does it ever end, you say you wanna know
Just how high can you count?
Before the numbers all run out
Who built the pyramids?
Do aliens exist?
Where does God come from?
One more phenomenon,
But if you know how strong my love is
And your heart and mine can comprehend
Just how long I'm gonna feel like this
Then you'll know what infinity is
Then you'll know,
They say time goes on and on
Even after we're all gone
There's a black hole up in space
That even light can't escape
Who built the pyramids?
Do aliens exist?
Where does God come from?
One more phenomenon,
But if you know how strong my love is
And your heart and mine can comprehend
Just how long I'm gonna feel like this
Then you'll know what infinity is
Then you'll know,
They'll find some answers
To all those mysteries
But they won't understand
What's between you and me
Who built the pyramids?
Do aliens exist?
Where does God come from?
One more phenomenon,
If you know how strong my love is
And your heart and mine can comprehend
Just how long I'm gonna feel like this
Then you'll know what infinity is
Then you'll know,
Then you'll know what love is"
"You stood by me whenever times were bad and never once did I hear you complain
You always made the best of what little bit we had
And held your hand up proud to wear my name
And that's just one of the reasons why I love you so much
You are the reason that I live
I know I've got a woman no other man can touch
Who gives me all the love she has to give
[ steel ]
You've sacrificed for dreams of mine that never did come true
You've done without to satisfy my needs
And everytime I've tried and failed I've found new strength in you
For not one time did you lose faith in me
And that's just one of the reasons..."
"Midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And motel rooms have been my only home
They gave me these sad knowing eyes and old age lines before my time
I guess I spent too many nights alone
Denver trains and LA games taxis through the New York rain
On everybody's party but my own
Tellin' myself love could wait now maybe girl you've come too late
I may have spent too many nights alone
I never let nobody any closer than my body and I never needed someone till now
And you know I want so much to reach out my soul and touch you
But I don't know if I know how
Cause midnight flights and barroom lights and rollin' for three days and nights
And open roads have been my only home
Learnin' ways to say goodbye and songs that only make me cry
I guess I spent too many nights alone too many nights alone"
"I've got her photograph
On a stand by my bed
Two on the mantel
And thousands in my head
I can't believe how fast she's growing
It ain't suppose to be like this
Every time I look at her
I see how much I've missed
I missed her first steps
Her first words
I love you daddy
Is something I seldom hear
Oh it hurts me so
To watch my girl grow
Up in pictures
I send the money down
I do my best to do my part
But it can't compare
With what I pay with my heart
There's still unanswered questions
That weigh heavy on my mind
Will she ever understand the reasons why
I missed her first steps
Her first words
I love you daddy
Is something I seldom hear
Oh it hurts me so
To watch my girl grow
Up in pictures
It takes all I have
To keep the tears inside
What I wouldn't give if
I could turn back time"
"Caught in the vice of heaven and earth
He turned his life into a cell
Imprisoned by the doubts which hound us all
And those desires which we all know so well
His days he lost to promises, his nights he purged of dreams
And he would wake in the hours before sunrise
And dread the coming of the day
Never thought a man could become so desperate
Never thought a life could lose so much hope
To be tearing at the roots around you
As if in manacles, or irons, or ropes
They say he told his children that all he taught was lost
That love and pride and honesty
Were to be gained at too high a cost
It's been thirty summers that I've spent with him
And I expect thirty more to pass
He has blessed my life in so many ways
That I could never turn my back
But I need just one more reminder
Of the man that he used to be
If he would just look deep into my eyes
And say it's in you my love that I will find the key"
"Cindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone
Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel"
"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Oh what peace we often forfeit of what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer"
"I'LL TAKE YOUR LOVE AT ANYTIME BABY
I have seen this old, cold world go gold and silver crazy.
Some people live to fill their pocket and it never seizes to amaze me.
If money can buy them happiness, that o'right for them I guess.
Money sure can buy a lot, but it can't buy what I've got.
CHORUS:
I'll take your love at anytime baby
It's solid as a rock, bigger than the sky
I'll take your love at anytime baby
I know it will be there as time goes by
I know I can count on you to keep the juices flowing
This thing between a man and woman beats anything else going
Talk of fortune and talk about fame
It sounds nice is the way to tame"
"(Tom Slocum)
Gliding bird gliding through the sky
I'm wondering why I can't be why I can't be as free
Gliding bird gliding all day long
Sing your secret song away from all these faces that I see
Is where I want to be
My feet are so tired
They walked too many miles
If I run so wild like heaven's child
I'll learn to fly someday
Gliding bird riding in the sun
Rainbow colors run
I hear the wind
I hear its mournful call"
"[Chorus]
Last night I came home and found you there
You with your pretty eyes and shining hair
Look at you, you're the kind of woman men stop and stare
Such a lovely lady to be mine
Such a lovely lady should be somewhere else
It seems to me, the likes of me, isn't hard to find
Sometimes going home, though it's not fair
I stop and have a drink or two, see who's there
But when I do you're the kind of woman I just leave them there
You're such a lovely lady to be mine
Such a lovely lady should be somewhere else
It seems to me, the likes of me, isn't hard to find"
"Given up on traveling'
It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train
Now a mind can wonder and that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be
I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say
About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong
But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time
Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try
Somewhere I slipped off track
I was thinking I could fly
But there never was a train
That couldn't try"
"I signed up to see this world through the windows of buses and planes
Ever since they called my number I've been livin' in the fast lane
Yeah it's a dream come true I'm a lucky man
And I love this road I'm on
But I do run out of gas
And only run so fast so long
[Chorus]
'Til I need some front porch rockin'
Some back road walkin'
Some sittin' around talkin' 'bout nothin'
I need some screen door slammin'
Some homemade jammin'
Some biscuits cookin' in the oven
I need a little fun with my little ones
A little gospel on Sunday
I need some hangin' 'round my little town in a big way.
I may wake in the mornin' in Dallas
I went to bed in Tennesse
I need someone tellin' me where I am sometimes and where I'm suppose to be
Sometimes I wanna be George Jones sometimes Charlie Pride
But all I wanna be right now is with my baby tonight
[Chorus]
You know I can't complain (I can't complain)
I love this crazy dream
'Til I need some front porch rockin'
Some back road walkin'
Some sittin' around talkin' 'bout nothin'
I need some screen door slammin'
Some homemade jammin'
Some biscuits cookin' in the oven
I need a little fun with my little ones
A little gospel on Sunday
I need some hangin' 'round my little town
I need to take it slow I need some windin' down
I need my little town and I need it now
In a big way, in a big way
In a big way, yeah
I need some front porch rockin'
I need some back road walkin', I need
Some sittin' around talkin' about nothin',
About nothin' really nothin' at all
Oh, yeah!"
"It's not too late
Let me take you on a midnight drive
I might sound crazy baby
Maybe somewhere under the stars
In my car, in the dark
We can park, I don't care what we do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, the way you
Dance for me, dance for me
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
I'm gonna sit back baby
Sip that Jack and watch you move
It won't be long before
I'm swaying right up next to you
In the lights of the night
Burning bright
From up here on my hood
You look so damn good
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me
(Come on, come on)
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
I got you and the moon
And the right little tune
And you know what to do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah, dance for me, dance for me (come on, come on)
The way you dance for me, dance for me
Yeah, dance for me, dance for me (come on, come on)
The way you dance for me, dance for me"
"When you wrote me you said you were sorry
And you'd still want me for your friend
But now your heart no longer beats for me
I guess forever has come to and end
Now it must be like I never loved you
Like your sweet kiss was never mine
I must move on and stop thinking of you
But sorrow has no sense of time
Now the sun need no longer to shine dear
And the world need no longer to spin
For your love it has run out of time dear
And forever has come to an end
Now the arms that did once used to hold you
Are empty as your promise was
What's to become of the secrets I told you
Would tears run like a river does"
"I was a wild and reckless hobo left my girl and home
Started out on a western trip all by myself alone
My pocketbook was empty my heart was filled with pain
Thousand miles away from home just a bummin' an old freight train
Just a bummin' an old freight train oh Lord bummin' an old freight train
Thousand miles away from home just a bummin' an old freight train
I was standing on the platform smoking a cheap cigar
Waiting for an old feeight train to catch an empty car
My pocketbook was empty...
I pulled my cab down over my eyes I walked up to the track
I caught disturb of a sleeping car and never did look back
My pocketbook was empty..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Some men find her sexy, some men disagree
But if she's not, it's not because she doesn't want to be
She wears a push-up bra from Freddericks, five inch high heel shoes
Maybelline and Rubinstein, and Avon's best perfume
She's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
Some find her to aggressive, she don't know how to stop
Cause she's the kind that don't look down until it's from the top
She's elegant and stylish, French perfume and a fur
Designer clothes by Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg
And she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She has taken her place among the tallest of trees
But she weeps like a willow when she's brought to her knees
Cause she's a working girl
You'll find her dressed according to standard uniform
Cause she must dress in comfort for the job she must perform
She has so many faces, she wears so many names
She goes so many places and she does so many things
Cause she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl"
"Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King.
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing.
Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ,
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground.
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love"
"Last night we rode our broncs in Seattle,
Me and bill packed the car in the pourin' rain.
Witch and john were at the beer stand, gettin' sprung.
But we got 'em gathered and hit the road again.
Chewin' snoose and spittin' in a bottle.
With country music blastin' on the radio.
Talkin' girls and broncs and gold beltbuckles.
Rollin' south to a california rodeo.
Just rollin' down that great american highway,
With the mornin' sky lit up like a flame.
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow.
Like children runnin' through the rain.
Well it's rodeo time in oakdale, california.
And we stumble with the trash out of the car.
And ole bill looks at me through whiskers and wild, red eyeballs,
And says, we look more like hobo's than big-time rodeo stars.
Well we ride our broncs and we all win a little money.
And there's witch over at the beer stand again.
But look, he's got his arm around a little california honey.
An' bill says...i wonder if that lady there's got any friends.
Just rollin' down that great american highway,
With the mornin' sky lit up like a flame.
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow.
Like children runnin' through the rain.
Well, the years went by and now we've all got families.
Ah, but we still get together every now and then,
And we talk about all the bad broncs and good times.
Lord, somtimes I wish I was back on that road again
Just rollin' down that great american highway,
With the moernin' sky lit up like a flame.
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow.
Like children runnin' through the rain.
Just chasin dreams and followin' a rainbow
Like crazy children runnin' through the rain"
"There was a time when we'd be the last to leave
Watching the sun come up as everyone failed to see
The music was always loud and I'd smoke and drink too much
Till I fell into your arms into your loving touch
Now as the years roll by time has reeled me in
Slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then
Those old ways of mine I left them behind
Those crazy days are through
The only thing I still do like I use to do
Is carry this torch for you
Do you remember when we packed our bags and run
Chasing some crazy dream into the morning sun
Now as the twilight falls I find I'm satisfied
Watching the fire glow just as long as you're by my side
You're in my heart it seems time has passed me by
I love you as much today if very first time
Those old ways of mine I left them behind
Those crazy days are through
The only thing I still do like I use to do
Is carry this torch for you"
"There's a guy at the door wearing black eyeliner
There's a birthday girl goin' for an all-nighter
And the frat boys knockin' back shots with the bikers
Just another night with a buncha outsiders, yeah
All the neon signs lighting up our faces
Grab another round, add another for the waitress
The kick drum kicks in loud and our song's comin'
Through the speakers thumpin' all night long
All night long
Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Whoa, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here
Everybody sings
Everybody sings
We're dancing like fools with the music blasting
Trying not to spill the drinks in our glasses
No, we're not goin' home 'til the taps run dry
We're all shining in our own spotlight
Singing every line
It feels so right
Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Whoa, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here
Everybody sings
Everybody sings
Singin'
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping, stomping
Shaking, shaking
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Whoa, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here

"I've been a rolling stone all my life
Flying all alone, flying blind
I've seen it all, I've been around
I've been lost and I've been found
But who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
I've got a ways to go on this ride
But I got a hand to hold that fits just right
You make me laugh, you make me high,
You make me wanna hold on tight
'Cause who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Who I am with you
Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am
Who I am with you is who I really wanna be
You're so good for me
And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands
Yeah, a better man is who I am with you
Yes, who I am with you"
"We were playin' out in Vegas when this lady pressed her way up to the stage
I forgot what I was singin' when she met me with her meet-me-later gaze
When she threw it on my mic stand, I figured they were probably double-D's
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
One time I met one of my heroes, and he made me feel real good that I was there
'Cause whatever he was smokin', man, it had me spinnin' circles in my chair
I fell asleep on his bus in Texas, but I woke up in Memphis, Tennessee
That might make for a good story, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
[Chorus]
But I got a woman
Let me tell you that she's somethin'
You won't catch me doin' nothin'
To ever make her wanna leave
She knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
When you're livin' on a bus, and you fill it up with a bunch of real good timin' boys
Mix in applause, and alcohol, and honky tonks, you know we're bound to make some noise
But this rake-and-ramblin' life helps me write the kind of songs I wanna sing
'Cause it makes for real good stories, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me
[Chorus]
Yeah, she knows how much I love her, man
But that don't make it easy lovin' me"
"Seventeen years, how could we know?
And thirteen years to make a flower grow
Tears that fell from your eyes
Were the one's heaven cries
For the children left to walk alone
There is a light, no one can take
There is a chain of love no one can break
In all the world there is
No love greater than this
To lay down your life for your friends
And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
And did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did
You dance with all of your heart?
And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
Did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did
You dance with all of your heart?"
"On a trading path, through the Carolinas
Used by Indians who braved the wind and rain
They settled down beside the raging waters
And they worked the land until the white men came
And formed the counties
And they took away their land
And made the boundaries
Governed with a heavy hand
And you can almost hear the song
Of that old Indian longing for his home
Along the waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain and talking to the wind
They were friendly and they rode on painted horses
Fearing no one, not harming anything
They were trusting when the pilgrims came to live here
And then they died by the hands of the men
Who formed the counties
And they took away their land
And made the boundaries
Governed with a heavy hand
And you can almost hear that sad song
Of that old Indian crying for his home
Along the waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain and talking to the wind
They were trusting when they taught us how to live here
And then they scattered to the wind, leaving only tears behind them
And an old forgotten art
And all their memories, dying with a broken heart
And you almost hear the song
Of that old Indian longing for his home
Along that waters edge
Climbing mountains to escape
The laws of white men
Walking softly in the rain, talking to the wind"
"Hey I'm just staring out the window, baby don't mind me
But it's been a couple weeks since I walked on something but concrete
This big city's getting to me, I'm having hillbilly dreams
I'm hearing Haggard songs, it's been too long
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Cane pole stuck in the sand
That's the kind of mood that I'm in
I can't focus on anything else but getting us gone
I got this crazy desire to go out and sit by a fire
Maybe light up cheap cigars, Willy on guitar
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yeah, I'm thinking country
So just go with me baby, come on, help me concentrate
I know we're sitting downtown but I'm in some other
You know I'm in some other place
I'm thinking country, I'm talking hammer down
I mean one arm out the window like Smokey and the Bandit
Kind of good times, it's what I got on my mind
Let's go to Luckenbach, it's what I need
I can't help it, I'm just thinking country
Yes, I'm thinking country
It's been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Been a long time, been a long time gone
Been a long time since I've been home
Yeah I'm thinking country, I'm thinking country
Oh, I'm thinking country"

I've heard your voice,I've felt your touch
But only in dreams have I felt this much
I've not seen your face,I don't know your name
But here in my heart you have a place
I'm not for sure,but I believe
You're out there waiting for me
I'm waiting for you,biding my time
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
I'm waiting for you,taking it slow
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
I'm waiting for you
I can go on a date and have a good time
But you're always there in the back of my mind
I'll know it's you when you take my hand
And right by your side is where I will stand
I know how good it's gonna be
The moment that you find me
I'm waiting for you,biding my time
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
I'm waiting for you,taking it slow
Until the moment that I can let go
One day I know I'll say I do
I'm waiting for you"
"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair
And a smile that a girl understands.
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him
For temptation was flowing like wine.
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.

"If the light in your sky fades and darkness falls upon your face
When it seems you've lost your way and you can't take another day
I will calm all your fears
I will dry all your tears
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are
There's no wall that I can't climb
No road that I won't walk to find
Where you wander in the cold I'll get to you and take you home
I'll be right by your side just forget space and time
You'll see it doesn't matter near or far
Right next door or to the stars
My heart's already where you are"
"Obsecne desire of my obsession. I tried to make her my possesion, but love and lust must live free. Now the spell I threw, is coming back to me.
Chorus: Well I feel like I'm roped and tied. Shes takin me for a ride, slow suicide.
Black nights, and cloudy days. Blah blah blah. I can't see the point in staying alive. I'm going to the river to take a deep long dive."
"Donald and June enjoyed their brief honeymoon
Then they came home to lead the big baby boom
June wanted boys so Margie wore short hair and corduroys
Soon they had Claire then Linda and Louise a matching pair June liked boys
Donald and June they put some money aside
But all in four years they gave away three young brides
June spent it all Donald tried to keep each wedding small
When they were broke he offered Claire a thousand to elope Claire said Nope
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far
Donald and June had finally emptied their nest
They planned a long trip and then a couple years rest
But Claire had a spat and turned up with her suitcase and her cap
Marg moved next door now she won't need day care anymore and the twins had twins
If things were different for Donald and June then things wouldn't be what they are
Where did they go right and how did they ever come so far
Donald and June enjoyed their brief honeymoon"

This thing (this thing)
Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready

"Your broken heart is fading fast
You found a love you think might last
and last
The sweetest thing you've ever seen
The kind thats always in your dreams
in your dreams
She don't know that she's perfect
She does not have a clue
What she's done to you
She don't know that she's perfect
Better find the words to say
Don't let her walk away
Don't get me wrong
Don't think me strange
There's nothing about you girl
I wanna change
I'd never change you
But the day has come and now's the time
I'll find a way to make you say you're mine
Mine, all mine
She don't know that she's perfect
You'd better let her know
Before she turns to go
I hope and pray she'll understand
That one fine day
I might be her man
Be her man
We'll find a place down in the sun
Where she and I can live as one
By faith
Till the end"
"Johnnie, you've got your head in the clouds --
You've got me screaming out loud, but you can't hear me.
And Johnnie, I think you're blind to my pain --
You've got me going insane; I'm barely breathing.
And I've been setting off to go for how long --
I do not know.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead, but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
""Don't hold your breath.""
Johnnie, you just ain't worth the risk,
'Cuz I can't fix these growing pains.
And it's not funny --
You don't know what you're doing to me.
Johnnie, oh baby, it's not your fault.
And I've been setting off to go for how long --
I do not know.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead, but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
Wish I may I wish I might
Not have the wish I wish tonight.
I'm blowing dandelion kisses trying to turn weeds into wishes;
Trying to make rags into riches over you.
Should've stuck to stars instead but now my face is turning red
and I remember -- as you always said:
""Don't hold your breath.""
You see I'm stuck here, it's true --
Can't you see it's 'cuz of you."
"I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see;
I won't be much when you get through' with me
Well, I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb;
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
But now, the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see;
I won't be much when you get through' with me
Well,I'm a losing weight and a turnin' mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, ev'ry night you drag me where the bright lights are found;
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm as 'bout as helpless as a leaf in a gale;
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail"
"The minute you're gone I cry the minute you're gone I die
Before you walk out of sight I'm like a child all alone at night
I stare into emptiness I'm filled with such loneliness
The world goes from right to wrong the minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see oh how lonely a girl I'll be
My life would be oh so blue if I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see..."
"If all of my life I try and I try
Baby I could never show you
All this love I have inside
'Cause every day when we wake
I look deep into your eyes, I realize
[Chorus]
I could kiss you in the rain forever
Turn all of your pain to pleasure
Fill up all your days with sunlight
Make the passion last every night
Give you my every possession
Make you my only obsession
Climb up to the sky
And pull down all the stars above
But I could never love you enough
If I could have one wish it would just be this
That I could take you to my soul
And show you all the love there is
This never ending sea deep inside of me
There's no stopping it baby, even if
[Chorus]
No matter what I do
It's never as much as I want to
Baby it could never be enough

"On the wrong end of the highway
When the long night has no end
When there's no one there beside me
'Til I hold you once again

Thank God for the radio
When I'm on the road
When I'm far from home
And feelin' blue
Thank God for the radio
Playin' all night long
Playin' all the songs
That mean so much to me and you
There's a song that we first danced to
And there's a song they played the night we met
And there's a song we first made love to
That's a song I'll never forget
[Chorus]
Playin' all the songs
Than mean so much to me and you
Thank God for the radio"
"I don't love you anymore not the way I did before
And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore for I've got no more love to give
You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
[ piano ]
I held you close to me one time kissed your lips and called you mine
But another came and thrilled you more I guess
I cried as you walked out the door I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less
I don't love you anymore...
Trouble is I don't love you any less"
"I had a most distressing dream last night
I dreamed I was a crystal bird
Caught in perpetual flight
I'd ascend and glide and descend and ride
On the wind and never alight
I had a most distressing dream last night
Glass enclosed, exposed wherever I flew
With no control and a crystal soul
That one could see right through
No ethereal nest where I could rest
I was frightened by what I knew
That my two crystal legs were broken in two
When I awoke my heart was beating fast
As if all night and endless flight
An eternity had passed
As I shook my head and slipped from my bed
Released from the prism, at last
I stepped upon a bit of shattered glass"
"What's that look, you're giving me
Staring me down with fire in your eyes
But it's alright baby, cause you look so good
When you're giving me a hard time
I can tell by your smile
That making up might take a while
[Chorus]
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Wrap yourself around this heart of mine
Let's count the stars in each others eyes
Maybe we should lose some sleep tonight
Yeah, that's right, I meant what I said
I'm getting tired of playing around
That's enough, I've had it up to here
Let's settle this right now
Who said, it wasn't any fun
I hope we're in for a long one
[Chorus]
Baby laying here with you now
Makes me want to drag this whole thing down
[Chorus]"
"Sometimes we get running low on love
Ain't got enough to push, ain't got enough to shove, to keep my head up
Like I'm drowning in a pool of missing you
Seems like we see less of each other every day
I'm coming your going the opposite way, when those feelings fade
I know just what to do
Drink it up, take it in, take you more places than you've ever been
'Cause we can make more love every night
Sometimes we're so close you can't tell us apart
I can feel every beat of your precious heart, oh but that's just a start
Where I'm taking you baby
Drink it up, take it in, take you more places than you've ever been
'Cause we can make more love every night
More love, oh Baby I can't get enough
More love, to keep it rollin' steady baby it's up to us
Drink it up, take it in, take you more places than you've ever been
'Cause we can make more love every night
Drink it up, take it in, take you more places than you've ever been
'Cause we can make more love every night"
"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Fade:
Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come..."
"She opened up the letter from Nashville Tennessee
He said hon they like my music the songs I wrote for you and me
The boys and me just cut a record and it could hit the charts before too long
So it's gonna be a while till I can come back home
Yes I'm gonna be a country star and everyone will know my name
Oh you know I love those bright lights when I step on stage to sing
I'll be travlin' round the country with a big bus and a band
So just keep the homefires burnin' while I'm gone
And I'll get home when I can
She said hon I hear your record oh they play it everyday
And everybody really likes it so I guess your on your way
But darling please remember we all need you here at home
And the kids all miss their daddy so don't be gone too long
Yes I know that your a country star and everybody knows your name
And I know you love those bright lights when you step on stage to sing
Just remember we all love you and don't get blinded by the light
We'll just keep the homefires burnin' while you're gone
You know we pray for you each night
After six long months of goin' I guess the road just finally took its toll
Cause his songs has lost all meaning and he felt so all alone
Then one night in Jackson he went out on stage to play
And the crowd stared at disbelief at the words he had to say
I don't want to be a country star it ain't the way I thought it'd be
Well it took me such a long time to know that it ain't the life for me
Cause the days can get so lonely and the nights can get so long
Lord I think it's about time this country star went home
Yes I think that it's about time this country boy went home"
"Sitting all alone with my whisky on ice,
I wonder why he's not with me tonight.
If the rain be on tonight then I won't sleep.
I'm haunted by this loneliness I keep.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.
It doesn't seem much point in us carrying on,
We pretend to cry but the feelings are gone.
I hear the death man has lost his mate,
The silence that follows him tells me about our fate.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight.
Empty glass before me tells the story in my eyes,
The dimness it has giving me won't let me realize.
That love is more or less the state of mind we go through,
With no guarantee to what it holds me or you.
And it's too late to cry cause we left it all behind,
Too late to cry cause there's nothing left defied.
You won't get more than you're living for,
And it's too late to cry tonight."
"Well, I got a picture
It's glued in a book
Of most of my family
That somebody took
Well, grandpa died early
Before I could know
The man that they tell me
I take after so
Well, I don't remember
It still makes me laugh
When I see us together
In a photograph
Well, mama and daddy
Burned hot like a flame
But it all turned to ashes
With no one to blame
And I can still see them
But not in my mind
And it's been so long
All my memories lie
Well, I can't remember
It still makes me laugh
When I see us together
In a photograph
Well, it happened last winter
We had a son
They took a picture
Of family, round one
It's there to remind you
When you can't recall
What your daddy looked like
When you were so small
Though you won't remember
It'll still make you laugh
When you see us together
In a photograph
No, you won't remember
It'll still make you laugh
When you see us together
In a photograph"
"I can smell the onions floating in the air
Must be something that you ate
I can't imagine how your mouth must taste
Forgive me if I turn away
The slightest whiff just brings me to my knees
Almost pass out in your arms
I need a gas mask every time that you come near
And the halitosis starts
I can smell your breath
It's choking me to death
The only who doesn't know is you
Here's some gum to chew
Er, baby there's no way you're kissing me
What you have for lunch?
Don't you ever brush?
Maybe a Binaca Blast or two is what I'd suggest
I can smell your breath
Bad breath
It's tough to be there when you're waking up
And that green cloud fills up the room
It's worser than it's ever been before
And I know and you know
And everybody in a three mile radius knows
You should a dentist soon
'Cause I can smell your breath
It's gagging me to death
Something must have died inside of you
What you ought to do
Is chase a Cert or two
With Listerine
Even when you're gone
The odor lingers on
I'm buying you an Oral be and a jumbo tube of Crest
'Cause I can smell your breath
Bad breath
Can't you smell the fog that's floating through the air
Must be something that you ate"
"Day one god smiled
Gave us all the wisdom of a new born child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget
What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find
Where the light comes from
[Chorus]
And it's a world of hurt
Nothing works
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Who'd ever thinks that in de midst of all this
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when i hold you and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
You make me feel so good
Day one of our love
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
Oh here it's comes that feelin' again
What every lover swears will never end
We thought we'd been there, done that,
But when we've kissed,
We knew we'd never been her...
We've never done this
All the walls comes tumblin' down
When you love someone
[Chorus]"
"My love swears that he is made of truth
I do believe him though I know he lies
I've caught him creeping 'round darkened holes
I've caught him staring at distant skies
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the notes fall slow
Slow
My love lives inside a haze of gloom
He fears today, what might come tomorrow
Seeks the shadow, shuns the light
Bleeds for knowledge, prepares for sorrow
I would have seen it coming but I'm blind with age
Too much time on the battle line
Shut it all out just let the note fall slow
Slow
This ain't no depression, just notes falling slow
An early snow and notes falling slow
Do I have the strength to bear their passion?
An early snow and notes falling slow"
"Thanks thanks a lot got a broken heart that's all I've got
You made me cry and I cried a lot I lost your love baby thanks a lot
You told our friends as I was passin' by that you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserve everything I've got that's how you feel honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot
You wanted a fool I played the part now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little yeah we laughed a lot and then you're gone honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot
Baby thanks a lot baby thanks a lot baby thanks a lot"
"Where do I start, lying on a blanket underneath the stars
With your head on my chest
I always liked that best
I hate how time flies
I still think back sometimes
'Bout your lips on my neck
I always liked that best
That time we took a ride
Ended up down by the riverside
Soft touch, wet kiss
I always liked that best
I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
Ya came to know me well, well, well
Falling to sleep
Wearing your shirt 'cause it smelled so sweet
Who could forget
I always liked that best
Or loosing my heart
Everytime ya sing to me on your guitar
Lady in Red
I always liked that best
I like the way you used to hold me
I like the way you came to know me
Ya came to know me well, well, well
I could go on
So many things I miss now that you're gone
Your love, oh yes
I always liked that best"
"When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Take me and make me your lover one more time
Close in your arms as before
'Til o'er your shoulder the early morning shines
Then I'll leave you and grieve you no more
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Daises need sunshine and roses need rain
So it was all meant to be
A wild bird needs wings, free to take to the wind
And so it was meant for you and me
When time was young we walked the roads together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Teardrops will kiss the morning dew"
"I'm just driftwood on the river floating down the tide
I don't care where this old river carries me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken inside
And I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be
(I may meet some little driftwood lost as same as I
Share a handshake and a tender tear or two)
But it's always good luck how we got to say goodbye
I must wander on to keep my rendezvous
Though I drift through town and city I can never stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet home
I don't ask for help or pitty I just go my way
All I'm praying for is peace to dream alone
(I'm just driftwood on the river and I'm drifting on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue sea)
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget someone
Yes the careless one who has forgotten me
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has been
I feel sorry for the one I must forget
And instead of being someone with the world to win
I'm just driftwood on the river of regret"
