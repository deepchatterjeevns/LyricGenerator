 spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okaytheres always some reason to feel not good enough and its hard at the end of the dayi need some distraction oh beautiful release memories seep from my veinsand maybe empty oh and weightless and maybe ill find some peace tonightin the arms of the angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie youre in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort hereso tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn theres vultures and thieves at your backthe storm keeps on twisting keep on building the lies that you make up for all that you lackit dont make no difference escape one last time its easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my kneesin the arms of the angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie youre in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort hereyoure in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here
