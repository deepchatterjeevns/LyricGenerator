without you theres no change my nights and days are gray if i reached out and touched the rain it wouldnt feel the same without you id be lost id slip down from the top slide down so low youd never know without you without you sailor lost at sea without you woman the world comes down on me without you in my life id slowly wilt and die but with you by my side youre the reason im alive but with you in my life youre the reason im alive but without you without you without you my hope is small let me be me all along you let the fires rage inside knowing someday id grow strong without you without you sailor lost at sea without you woman the world comes down on me without you in my life id slowly wilt and die but with you by my side youre the reason im alive but with you in my life youre the reason im alive but without you without you
