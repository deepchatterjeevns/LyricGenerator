 open your eyes i see your eyes are open wear no disguise for me come into the openwhen its cold outside am i here in vain hold on to the night there will be no shamealways i want to be with you and make believe with you and live in harmony harmony oh lovemelting the ice for me jump into the ocean hold back the tide i see your love in motionwhen its cold outside am i here in vain hold on to the night there will be no shamealways i want to be with you and make believe with you and live in harmony harmony oh love
