where i was born everything was dull and dingy i lived in a place they called the inner city getting ahead was strictly a no no cause nobody cares what happens to the folks that live in the ghetto thousands of lives wasting away people living from day to day its a challenge just staying alive cause in the ghetto only the strong survives broken down homes kids strung out they dont even know what lifes all about stealin cars robbin bars muggings drugs rat infested and no ones interested kids dodging cars for recreation only adds to a mothers frustration breakins folks comin home and finding all their possessions gone oh its an everyday thing well well in the ghetto oh its an everyday thing in the ghetto
