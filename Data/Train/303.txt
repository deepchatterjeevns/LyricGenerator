therell be no strings to bing your hands not if my love cant bind your heart and theres no need to take a stand for it was i who chose to start i see no reason to take me home im old enough to face the dawn just call me angel of the morning angel just touch my cheek before you leave me baby just call me angel of the morning angel then slowly turn away from me maybe the suns light will be dim and it wont matter anyhow if mornings echo says weve sinned well it was what i wanted now and if were victims of the night i wont be blinded by the light just call me angel of the morning angel just touch my cheek before you leave me baby just call me angel of the morning angel then slowly turn away i wont beg you to stay with me through the tears of the day of the years baaaby just call me angel of the morning angel just touch my cheek before you leave me baby
