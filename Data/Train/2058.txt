 ive heard talk of blind devotion lovers through thick and thin lives touched with real emotion faithful til the bitter endnow i must admit that the storys attractive ive lost in far too many affairs ive seen all the pain that the morning can bring i need to prove to myself this is more than a crush can you convince me its not just the physical rushis this love that im feelin is this love thats been keepin me up all night is this love that im feelin is this loveso many nights in blind confusion ive walked the line of love we reach out in disillusion when one night isnt nearly enoughnow id like to know that for once in my life im sure of what tomorrow may bring ive heard all your talk can i take it to heart now look me straight in the eye cause tonight is the night weve got to ask each other if the moment is rightis this love that im feelin is this love thats been keepin me up all night is this love that im feelin is this loveive tread those mean streets blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands all touch no feeling just another one night stand i need to know that theres someone who cares could you be the angel to answer my prayersis this love that im feelin is this love thats been keepin me up all night is this love that im feelin is this loveis this love that im feelin is this love thats been keepin me up all night is this love that im feelin is this love is this love
