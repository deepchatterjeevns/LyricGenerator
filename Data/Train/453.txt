when youre weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes i will dry them all im on your side oh when times get rough and friends just cant be found like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down when youre down and out when youre on the street when evening falls so hard i will comfort you ill take your part oh when darkness comes and pain is all around like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down like a bridge over troubled water i will lay me down sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine all your dreams are on their way see how they shine oh if you need a friend im sailing right behind like a bridge over troubled water i will ease your mind like a bridge over troubled water i will ease your mind
