when im feeling blue all i have to do  is take a look at you then im not so blue  when youre close to me i can feel your heart beat  i can hear you breathing near my ear  wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love  anytime you want to you can turn me onto  anything you want to anytime at all  when i kiss your lips ooh i start to shiver  cant control the quivering inside  wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love oh  when im feeling blue all i have to do  is take a look at you then im not so blue  when im in your arms nothing seems to matter  my whole world could shatter i dont care  wouldnt you agree baby you and me got a groovy kind of love  we got a groovy kind of love  we got a groovy kind of love oh  we got a groovy kind of love
