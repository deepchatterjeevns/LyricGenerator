 looking back on when i was a little nappy headed boy then my only worry was for christmas what would be my toy even though we sometimes would not get a thing we were happy with the joy the day would bring sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine greeted at the back door but thought i told you not to go outside tryin your best to bring the water to your eyes thinkin it might stop her from woopin your behind i wish those days could come back once more why did those days ever have to go i wish those days could come back once more why did those days ever have to go cause i love them so brother says hes tellin bout you playin doctor with that girl just dont tell ill give you anything you want in this whole wide world mama gives you money for sunday school you trade yours for candy after church is through smokin cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall you nasty boy teacher sends you to the principals office down the wall you grow up and learn that kinda thing aint right but while you were doinitit sure felt outta sight i wish those days could come back once more why did those days ever have to go i wish those days could come back once more why did those days ever have to go
