 i know theres something in the wake of your smile i get a notion from the look in your eyes yea youve built a love but that love falls apart your little piece of heaven turns too dark listen to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do i dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile the precious moments are all lost in the tide yea theyre swept away and nothing is what is seems the feeling of belonging to your dreams listen to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do i dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye and there are voices that want to be heard so much to mention but you cant find the words the sense of magic the beauty thats been when love was wilder than the wind listen to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart theres nothing else you can do i dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before listen to your heart when hes calling for you listen to your heart take a listen theres nothing else you can do i dont know where youre going and i dont know why but listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye listen to your heart listen to your heart take a listen to it listen to your heart take a listen to it listen to your heart yeah listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart listen to your heart
