 if a picture paints a thousand words then why cant i paint you the words will never show the you ive come to know if a face could launch a thousand ships then where am i to go theres no one home but you youre all thats left me tooand when my love for life is running dry you come and pour yourself on meif a man could be two places at one time id be with you tomorrow and today beside you all the way if the world should stop revolvin spinning slowly down to die id spend the end with you and when the world was throughthen one by one the stars would all go out then you and i would simply fly away
